was followed by a letter explaining why the Government did not actually want an extension.There was also an explanatory letter from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u0027s ambassador to the EU, saying that the request was \u0027as required\u0027 by the Benn Act.The Act is intended to stop a No Deal Brexit on October 31.           This unsigned letter was sent to Brussels last night after the PM was forced to request an extension following his defeat in the Commons yesterdayWill the EU agree to an extension?Unclear. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said last week there was \u0027no need\u0027 for another delay, but it is not his decision to make. The decision will be taken by the leaders of the 27 remaining EU states, including Angela Merkel of Germany and Emmanuel Macron of France. Mr Macron has previously been sceptical of Brexit delays, but EU leaders may be unwilling to risk a No Deal scenario. Brussels could also decide to sit on the letter and wait and see whether Mr Johnson can get his deal through Parliament before October 31. The Prime Minister insists he can get his legislation passed before then, meaning Britain could leave without a further delay. He has repeatedly promised to leave on October 31 \u0027do or die\u0027 and will be reluctant to break that promise.                French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) are among the EU leaders who will have to decide whether to grant an extensionCan there still be a No Deal Brexit?The Commons vote yesterday was intended to head off the possibility of a No Deal Brexit by effectively forcing Mr Johnson to demand a delay. But if the EU refuses, Parliament would have a race against time to pass the deal before October 31 and prevent a cliff-edge exit.  Will there be an emergency EU summit?If the PM gets the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, there could be a special gathering of leaders on October 28.If the deal needs more time at that stage to get through Parliament, leaders could agree to a short \u0027technical\u0027 extension.Will the PM face another court battle?Remainers will resume their court battle against Mr Johnson tomorrow, arguing that he flouted the \u0027spirit\u0027 of the Benn Act by telling Brussels he did not really want a delay.The PM and his allies say he complied with the law by sending the request to Brussels last night. European Council chief Donald Tusk appeared to accept the request as valid last night.          Scottish MP Joanna Cherry (pictured during an anti-Brexit rally in Westminster yesterday) will continue to drag Boris Johnson through the courts tomorrowHowever, Labour\u0027s John McDonnell today accused the PM of \u0027clearly trying to undermine\u0027 the request with his separate letter. Attention in legal circles has turned to the little known \u0027Padfield principle\u0027 stating that ministers cannot try to frustrate the purpose of a law.  Mr Johnson has already faced one embarrassing court defeat when the Supreme Court ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful. Will there be a General Election?Boris Johnson has already tried twice to force an early election but his plans were scuppered by opposition MPs. Labour has said it will back an election when a No Deal exit is \u0027off the table\u0027 - which is not yet the case. Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s party has previously voiced fears that Mr Johnson would force through a No Deal while Parliament was dissolved.  However, Mr Corbyn may back an election if another Brexit delay is agreed. Alternatively, Mr Johnson could try to force an election without Labour support, but that could get him bogged down in further parliamentary manoeuvring.   "},{"url":null,"title":"First look Jennifer Lawrence Cooke Maroney leaving wedding partying 5 30am","story":"Rule in red like Sienne wearing Johanna OrtizSold out!

The thin atmosphere, containing almost no oxygen, is unbreathable. Intense solar radiation, were you to survive the cold and asphyxiation, would be lethal. It would take seven months and billions of pounds to get there. Growing enough food on the red planet to live off would be, to put it mildly, difficult, so you’d have to bring it with you.All of which makes the idea, once expressed by Stephen Hawking and now Elon Musk, that humanity might look to Mars as a planet B if things get really bad here terrifying. It implies that conditions on Earth would actually have to be worse than that unappealing Martian atmospheric cocktail. In which situation only an elite handful would make the escape, a handful that would include (in the imagination, one suspects, of Elon Musk) people very like Elon Musk.One of the most thought-provoking exhibits in the Design Museum’s Moving to Mars exhibition is therefore the proposal by the artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg that we send plants and bacteria there instead, of a kind that could survive and propagate in the planet’s harsh conditions. It would require a certain disinterest, species-wise – the aim would be to continue life in this cosmic ark, but not human life – but it’s a refreshing variation on the more familiar concept of hero-pioneers efficiently setting up home in hi-tech colonies.It’s also reasonable to ask, given rapid progress in robotics, whether it will ever make sense to send human explorers. In an age when robots can land on comets, the laborious ferrying of flesh and blood through our particular corner of the solar system begins to look old-fashioned. Despite all such reasoned objection, the thought of human travel to Mars is a powerful and romantic one. It’s also one on which Musk, Nasa and other agencies are prepared to lavish significant amounts of speculative investment.The Design Museum’s show is both a picture of a human idea and a sampling of intense human ingenuity. It starts with some of the speculation and fiction that the fourth planet from the sun has inspired. It shows, with the help of life-size mockups, proposals by the design company Hassell to get swarms of 3D-printing robots to build anti-radiation shelters out of regolith (the loose material of stones and dust on the surface of Mars) under which inflatable habitations could be inserted.Fiction and science often come closely entwined, as in the vivid paintings with which the architecturally trained Chesley Bonestell brought to life proposals for Mars travel by Wernher von Braun, the man who moved from designing V2 missiles for Hitler to moon rockets for Nasa. The Design Museum, keen to mount an exhibition that might otherwise seem better suited to the Science Museum, is at pains to stress the human and the cultural, as well as the purely technical, aspects of the subject.To this end it exhibits material on the design of environments to help the wellbeing and sanity of astronauts. The celebrated American designer Raymond Loewy, who started his career designing steam locomotives and ended it designing the 1970s space station Skylab, makes an appearance. He insisted on the simple but effective measure, which seemingly hadn’t occurred to the project’s engineers, of installing a window. Astronauts were happier if they could look outside.So it’s an intelligent and thoughtful exhibition. Its most compelling sensation, though, is one of wonder. Here, for example, is a full-size working model of one of the rovers that have been wandering this alien world these past several years, filming the view and gathering samples. It looks both sophisticated and basic – almost agricultural – at once. And here is a triptych of large screens on which you can see some of the footage the vehicle has sent back. It puts you right there, in the middle of a hard desert landscape half like the more arid parts of our planet, but also quite different.No one should get blase about this achievement, even though the first such Mars visits were more than 40 years ago. It is stupendous. For good measure the Design Museum has installed, on the floor from which you watch the screens, a knobbly surface that imitates that of Mars. The planet’s scent is also pumped into the room. It’s a sort of dry must, something like old suede.In Against Nature, the great decadent 1884 novel by Joris-Karl Huysmans, the hero buys a ticket to go to London from Paris. Before catching his train, he dines in an English restaurant, among red-faced eaters of beef. The weather happens to be rainy and foggy. He eventually decides that, having experienced the people and weather of England so comprehensively, he has no need actually to go there.My instinct is that we should do the same with Mars – dream about it, fascinate ourselves with the information and images sent back by the rovers, but not try to turn into reality the fantasy of migrating there. Rather better, as an environmentalist filmed in the exhibition says, to work on the planet we already have.• At the Design Museum, London, until 23 Feb 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a8f92a00bea785a59cecd70cb75ee85a69a6c0/0_81_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfb48490e6e50401a0bada929fb57cce 1140w","title":"silver skaters the rise of skateboarding in california in pictures","story":"Legendary skateboard photographer Hugh Holland has published a book of previously unseen images capturing the growth of the skateboarding craze in California.

Perhaps because it cast a shadow over his career (how could he have found himself so drawn to this monster?), Theroux spends a lot of time grappling with his feelings about the affair.

He was also a director of the online bookmaker 666Bet, which was promoted by the football manager Harry Redknapp before it went out of business.Filings relating to the liquidation of Bell’s former businesses state: “Global claims of £67m were identified which could be validly pursued against Mr Bell … Following mediation, all claims against Bell and the underlying dispute were compromised by way of a confidential settlement agreement … All settled monies are to be received by Gateley PLC (the joint liquidators’ solicitors) via Hill Dickinson LLP, on behalf of Mr Bell, in accordance with the settlement.”Separate court filings detailing the settled claims showed how Bell stood accused by his former businesses of making payments that “were not made to discharge bona fide liabilities”, while he was also said to have disbursed funds “for the improper purpose of benefiting the defendant, his family, associates andor other companies in which he was interested”.The documents claim that one of his former companies, the Gibraltar-based MG Engineering \u0026amp Consultancy, suffered losses of more than £45m because of the financier’s actions. A further 12 companies were said to have lost sums ranging from more than £6m down to £90,000.In his defence documents, Bell denied wrongdoing and said he did not admit that his companies had suffered loss or damage because of his alleged actions.The confidentiality agreement surrounding the settlement means that it is not yet clear how much of the £67m of claims Bell will end up paying, although some payments have begun to trickle in.Filings made at Companies House show that, so far, £273,517.41 has been received by EV Construction \u0026amp Management, plus a further £200,899.54 by Pavillion Management Services, two of six former Bell companies that launched legal claims against their former owner.One insolvency expert said: “Ultimately the liquidator will have to declare how much has been paid by statute. Probably, Paul Bell wants to defer public knowledge of what has been paid for some time.”The financier has been investigated by the taxman for an alleged massive VAT fraud carried out through payroll companies that processed hundreds of millions of pounds in wages for legitimate businesses. While he was arrested in 2015, he has not been charged and he has previously “vigorously denied any wrongdoing”.HMRC and the Isle of Man police declined to comment.RSM said it could not provide details of the agreement. Bell did not respond to efforts to contact him directly or via his law firm, Hill Dickinson.

Well, they had enough time: 19 hours and 16 minutes to be precise.Aviation history was made at 7.43am on Sunday when Qantas flight QF7879 touched down at Sydney airport, completing the world’s longest ever commercial flight. It had taken off from New York’s JFK airport at 9.27pm on Friday night. Along the way, it produced the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions of burning more than 700 barrels of oil.Just 49 people – including six pilots, six members of cabin crew including a chef, a handful of reporters, six frequent flyers and the airline’s chief executive, Alan Joyce – were on board the Airbus Dreamliner flight, designed to test whether passengers can endure the physical and mental effects of extremely long aeroplane journeys.The flight was restricted to such a small number of passengers in order to ensure that it was light enough to make it all the way to Australia on one tank of fuel. In order to reduce the weight, strict restrictions were put in place, including limiting passengers’ luggage and destocking most of the bar. All the passengers were in business class.The plane was loaded with 101 tonnes of jet fuel, which made up almost half the total weight of the plane on takeoff. A Qantas spokesman was unable to explain how much carbon dioxide the flight created, but said all carbon emissions from the flight would be offset. The spokesman suggested that the carbon footprint of the direct flight would be less than that created by a two-leg journey because most energy used in flying is on takeoff.The International Civil Aviation Organization, which is part of the United Nations, estimates that 3.15 grams of carbon dioxide are produced for every gram of jet fuel burned. This would suggest that the flight created about 310 tonnes of carbon dioxide – the equivalent to the CO2 emitted by the use of four full tankers of petrol or that of about 718 barrels of oil, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.Britain’s Committee on Climate Change said any new flights that expanded the market for long-haul travel would hinder the legally binding commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.The flight covered 16,200 kms (10,200 miles) – about 900km further than the current longest commercial flight between Singapore and New York.The flight, on a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner named Kookaburra (a type of Australian kingfisher), was the first of three test flights exploring the practicalities of ultra-long -distance commercial aviation as part of Qantas’s Project Sunrise. Next month, Qantas will test a direct flight from Heathrow to Sydney, which will set a new distance record of 17,000km and take about 19.5 hours.Joyce said upon landing in Sydney: “This is a really significant first for aviation. Hopefully, it’s a preview of a regular service that will speed up how people travel from one side of the globe to the other.“We know ultra-long-haul flights pose some extra challenges, but that’s been true every time technology has allowed us to fly further. The research we’re doing should give us better strategies for improving comfort and wellbeing along the way.”The passengers boarding the flight at 9pm in New York were told to reset their watches to Sydney time as soon as they boarded, and were kept awake with the lights on for six hours and served a spicy soup and fish lunch designed to keep them up for longer to reduce jetlag. The chef said he had been preparing the meals on the flight for three days.As the flight flew over Las Vegas, passengers were led from their business class seats to the empty economy cabin in a rendition of La Macarena designed to get the blood pumping around their bodies. Pilots, passengers and crew were also subjected to a battery of health and wellbeing checks designed to test the effects of ultra-long-haul flying. All crew members wore activity monitors and completed sleep diaries and alertness logs during the flight, and in the two weeks leading up to it.Cameras were mounted in the cockpit to “record alertness cues and operational activities” and the pilots wore EEG (electroencephalogram) brain monitoring equipment to monitor them for alertness and sleep. With demand for air travel rapidly growing and aircraft performance improving, carriers are increasingly looking into ultra-long-haul travel. The International Air Transport Association expects the worldwide number of annual passengers to increase from 4.6 billion this year to 8.2 billion by 2037.Qantas captain Sean Golding said flying the plane was the highlight of his career. “The flight was very successful from two components,” he said. “The first one was research. And also the feat of distance – that flight last night was 16,200 kilometres. We were airborne for 19 hours and 16 minutes, and we landed here in Sydney with a comfortable 70 minutes of fuel.”The QF7879 flight landed in Sydney a few minutes before the airline’s regular New York to Sydney service QF12, which stops in Los Angeles. QF12 had taken off from New York three hours before QF7879."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de088144f284feb475be1607e4e38245ac0b9c76/0_117_3054_1834/master/3054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd47d3c38fde7073abc96b083be9cac4","title":"the sluggish global economy needs to reform and fast","story":"Mervyn King’s IMF speech turned heads – dangerously little has changed since the 2008 financial crisisThey were all there. Mario Draghi, in his last few weeks as president of the European Central Bank before handing over to Christine Lagarde Mark Carney, who will be leaving the Bank of England in January provided the UK government ever finds the time to appoint a new governor and Jay Powell, the man Donald Trump now deeply regrets ever choosing to run the Federal Reserve.Yet all these members of the financial elite were upstaged by someone who retired from the central banking fraternity six years ago. Lord Mervyn King showed up in Washington to give the Per Jacobsson lecture, a showcase occasion at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, and proceeded to make by some distance the most arresting intervention of the week.King’s argument was simple. The synchronised slowdown in the global economy identified by the IMF’s new managing director – Kristalina Georgieva – is more than a temporary phenomenon. Instead, it is a reflection of how the failure to address the reasons for the financial crisis of 2008-09 has left the world economy stuck in a permanent low-growth trap.Policymakers have patted themselves on the back for the way in which their emergency action at the height of the banking meltdown in 2008 prevented a repeat of the 1930s. By cutting interest rates, creating new electronic money and bailing out the banks, governments ensured there was nothing like the loss of output or the increase in unemployment seen during the Great Depression.But the Great Depression led to big changes in economics – the Keynesian revolution – and this paved the way for a political rethink. The same applied to the mid-1970s, when the shift to the political right was made possible by a group of economists who challenged the Keynesian orthodoxy.King’s view – and he is right – is that there has been nothing remotely comparable since the financial crisis of 2008. Economies have been kept ticking over by monetary easing – low interest rates and quantitative easing – but none of the fundamental issues have been tackled.This is not just a question of the law of diminishing returns, with each dollop of stimulus proving less effective at boosting activity than the last. It is also, as the IMF noted last week, creating the conditions for the next financial crash. Why? Because when central banks send out the message that interest rates are going to stay low for ever, it encourages iniduals and companies to load up on debt. This is fine until a recession arrives, causing iniduals to lose their jobs and companies to see product demand collapse. In those circumstances, the debt becomes unpayable, and a wave of bankruptcies amplifies the initial economic shock.Most central bankers are aware of the limitations of monetary policy. Carney said in Washington that there was the risk of a global liquidity trap – where people hoard cash and even rock-bottom interest rates are ineffective. Draghi would agree with the IMF that countries such as Germany and the Netherlands should run down their budget surpluses to take some of the pressure off the ECB.In the short term, policymakers are going to shift towards a more active use of fiscal policy, cutting taxes and increasing public spending. The UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, said in his flying visit to Washington last week that it made sense to borrow money for infrastructure projects when the government could borrow money at such cheap rates, and he is absolutely right about that.But with debt levels high, governments are going to be quite cautious about deploying the sort of fiscal stimulus that would really make a difference. In any event, the global deficiency of demand is a structural problem that requires a structural response.Both King and his successor have their solutions. Carney says one big problem is that the dollar is too powerful a reserve currency given that the US share of global GDP is shrinking. He says changes in technology make it possible to envisage a new digital currency that could be provided through a network of central banks and would eventually rival the dollar.King says there need to be country-specific changes so that, for example, China and Germany become less export-dependent while other countries become less reliant on commercial property.Resolving the global imbalances between countries that save too much and those that save too little was a familiar refrain of King when he was the Bank’s governor. The fact that he is still singing the same song shows how little has changed. And that is deeply concerning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c896a81c1a0a3a0683f7b10c5dfea342515358/0_109_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461c1dcced068c8b7e357b3faac036f8","title":"thomas cook mps to question pwc on possible conflict of interest","story":"Questions raised over firm’s dual role as executive pay adviser and auditorBosses at PricewaterhouseCoopers will be grilled by MPs on Tuesday over a possible conflict of interest after it emerged that the accountancy firm advised Thomas Cook executives about their pay and bonuses while it was also the travel company’s external auditor.A parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of Thomas Cook is under way and is focusing on executive pay, accounting practices and the role of auditors. At a sometimes combative hearing on 15 October, the fallen tour operator’s bosses drew stinging criticism for the millions of pounds of bonuses paid to directors in the years running up to its demise.In its recent written submission to MPs, the Institute of Directors talked about “the allegedly aggressive accounting methods” adopted at Thomas Cook. Meanwhile, in recent days both MPs and the IoD have voiced concerns that directors’ pay and bonuses were calculated on profit numbers that excluded one-off negative items. “Were accounting judgements therefore being affected by executive pay considerations?” asked the IoD.PwC audited the business between 2008 and 2016, with EY taking over the following year. Now it has come to light that for a period of time, PwC performed a dual role as both the Thomas Cook remuneration committee’s adviser and the company’s external auditor.Thomas Cook’s 2009 annual report stated that the remuneration committee “was mindful of the dual role” performed by PwC. It said: “PwC held this dual role because prior to the merger they had acted as remuneration adviser to MyTravel Group plc and external auditor to Thomas Cook.”In June 2009, another firm, Kepler Associates, was appointed external adviser to the remuneration committee.In 2016, rules were introduced that meant auditors could no longer provide any remuneration advice.On 22 October, MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee are due to question executives from both PwC and EY. The inquiry’s terms of reference specifically include accounting practices “and the audits conducted by PwC and EY”.Britain’s accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, has already begun an investigation into EY’s audit of Thomas Cook’s accounts.Commenting on its past dual role at Thomas Cook, PwC said: “The non-audit work as advisers to the remuneration committee, which ceased in 2009, was approved in advance by the audit committee, complied with all relevant regulatory standards, and was disclosed in the company’s annual reports.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671f02abb30b668ce0a68e9c087e617149804ba6/0_14_1228_737/master/1228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c232b394caffb63023689d4447f5350","title":"tobacco firms accused of using gimmicks to subvert plain packaging","story":"Philip Morris has used ‘pro-seal’ and bevels to make packs more recognisable, says reportTobacco companies have been accused of undermining plain packaging laws by introducing gimmicks that ensure their cigarettes stand out from rival products but do not breach regulations.A report in the British Medical Journal’s BMJ Open publication found that global tobacco companies adopted subtle marketing techniques to replace traditional cigarette branding, which was banned in the UK in 2016.One of the MPs who pioneered the legislation said ministers should consider tightening up the law to eliminate loopholes detailed in the report, written by academics at the University of Bath.Researchers found that tobacco companies initially ramped up production before a one-year “sell-through” period, during which retailers were allowed to keep selling their remaining branded packs. This had the effect of keeping the older packs on sale for as as long as possible, maximising brand exposure in the run-up to May 2017, when they could no longer be sold.In the meantime, they came up with innovative ways to make plain-packaged products distinctive. Philip Morris International redesigned its premium Marlboro range, adding bevelled edges and a new “pro-seal” closing mechanism to packets, the researchers found. This made packs “appear more premium and recognisable compared to other brands”, the researchers claimed.The report also pointed to the terms introduced by tobacco companies to describe the filters on their cigarettes, such as “advanced” or “firm”. The researchers said previous studies suggested that such differentiating features “perpetuate the perceptions that some tobacco brand variants are less harmful than others”.“Given that the tobacco industry is attempting to circumvent standardised packaging legislation, other countries considering the policy should consider how to make regulations as comprehensive as possible to prevent the exploitation of continued marketing opportunities,” the report concluded.Tobacco companies have also responded to a ban on taste descriptions, such as “menthol” or “smooth”, by replacing them with names based on colour. Researchers said that banning terms such as “smooth” and “light” was meant to dispel the myth that certain types of cigarette are less dangerous, but that by teaching customers colour codes linked to the old descriptions, “misperceptions are likely to endure”.Another tactic used by the industry was to introduce flavour capsules previously reserved for the most expensive cigarettes into less costly products. The researchers said flavoured cigarettes were more likely to appeal to less regular smokers and young people.The Labour MP Alex Cunningham, who was one of the key proponents of plain packaging laws, said: “No one should be surprised at the tobacco companies doing everything possible to protect their brands, undermine the law and grow their sales. Ministers must act to put an end to this practice.The report’s lead author, Dr Karen Evans-Reeves, said the tobacco industry was “engaged in activities that undermined and continue to undermine the legislation”.“Major tobacco companies will always try to find a way to market their products,” she said. “Based on the number of innovations we found in this study, we would encourage all governments considering implementing plain packaging legislation to consider how tobacco companies have adapted to the legislation in other countries and where possible, close any remaining loopholes.”Philip Morris International, which owns Marlboro, did not respond to requests for comment.  previously revealed that the company produced Marlboro-branded metal tins in the run-up to the plain packaging legislation coming into force. The move was criticised as a ploy to prolong the visibility of Marlboro’s brand in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

We Brits owe all our European friends a sincere apology, a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance of Hamlet. For Britain is now Hamlet, forever agonising over whether Brexit is to be or not to be.So I can perfectly understand why Europeans such as French president Emmanuel Macron just want to be shot of us, so as to push ahead with an important, ambitious agenda for the whole European Union. Nonetheless, it remains in Europe’s own enlightened, long-term interest to go the extra kilometre. This means, concretely, that if the British parliament does not approve Boris Johnson’s new deal this week, the EU should offer an article 50 extension, as formally requested in the letter sent (though childishly not signed) by Johnson.I offer four arguments for this, all made from the point of view of the EU and Europe as a whole. First, a no-deal Brexit would be hugely damaging to Ireland and other parts of Europe geographically close to the UK. The amendment proposed by the independent Conservative Oliver Letwin and passed by parliament on Saturday is intended, above all, to preclude no deal. Letwin himself has said he will vote for Johnson’s deal, if it comes through parliament in the correct legal form and subject to proper scrutiny.Second, there is the question of who takes the blame. We know from a leaked document that the Johnson team of hard Brexiteers were preparing to blame any failure to get a deal on the “crazy” intransigence of Brussels. If, however, Macron were to make an unholy alliance with Johnson to push Britain out of the door on 31 October, then my side of the Brexit argument – the 3R side: for referendum, remain and reform – would be bound to place part of the blame on our European partners. At the moment, the EU has got itself in exactly the right position: it has showed sufficient firmness to defend the interests of Ireland and the single market, and sufficient flexibility to make any accusation of a punitive “Versailles” treaty completely implausible. For example, the EU breached its own red lines in reopening the withdrawal agreement, to make possible the new deal. It’s important that the EU stays in this sweet spot.Third, it would be better for the long-term future of Europe if the UK stayed in the EU. There is no good outcome to Brexit, but the least worst way forward is for Britain to vote in a second referendum to remain. And the best way to achieve that is for parliament to vote for Johnson’s deal but subject to a confirmatory referendum in which the British public would be asked to make a binding, final decision on a single, clear question: do you want Britain to leave the EU on the terms negotiated by this government, or do you want it to stay in the EU? To be or not to be.Since this government is dominated by hard Brexiteers – and what is envisaged in the new deal is a hard Brexit for England, Wales and Scotland, with a softer one only for Northern Ireland – no leave voter could plausibly complain they were only being offered the choice between a flaccid Brino (Brexit in Name Only) and staying in the EU. Hundreds of thousands rallied outside parliament on Saturday to show their support for such a people’s vote. Even more important than the activists are the opinion polls that now persistently show a majority for remain. How absurd it would be if the UK was to leave the EU, in the name of respecting “the will of the people”, at precisely the moment when the will of the people had changed.I know that many continental European friends who were once sympathetic to a second referendum now think the EU would be better off without us. But if Britain leaves now, it will take another five years to work out what the new economic relationship with the EU will be and whether Scotland will leave the United Kingdom, and then a further five years to see how all this beds down in practice. By that time, the EU and what is left of the UK will certainly have erged. Britain will be worse off economically than it might have been, but probably not so badly off that stubborn English voters, in particular, would swiftly choose to return. If Brexit goes badly for the UK, that will ensure a thoroughly unhappy and bad-tempered relationship across the Channel, negatively affecting the vital cooperation on foreign and security policy.If, against the odds, Brexit goes well for Britannia, then nationalist populists like Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, the Italian Matteo Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen will start to say, in those immortal words from the movie When Harry Met Sally: “I’ll have what she’s having.” Either way, it’s bad for the European Union.And there’s a fourth argument that should clinch the case. At the moment, Europe is the last best hope of a values-based west, standing up for democracy and the rule of law. Confronted with the demolition of liberal democracy in EU member states such as Hungary, this is one of the most important tasks for the next chapter of EU history, with new leadership in all European institutions, a freshly elected European parliament and a seven-year budget to be agreed.Prominent among the European leaders crowding round to congratulate Johnson after the deal was done last week was Orbán – he and Johnson are brothers under the skin. Johnson’s schoolboy manoeuvre of sending an unsigned, photocopied letter requesting an extension (as mandated by the so-called Benn act), together with a signed one encouraging the EU to refuse that request, shows just how contemptuous he is of a law passed by Britain’s sovereign parliament. Although his lawyers probably ensured that his conduct did not violate the letter of the law, it certainly violated the spirit of the law.Fortunately, the checks and balances of British liberal democracy are working. In a magnificent, muscular verdict, the supreme court found that Johnson acted unlawfully in trying to prorogue parliament for five weeks. And on Saturday, a democratically elected parliament once again took back control from a bullying executive, to ensure proper scrutiny of a hastily made deal which has epochal implications for both Britain and Europe. Whether this ends with a confirmatory referendum, as I hope, or with a general election, which seems more likely – or with parliament narrowly approving Johnson’s deal, which I would lament but accept – it will be a lawful, democratic process. And a lawful, democratic process is something Europe should always support, even if it takes a little longer.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and  columnist.

For readers it is felt when the fresh edition arrives, and is quiet until the next one. But for those who produce the publication, the beat is incessant. To help convey to readers something of the pulse rate inside a major journalism organisation, I asked two editors to describe their typical week, day by day.Melissa Denes edits Weekend, the magazine accompanying your Saturday , and Harriet Green edits the Observer Magazine, which arrives with that paper on Sundays. As they gave me their finished accounts, both independently remarked on how exhausting it was to think about and chronicle all their weekly processes.The two magazines are produced by separate teams, but their operations are sufficiently similar for the editors’ descriptions to be blended here for brevity. My aim is to give readers an appreciation of the disciplined planning, attuned creativity and sustained endeavour required to produce magazines of such consistent quality. In what follows, bear in mind that the editors need to have eyes for both the printed and digital versions, which inhabit very different reading and advertising environments.While you are reading a newly published magazine, the editors are monitoring responses to it on social media, reacting to queries, making tweaks online and assessing their competitors’ offerings. Already their next issue is deep in preparation, with the next two or three or more under way. They have a rough idea of covers for the next two or three months – recognising, always, that news is dynamic so they have to be agile.The combinations of content in each issue receive careful thought. Denes aims to give readers “a satisfying mix” including great writing, strong covers, “lifestyle content that is useful and relevant”, and surprises. For Green “a typical shape is a celebrity interview, a more chewy reported piece – the rise of vaping, perhaps – plus something first person or zeitgeisty”, and then the regular columns covering food, gardens, travel, beauty, relationship advice and more.Both editors are involved in details, especially covers. Early in her week Denes is “reading through all the pages ... unpicking any clashes, getting back to editors, writers, designers if I think something needs more work – a better picture, a stronger headline, another edit”.Denes: “For our cover story on the new season of The Crown, we had few images from behind the scenes and no shoot with Olivia Colman – so commissioned a classic red first-class stamp with a Queen Colman turning to face the reader. Often restrictions like this produce our best or most creative work.”As deadlines approach and the week’s production pace picks up, the editors have to step into other rhythms too: meetings with advertising and sales, marketing, legal discussion with other section editors listening to writers and perhaps “looking at different inks” which the design team has been testing.Close to going to press – production requirements mean this is days before the papers which will contain the magazines – proofs need to be read, headlines finessed and promotion considered. Then it’s done. The finished issues arrive in the office and it is time to “start worrying about the next one”.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232d32b6c7f255ee3336b1769cad0ae4906a7895/0_1700_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74330b6cf7ba864d0300d0f33426ad74","title":"amrou al kadhi being a drag queen healed me","story":"Growing up in a strict Muslim family, Amrou Al-Kadhi felt worthless, but found a new freedom and community in the world of dragI am a therapist couch hopper (sorry to any of my cuckolded shrinks now reading this). I’ve sampled mental health services like a toddler at a pick-n-mix stall, all in the hope of remedying the severe psychological issues that developed during my childhood.Here’s a taster. I’ve had cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to manage my once debilitating OCD, a condition that began when I was very young. In accordance with Islamic practice, I was taught to count my sins on my left shoulder (wanking over Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic  infinity sin points), and to ensure they didn’t exceed the good deeds I had to count on my right. And I became obsessed with counting.I’ve been in psychodynamic psychotherapy to help overcome my pathological struggle to form intimate relationships, which have all been shadowed by my childhood fears that the very nature of who I am would lead to rejection (from Allah, my parents and society). I’ve even attempted bioacoustic therapy, where sound frequencies are used to interfere with neural pathways conditioned by traumatic memories, in a bid to circumvent them and encourage positive thought-processes. And while each has had significant merits, none has been as therapeutic as the reparative art of drag. Of all things, the unadulterated joy of being a drag queen has healed me in ways I could have never envisioned.Drag fulfils many of the aims of CBT. The therapy involves weakening entrenched negative thought patterns and replacing them with more self-reparative ones. For instance, my compulsive behaviours germinate from a core belief that I am worthless. I carry this feeling everywhere I go. It generated when I was very young and petrified about the prospect of going to hell (not in a metaphorical sense – I believed quite literally that an eternity in blazing flames and torture awaited me in the afterlife). And being raised in a family where any kind of sexual or gender transgression was fiercely prohibited led to the unshakable belief that I was wrong inside.In drag, you live out a fantasy that directly contradicts the reality of your core beliefs. I was 20 when I created my drag alter-ego Glamrou, and an undergraduate when my OCD was at its worst. I couldn’t sleep without wedging open my laptop with a book that was pressing down on the letter Z of the keyboard. I re-lived every conversation I had straight after it was over, convinced I’d offended the other person. Whenever a friend took more than five minutes to respond to a text, I interpreted it as a sure sign they were rejecting me. A simple walk down the street sparked paranoia that even the traffic cones were disapproving of me.And so, what a surprise it was to experience pure majesty when in drag and on stage for the first time. For all my life being effeminate had led to bullying, shame, embarrassment and even violence, but in drag my femininity became a weapon. Drag empties out any notion of a queer person as “weak”. In drag, you create the rules. Deeply held feelings that I was a sinner became silenced by the power of standing proudly under a spotlight, my sequin dress producing a heavenly aura. Instead of punishment, who I was elicited validation and support from the audience.Drag mirrors the key philosophy of CBT therapy here: the repeated act of manifesting positive beliefs starts to unshackle the negative ones that tied me down. A decade of performing to audiences in the guise of a Middle Eastern goddess has taken me from fears of burning to rejoicing in the knowledge that I’m a girl on fire.With psychodynamic therapy, the relationship you build with your psychotherapist is critical. It is used as a map with which to investigate how you relate to everyone else in your life. I saw my psychotherapist almost every week for four years, during which I learned just how much my fear of rejection was interrupting the way I related to others. As a child, I held the sincere belief that hiding who I was inside would be the only way in which to keep people around.My parents, in an attempt to police my queer identity, employed strategies such as throwing away any camp clothes I purchased, telling me that I “was the source of their life’s unhappiness” and, after asking my mother whether she’d ever meet a hypothetical boyfriend, saying “it would be unfair of me to inflict myself on anyone” because I was “impossible to love”.Every relationship since has thus felt like an exhausting juggling act in which I work ferociously to stop others learning the truth of who I am. Like the Wizard of Oz, I hid behind a curtain while projecting something entirely different to the outside world.While psychodynamic psychotherapy has helped me understand and move past these behaviours, drag has been like a revolt against them. For an art form so artificial, drag is one of the most honest of performance mediums. You have to mine your depths and expel your guts on stage. Unapologetically, you take up space and demand that the room takes in all of who you are, and bows down to your every stitch and sequin. You re-fashion your face, body and clothes to force the world to accept you in the way you want to be seen. You combat the room with your darkest experiences, which you sublimate into humour and power.People responded to my drag the more honest I became on stage the act of expunging my transgressive thoughts and experiences in front of an audience led to more acceptance than I could have anticipated. Drag is like being out of the closet for a living – and when an audience celebrates you for this, it teaches you that you are worthy of love because of who you are, not in spite of it. It’s unsurprising, then, that my most special relationships are with other drag performers, who have offered me the kind of family I yearned for growing up.Bioacoustic therapy has certainly calmed my badly wired neurological pathways. For most of my life, my fight or flight response was initiated every 10 minutes, with every instance of possible rejection or failure, including traffic lights going red, acting as a trigger for my anxiety.Early in my 20s, anything to do with the Middle East catalysed these defence mechanisms. The parental response to my sexual and gender identity, as well as my childhood fear of Allah’s fiery wrath, meant that it was hard for me to be around Arabic speakers, or to engage with my cultural heritage. A few lines in Arabic could leave me sweating and unnerved.Drag was the unlikely route to me embracing my heritage. Five years ago I met an extraordinary Arab woman and fashion stylist who, as well as becoming a dear friend, also styled me for my drag troupe’s first music video. She encouraged me to look back to the costumes and styles of Middle Eastern female pop stars, and I’ve since learned to weave together my queer gender expression with the fabrics, textures and colours from my past.And in a weird twist of fate, drag has returned me to the person I thought it was helping me run away from – my beautiful Iraqi-Egyptian mother. I now regularly paint pictures of her on to my face – and instead of clamming up with dread at the sound of Arabic, I feel a sense of hope, and a strange wonder that drag has been the glue to tie all the fractured pieces of my identity together.Queer people from conservative backgrounds are working harder than you know to stay afloat every day. We’re trying to convince both ourselves and everybody else that we’re worth something, while constantly being told that we’re not. We try to stay positive and hopeful while facing perpetual violence. And we try to find acceptance and love when our experience has taught us only rejection. So it’s no wonder that many of us suffer a plethora of mental health issues. I’m grateful to all the therapists who have helped me work through mine and to drag, for teaching me something I should have learned a long time ago: there’s nothing wrong with me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03f83d52f4ce1a95a00eb2b2d41debdcf9efb72/0_18_1216_730/master/1216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f8b116adb1844ec74cb584f1970e6b","title":"10 unmissable experiences in nova scotia","story":"Whether it’s visiting wine country by doubledecker bus, rafting on a tidal bore or tucking into a lobster feast, there are memories to be made in Nova ScotiaNova Scotia is the kind of place where strangers stop to talk and smiles come easy. It’s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there’s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations.Line up a lobsterWhether it’s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the Shore Club, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer.Take in colourful LunenburgThe charming seaside town, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It’s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It’s also home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, as well as the Ironworks Distillery, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg’s history of rum running.Have a pre-breakfast surfThe secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it’s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at East Coast Surf School. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast.Sea kayaking in Cape LaHaveKayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at Cape LaHave Adventures. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner.The Rum Runners TrailDuring Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a 74-mile multi-use trail that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way.Alight at Peggy’s Cove Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at Peggy’s Cove is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home.Fossil hunt at Bay of FundyThe Bay of Fundy is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it’s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a tidal-bore rafting adventure. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride.On the Halifax waterfrontHalifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers’ markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like the Five Fishermen, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at Stayner’s Wharf Pub and Grill, or at the iconic Lower Deck, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city.Explore the coastlineWherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by. The province has more than 8,200 miles of pristine coastline, including the many islands that dot the coast, and there are beaches to suit everyone’s taste. Think white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, rocky, mist-laden shores with rolling waves or swimming and relaxing at the warm water beaches of Northumberland Shore. If you fancy surfing, Lawrencetown beach is a favourite, with its sand and cobblestone beach and big waves, just half an hour from the city centre. Crystal Crescent, just 40 minutes south of the city, is an expansive crescent-shaped beach, backed by a gorgeous 12-mile coastal hiking trail.Enjoy the east-coast hospitality and explore Halifax with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/802b0af9072b1462ff17c429d4e0fd6085042619/0_81_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?width=127\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4fed535eb015553baf2da990962b8fc 127w","title":"we have the best hole in the walls the insider guide to edmonton","story":"Hometown devotee Jen Mallia chats with city ambassador Linda Hoang and photographer extraordinaire Emilie Iggiotti for the inside scoop on Edmonton, Alberta’s buzzing capitalEdmonton boasts an arts scene that won’t quit and a banging array of places to eat and drink, plus opportunities to commune with nature, shop indie boutiques or visit the largest mall on the continent. It’s a welcoming city on the prairies of roughly a million people – a home for artists, tradespeople, academics, government workers, and people from around the world. Edmonton is the place you didn’t know you belonged!Another way to enjoy the mix of the urban and provincial in Edmonton is at one of the farmers’ markets. Many of them are outdoor, and therefore seasonal, but a select few operate year-round indoors. The Downtown Farmers’ Market is an indoor-outdoor hybrid. During the winter months, the market takes over one of downtown’s historic buildings, and in the warmer months it takes to the streets.During the summer months, the outdoor markets shift around the city, and you’ll find local gems around Edmonton’s inner neighbourhoods on both Saturdays and Sundays from June through to Canadian Thanksgiving in mid-October, when vendors up stalls and shift indoors. (Insider tip: don’t miss Moonshine Doughnuts at Old Strathcona Farmers’ Market – vegan and delicious!)Edmonton is nicknamed Festival City for a reason – you won’t get too far without happening upon a celebration. If a person likes something, Edmonton has a festival for it … from ice to cats! One of the most popular is the Edmonton international fringe theatre festival, held in venues centred in the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Every year at the end of August, performers from around the world contribute their work. Attendees can see a show at almost any time of the day or night, then hang out in the beer garden, trading critiques on the performances that range from the ridiculous to the sublime.Trendy Whyte Avenue is the backbone of the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Take time to poke through the shops, restaurants, and bars that line the avenue and surrounding blocks. Don’t miss brunch at Pip, or satisfy your sweet tooth at La Boule or Sugared \u0026amp Spiced. A soft serve ice-cream from Yelo’d is the perfect accompaniment to a sunny day. Venture a bit to the southeast to check out the new Ritchie Market – notably for Transcend Coffee or something stronger from Blind Enthusiasm brewery. Their craft beers pair well with the bites from adjacent Biera.Just like Fringe, Rust Magic is an annual festival that features the work of local and international artists. But Instead of treading the boards, these artists are spray-painting them. Each year since 2016, 15 new murals have been created and bequeathed to the city. Plans are in the works for guided tours of the street art during the festival, and maps are readily available at local businesses for self-guided exploration. Periodically throughout the year, Hoang herself runs Photo Walks featuring Instagrammable Walls of Edmonton, which are a great way to see some city colour and get some superb pics to take home too.Before Alberta developed its oil and gas industry, it was straight-up farming and ranch country. Calling back to the area’s agricultural heritage, high-calibre restaurants are cropping up all over town, with chefs focusing on innovative ways to use locally grown and sourced ingredients. A great way to sample a variety of these restaurants is with a culinary tour from Eat or Alberta Food Tours you can also pedal between nibbles and drinks with Food Bike Tours or the big bikes from Urban Pedal.You won’t go hungry in any area of the city, but a high concentration of foodie favourites are found downtown and in the Ice District. Try the vegan pizzas at Die Pie, Italian to die for at Uccellino, wood-fired creations at Woodwork, or share some plates at Bundok or Baijiu.West of downtown has experienced a hip revival in recent years. In addition to arty new shops, there are tons of places to eat. Start at Wilfred’s in the Brewery District, then swing by the Oliver Exchange Building, full of great places to grab a bite or a drink. Come hungry to enjoy Canadian cuisine at RGE RD on 123rd Street NW. A short walk to the north-east brings you to the fresh and French Café Linnea. If you still have room after that, locals swear by the treats at Duchess Bake Shop and the vegan cookies at Bloom Cookie Co.Before heading off, make sure to toast your time in the city. There are ample opportunities to enjoy a pint or two. To curate the experience, try a brewery tour from Alberta Craft Tours or Urban Pedal. If you are going it on your own, make sure Sea Change, Strathcona Spirits, Town Square, and the newly opened Polar Park are on your list. Make time for an inventive cocktail at the cosy Bar Clementine or chic Partake. For something a little different, try to score tickets on Eventbrite for one of the seasonal Street Car Cask events hosted by the Common.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

First-time film-makers frequently face an uphill battle getting noticed amid the noise and the circus of a film festival, and even more of a challenge securing distribution. Punters can be reluctant to take a risk on an unknown quantity in a festival schedule – on a director whose name isn’t instantly recognisable and whose CV contains perhaps only a couple of short films. But in fact, first features are often the most exciting films in a programme. Rather than coasting into a screening slot on the strength of a director’s past successes, first features are chosen on merit. To be selected, a debut has to deliver something accomplished and memorable – it has to be a forceful statement of intent.If the stars align, a successful festival launch can lead to a film that woos both critics and audiences, providing a career springboard for the director and actors while also doing good business at the box office. Recent examples include Benh Zeitlin’s Beasts of the Southern Wild, which launched in Cannes 2012 and went on to earn four Oscar nominations Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook and Jordan Peele’s Get Out, first features that premiered to acclaim in Sundance 2014 and 2017 respectively and led to Peele winning an Oscar and Lady Macbeth (Toronto, 2016), which introduced the incomparable Florence Pugh to the movie world.It has been a particularly rich year for buzzy debuts breaking out at film festivals around the world. The trend started at Sundance, with Joe Talbot’s The Last Black Man in San Francisco claiming both a directing prize and the special jury prize. At Cannes a few months later, two first features claimed slots in the main competition: Ladj Ly’s propulsive Parisian crime drama Les Misérables won the jury prize and went on to earn France’s submission in the best foreign language Oscar category. Meanwhile Atlantics, a dreamy blend of supernatural drama and real-world commentary by actor and director Mati Diop, won the grand jury prize at Cannes and is the Senegalese Oscar submission.In the vast Toronto film festival programme, it’s easy for the smaller films to get lost, but two British directors made their mark. Rose Glass’s horror Saint Maud was a hit in the festival’s popular Midnight Madness strand, while Nick Rowland’s Ireland-set Calm With Horses established Rowland as a director to watch and lead Cosmo Jarvis (last seen in Lady Macbeth) as a star in the making. Toronto also premiered Sound of Metal, the fiction feature debut from Darius Marder which stars Riz Ahmed as a deaf rock drummer.There’s something particularly thrilling about discovering a stand-out first film at a festival – a sense that you are witnessing the beginning of a career that could go on to shape cinema for years to come. And on the strength of this year’s crop, the future of film is in good hands.“When he’s pleased, it’s like a shiver, or sometimes a pulsing,” swoons private carer Maud of her relationship with God, in Rose Glass’s tense, drily funny horror, Saint Maud. Maud assists a dying dancer played by Jennifer Ehle, all the while contemplating her own spiritual rebirth. “As soon as I started writing stories myself, they always tended to have slightly hallucinatory, sensual elements,” says the movie’s 30-year-old writer‑director. Glass’s graduation film, Room 55, featured an uptight TV cook who experiences an epiphany while tied up in Japanese rope bondage.Since its world premiere at the Toronto film festival last month (where it was snapped up by trendy US distributor A24 Films), Saint Maud has bewitched audiences and industry luminaries alike. Last Sunday at the closing night of London film festival, where it was in the main competition, the jury president, director Wash Westmoreland, said: “This dazzling directorial debut marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in British cinema.” A week before, when presenting Glass with the IWC Schaffhausen film-maker bursary – which promises £50,000 of development funding to an early career film-maker – Danny Boyle described her as an “extraordinary talent” and said that the film’s “confidence evokes the ecstasy of films like Carrie, The Exorcist and Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin”.Born near Chelmsford, Essex, Glass studied film and video at the London College of Communication, later graduating from the National Film and Television School in 2014 with a master’s in directing. The film-maker describes her younger self as an “awkward, anxious teen” who would “always try and look up weird violent films and order them off the internet, video nasties, stuff like that”. Darren Aronofsky’s twisted psychological thriller Pi was an early obsession a VHS of David Lynch’s Eraserhead – a gift from her father – gave her a taste for on-screen viscera.Saint Maud cleverly dances the knife-edge between horror and comedy, and Glass uses her jump scares judiciously. The director’s eyes gleam as she recounts a rumour that at a recent screening an audience member was given such a fright that they “whacked their elbow so hard they broke it and had to have surgery”.Alternately devoted and sneering, Maud is an unreliable and darkly hilarious narrator brilliantly brought to life by Welsh actor Morfydd Clark, who has appeared in Carol Morley’s The Falling and Whit Stillman’s Love \u0026amp Friendship, as well as Armando Ianucci’s forthcoming The Personal History of David Copperfield. Glass says her early pitches imagined the character as “Travis Bickle, if he was a young Catholic woman living in an English seaside town”. She adds: “You never really know what could happen when someone feels alienated and isn’t able to connect with humans around them. I’m interested in the things that people turn to to try and make sense of the world around them. I don’t think any other medium quite has the capacity to put you in someone else’s head as much as film.”Describe your film-making in three words…Strange, sensual and silly.What’s a film that’s really made an impact on you recently?Jennifer Reeder’s Knives and Skin – it’s like if John Waters directed a David Lynch movie. Trashy, smart and hilarious.What one thing can’t you live without on set?Cigarettes.Saint Maud will be released next yearSpurred on by their “collective depression” about these changes, the pair decided to create a film. The result, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, is a gorgeous, sprawling love letter to a Victorian townhouse in the city’s historic and rapidly transforming Fillmore district. Talbot writes and directs, while the story is based on the experiences of Fails, who also stars as a fictionalised version of himself trying, with friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), to reclaim a house that may or may not have been built by Fails’s grandfather. Shot on location, Talbot says the film “accidentally became the project of archiving the city, because a lot of those places don’t exist any more”. It was a huge hit at Sundance in January, where it won two awards, including best director, and has since received rave reviews. In June, Rolling Stone called it one of the best movies of the year.Talbot had an unconventional path into film-making. He attended the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts, but was, by his own admission, “kind of a nuisance”, and so dropped out. “I grew up in a family of journalists and writers who loved movies, so when we weren’t discussing politics at the dinner table, we were talking about movies and music,” he says. His interest in film-making was inspired by an uncle he describes as “the family documentarian”, whose camera he used to borrow.Talbot’s debut takes a poetic, emotional approach to the problem of gentrification, which is perhaps why the film is resonating so widely. “Gentrification is often discussed as statistics, but it’s smells, it’s people that used to sit on their stoops, it’s neighbourhood characters, it’s buildings you loved that were part of your upbringing that are gutted,” he says. “We wanted the movie to feel like it was out of Jimmie’s heart.”Do you have a role model?Hal Ashby is someone I look to. It’s the empathy his films have for their characters – even the mean ones are treated with love.Who would be your dream actor to work with?Joaquin Phoenix.What one thing can’t you live without on set?My Giants hat. SHThe Last Black Man in San Francisco is released on FridayCalm With Horses, the first feature from Nick Rowland, is a blistering debut. The film, which was executive produced by Michael Fassbender, gives a vivid account of a fateful chapter in the life of a slow-witted heavy called Arm (a revelatory performance from Cosmo Jarvis). He must juggle his allegiance to a toxic criminal family that has embraced him as one of their own against his responsibilities to his ex-girlfriend and their autistic son.The film balances a small-town Ireland setting against big themes, crackling humour against aching pathos and casual violence against an empathetic core. Rowland’s work with actors – Jarvis co-stars with Barry Keoghan and Niamh Algar, both excellent – is first rate the level of film-making craft, particularly in the use of sound, is superb. It feels like the work of a director who was born to make movies.But in fact, Rowland’s route into cinema was circuitous. Film school came after he had already spent several years as a professional rally driver racing in the Chinese Rally Championship and the British Rally Championship. “I think I must be the only person ever to tell their mother ‘I want to be a film director’ and for her to be relieved because it was a less risky option than what I was already doing,” he says.Rowland followed his rally career with a stint as a tour guide in an aquarium (a low point was having to dress as Neptune for World Oceans Day) and lived with his mother, who had moved from the Midlands, where Rowland grew up, to Banff in Scotland. “Because I was away from my friends, I watched lots of movies. And that was the first time I engaged with film properly.” At a career crossroads, Rowland idly took an online multiple choice quiz which suggested that he should be a librarian or a film-maker. He picked the latter and in 2015 graduated from the National Film and Television School.It was when he was developing another screenplay that he stumbled on a collection of writing by Colin Barrett, which contained the short story Calm With Horses. “I am dyslexic. I find reading really hard,” says Rowland. “But I read the whole collection in an afternoon, which is rare for me. And it was quite an instant reaction that this would make a good film. This contrast of a criminal world and a melancholy emotional heart. It felt really fresh.”Why film?I think film is the best way to build empathy. I am very emotionally driven and go to the cinema to feel things. To feel what it is like to be someone else.What one thing can’t you live without on set?Hand sanitiser. Lots of hand sanitiser.In Mati Diop’s eerie, atmospheric first feature, Atlantics, the ocean appears as an ominous presence, deceptively sparkling and calm. The French-Senegalese director first turned her camera on migrants’ dangerous boat journeys to Europe in her 2009 documentary short, Atlantiques. This time, however, she has turned her attention back towards the shore, to the women left behind the story of Penelope, not Odysseus.“I wanted to tell the story from a feminine point of view,” Diop says, when we meet ahead of the UK premiere at the London film festival, where it went on to win best first feature. “It was not a theoretical feminist approach – it was more personal.” While visiting her family in Dakar, aged 25, after a 10-year absence, she was struck by the number of young people ready to risk their lives at sea. She knew she wanted to tell their story, but didn’t want her film to follow them into the boat: “It’s not my place, I don’t have a right to be there.”Earlier in the year, Diop made headlines as the first black female director to compete for the Palme d’Or at Cannes in the festival’s 72-year history. Today, she politely but firmly moves the conversation on: “It was understandable that it took a lot of space at the time, but now that everybody knows, I think it shouldn’t be a subject any more.” The film won the Grand Prix, the festival’s second most prestigious prize, then last month, at the Toronto film festival, Diop received the inaugural Mary Pickford award recognising outstanding female talent. There, the festival’s artistic director, Cameron Bailey, said: “Atlantics is a profound and unsettling work of art. We know this is just the start for such an original and authentic voice.” Now the film has been selected as the Senegalese entry for next year’s Academy Awards. The reception in Senegal, says Diop, has been “very, very positive – people recognised themselves”.The Paris-based director, 37, has been making films since 2004. The niece of Senegalese film-maker Djibril Diop Mambéty, for her 2013 documentary, A Thousand Suns, Diop tracked down the lead actor from Mambéty’s 1973 film Touki Bouki. Diop herself has worked as an actor, starring in films including Simon Killer (2012, opposite Brady Corbet) and Claire Denis’s 35 Shots of Rum (2008). Over the years, Denis has become something of a mentor her influence permeates Diop’s sensual, sensorial shots.Atlantics is a moving take on the refugee crisis. It is a ghost love story focusing on 17-year-old Ada (Mama Bineta Sané), promised to a wealthy man but in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré), who attempts a fateful journey to Spain when the boat goes missing, supernatural events envelop the city. “The ghost dimension was inherent in the situation,” says Diop. “We’re talking about a generation that has disappeared, and that necessarily haunts the living.” The romance between Ada and Souleiman was just as important. “I really wanted to tell a love story. I felt that through this story, it could really become universal, mythical.”Who would be your dream actor to work with?I don’t know him yet. My ideal actor to shoot is somebody I’ve never seen before.Do you have a role model?Jordan Peele – he’s a genius and has an incredible political vision.Atlantics will be in selected cinemas and on Netflix on 29 November This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

With the home side targeting City’s right full-back Gemma Bonner, drafted in to replace Aoife Mannion, who ruptured an ACL in the draw against Atlético Madrid on Wednesday in the Champions League, they had an almost instant impact.With Leah Galton, arguably United’s player of the season, receiving a long ball over the top of her wide on the left she and Bonner went shoulder to shoulder. The defender got a touch but could only play it back into the path of Galton, who powered into the box and cracked a shot which ricocheted off several City players. Hayley Ladd collected the loose ball but was scythed down on the edge of the box. It could have been a penalty but it did not matter because up stepped the captain, Katie Zelem, to score from the free-kick.She hit a looping, powerful shot into the far left corner past the fingertips of a ing Ellie Roebuck. “I’ll just try to be the best person I can be and the best captain I can be,” said the No 10 on asked if being a fan makes the badge and armband weigh more heavily.With both sides pressing hard, United continued to have success on the left, exploiting the gap between Bonner and the Canadian forward Janine Beckie. Stoney urged Galton to drop in and take advantage but Cushing pushed Jill Scott over to fill the hole.With that avenue closed off in the second half United switched their focus to the right. Jackie Groenen and Kirsty Hanson linked seamlessly to give Demi Stokes the slip before Hanson whipped a cross to the feet of Jess Sigsworth, who poked in from close range.City frustrations told in the 65th minute when Kiera Walsh’s mistimed tackle on Hanson earned a red card, ruling her out of the game with Arsenal next Sunday. Cushing had no complaints. “It was a strong tackle. I know Kiera well and I don’t think she went in intentionally to try and get the girl. In the modern game you can’t go in out of control.”City visit the WSL champions before they travel to Madrid for the return leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and, having lost and conceded goals in domestic competition for the first time this season, they will have to dust themselves off quickly.“I don’t see it as my job to pick them up,” said Cushing. “I see it as their job to pick themselves up. Look, if a defeat against Manchester United in a local derby doesn’t kick you up the arse then nothing will. When you’re a winning team it hurts because you don’t lose that often but you have to use that as fuel.”For Stoney, this win gives the United team belief in her strategy. “They sit in that changing room and their shoulders are a little bit higher, their chests are out a little bit more, they’ve got more belief in their psychology and they trust what we’re doing as staff now to deliver that gameplan, which they executed brilliantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d41158775d5fdd8acc6736b5b48d939818a5e0a/0_241_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce9298d695595050c53531bf7a1cbac","title":"manchester united liverpool premier league match report","story":"By any objective measure, this had felt like an away banker during what was a high-octane build-up. Manchester United, mired in their worst start to a season since 1989-90, had been goal-shy their confidence seemingly in pieces. Liverpool were supposed to roll up to Old Trafford and extend their 100 per cent Premier League to a record-equalling 18th game.Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the eternally optimistic United manager, had claimed that “this is the perfect game for us‚“ but, to put it bluntly, nobody believed him. Perhaps they should have done.It was a wild turn-around from a United point-of-view, a thumbing of the form-book and it said everything that Solskjær’s team, having taken a first-half lead through Marcus Rashford, could finish a little disappointed at having failed to inflict upon Liverpool a first league defeat since January.With only five minutes to play, Liverpool had looked out of ideas. The story looked set to be coloured by United’s bodies-on-the-line defensive defiance. But then Andrew Robertson crossed low from the left, Roberto Firmino’s presence in the centre was a distraction and there was the substitute, Adam Lallana, to tap home from point-blank range.It was the prompt for Liverpool to turn the screw and the five minutes of stoppage time would feel like an eternity for United. Another Liverpool substitute, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, fizzed inches wide but Solskjær’s team had not only done more than imagined, they had done enough.Liverpool remain undefeated and clear at the top of the table. Having trailed until so late, they could be happy with the draw, particularly as they struggled to prise United apart. The point spoke of their resilience. United and Solskjær will hope it can herald a new dawn.United had started the day in 14th place – one point above the relegation zone – and it felt as if every number, every statistic, was insulting them. Several bookmakers had them as long as 7-2 to beat opponents who Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City manager, described as looking “unstoppable”. Liverpool had last dropped league points in the 0-0 draw at Everton on 3 March.Desperate times called for radical measures and, for the first time this season, Solskjær started with a three-man defence, although even that plan needed a late fine-tune after Axel Tuanzebe was ruled out with an injury in the warm-up. In came Marcos Rojo on the left of the back three.United’s new-look contrasted sharply with Liverpool’s tried and trusted 4-3-3, although Jürgen Klopp missed Mohamed Salah because of an ankle injury. Solskjær’s idea was for his quick forwards, Daniel James and Rashford, to lead from the front in terms of their work rate and everybody behind them to follow. From the whistle, United brought a commitment that galvanised the home crowd.For both teams, it was all about winning the ball and transitioning as quickly as possible and this is how the United goal was created. The big question concerned whether Victor Lindelof had fouled Divock Origi when he got United moving midway inside their half. VAR would say no but it was mightily tight. Lindelof did nibble through Origi and it looked like a foul but was it clear and obvious enough to merit an over-rule of the on-pitch referee, Martin Atkinson?United were still some distance from goal yet when Scott McTominay released James, there was pace and possibility. James crossed low and, after deceiving Joël Matip with a clever piece of movement inside the area, Rashford prodded past Alisson, who had returned after a calf injury. Inside his technical area, Klopp raged at the fourth official, Jon Moss.The Liverpool manager’s mood would darken before the interval when his team had an equaliser chalked off by VAR. On viewing the replays, it was plain that Sadio Mané had used his hand to control a high ball before wriggling away from Lindelof to beat David de Gea, who had been the surprise inclusion in the United line-up after a muscular problem. The problem with VAR is that it does not warn the supporters of the team that has just scored. The Liverpool fans had erupted in delight. Their journey back down to earth came with a bump.United’s intensity was a feature of their performance they were determined to disrupt Liverpool’s rhythm and restrict them. They succeeded in the first-half because only once, when Mané cut back for Firmino on the counter, did the visitors truly threaten. Firmino picked out De Gea when he had Origi free to his left. Not that United had exactly pulled Liverpool apart. Their one first-half flicker before scoring saw McTominay drive forward and shoot weakly at Alisson.Klopp shuffled his pack in the second-half. At first, he moved Origi up front and then, when he replaced him with Oxlade-Chamberlain, he effectively went with a 4-2-4 formation. Firmino and Mané played centrally, with the latter sometimes dropping off, while Jordan Henderson and Oxlade-Chamberlain worked off the flanks. Klopp would send on Lallana for Henderson – another attacking move.The battle lines were drawn. United were happy to preserve what they had and possibly nick something on the break while Liverpool put everything into a front-foot search for the equaliser. The visitors’ frustration bubbled. Atkinson was a target for their fans, who felt that every 50-50 decision went against them, and even a United ball boy managed to anger Henderson by holding on to one stray ball for too long.United came to look like the likelier scorers of the next goal because for all of their possession, Liverpool could not create anything of clear-cut note. Rashford fizzed, James flickered and Fred went close. Liverpool, though, refused to lose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac08301822b2dc6a1df2c6aaf549c15b0dcc94d1/174_548_4523_2714/master/4523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1ba74fb9db2b57349a9b8c54ef8e637","title":"manchester united v liverpool premier league live","story":"Liverpool’s winning run came to an end in a scruffy game at Old Trafford, but Adam Lallana’s late equaliser put them six points clear at the top of the tableThat’s it for today’s blog. Thanks for your company and emails night.Jose Mourinho’s response to Klopp’s comments“He didn’t like the menu. He likes meat and he got fish. so he was not happy. They are of course much stronger against opponents who give them a chance of transitions and counter-attacks. United didn’t do that. And he didn’t like the menu.”“So, the result is now okay. It’s not what we wanted beforehand, obviously, but with the way the game developed we have to be happy with a point. The performance was … we had good moments in the second half. The first half I didn’t like. We gave Man United opportunities to do what they wanted to do – just being aggressive, making challenges everywhere. You have to pass through the lines. There were opportunities to do that but we didn’t see them. “In the second half we were better. We deserved a point, 100 per cent. It’s just a point. Since I’ve been in England, Man United have always played against us like this they defend with all they have. Everybody built this game up like a mountain, but one team only tries to defend and one has to … make the game. We’ll take the point – it’s much better than no points – but it’s not that we feel we’ve won something by scoring late today. It’s just a point, let’s carry on.”“I was listening on BBC World Service in France and following the MBM,” says Andrew Dobson. “Weirdly, you were always ahead of the radio. How does that happen?”If I tell you, I’ll have to kill you in two minutes’ time.Jordan Henderson “I delighted for Adam, because he’s worked so hard and he deserves that. He saved us today and that could be a big point come the end of the season. We could have been better – we know that – but if you can’t win, don’t lose. We were sloppy first half, not fluid enough it was quite scrappy. Second half I thought we caused them more problems, especially towards the end of the game, but we couldn’t find a winner.“I felt the referee gave a lot of similar free-kicks to them in the first half, and then he didn’t give one to us on their goal. But it’s no excuse, we’ve got to defend it better. Our performance level wasn’t up to our usual standards. We have to take the positives from the game and learn from the negatives.“The manager just asked me to make an impact when I came on. I thought Ox did extremely well when he came on. If we’re gonna win the league we’ll need a squad, not just an XI, and that’s what we can take out of today’s game. We weren’t at our best so it’s a point gained. “People were saying it would be an easy three points for us. That’s never the case, and form goes out the window in these games. It felt like we controlled the game in the second half. We’re still unbeaten so there are huge positives considering we didn’t play our best.” That’s it. Liverpool’s winning run ends at 17, one short of the record, but they will be happy enough after Adam Lallana’s late equaliser put them six points clear at the top. Although it was a scruffy game of few chances, there was always something going on and it was fascinating tactically. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer set United up expertly in the first half, with a 3-4-1-2 formation and split strikers, but they ran out of steam in the second. Solskjaer was arguably too passive with his substitutions, although he didn’t have many options. And while Liverpool were nowhere near their awesome best, they probably deserved a draw for their persistence and territorial dominance.There was VAR controversy, inevitably, and a soupçon of needle. United look deflated because of the late equaliser. When the dust settles, they will reflect on a pretty good day. Marcus Rashford on the talismanic side of immense, and there were plenty of signs that United are going in the right direction. In this case, admittedly, that means moving from 14th to 13th in the league, but fourth place is still a realistic ambition.No penalty! A cross from the right hit Fred on the shoulder, and they are still looking at it. It’s been cleared, but Liverpool have a corner.90+6 min: VAR check for a Liverpool penalty!90+5 min Oxlade-Chamberlain overhits a fairly straightforward crossfield pass to Alexander-Arnold, who would have been in on the right side of the area. 90+4 min Brandon Williams replaces Andreas Pereira for United.90+3 min Pereira’s corner is headed clear by Matip.90+3 min Now James wins a corner for United on the counter-attack. As much as it anything, it will buy them a bit of time.90+1 min Oxlade-Chamberlain, 25 yards from goal, cracks a superb daisy-cutter with his left foot that beats de Gea and goes this far wide of the post. 90 min United are out on their feet. There will be five minutes of added time.89 min If Liverpool win this, it will empower them beyond belief for the rest of the season. They have a bit of a swagger on for the first time all day.88 min A poor header from Lindelof goes straight to Alexander-Arnold, who swishes the bouncing ball just over the bar from the right side of the area. De Gea had it covered.87 min Liverpool have a great chance to nick this, because the place has gone really flat and United look tired.It was made by Robertson on the left. His low cross, not his best actually, was missed by Lindelof at the near post and ran through to Lallana, who tapped into an open net from four yards. Liverpool could yet make it 18 wins in a row!Adam Lallana has equalised for Liverpool!84 min The first Manchester United change: Anthony Martial replaces Marcus Rashford, who has been immense.83 min James charges down the left, ignores a rugby tackle from Matip and flashes a low ball across the face of goal. It’s recycled by Wan-Bissaka and then Fred, who whistles a left-footed shot just wide of the far post. I think Alisson had it covered.82 min Liverpool make their final change: Naby Keita for Gini Wijnaldum.81 min United have now moved to a 5-4-1 formation, with James on the left wing. I’m surprised Martial hasn’t come on, although I don’t suppose you can take Rashford off when he’s playing like this. 80 min “These two pub sides are giving it their all,” says Kevin Porter. “When does the Premier League match start?”79 min Oxlade-Chamberlain drifts out of play to huge cheers. Liverpool’s pass selection has been weirdly poor for most of the match.78 min “Fred and Pereira have been wonderful today,” says Manasvin. “an underrated part of what Pereira has done is the way he’s locked Fabinho up. You expect Fab to usually be heavily involved in Liverpool’s first stage build-up but he’s been closed off very well today. Props to Fred for covering spaces in midfield properly as well, he’s ensured that Wijnaldum doesn’t have the chance to twist and turn his way out like he did in the initial stages.”Agreed, especially about Pereira and Fabinho, who is such an underrated influence on Liverpool’s play.77 min Young is lucky not to be booked for a late tackle on Lallana, a point Virgil van Dijk makes in his ear before play restarts.75 min Liverpool have completely dominated possession in the second half, yet I don’t think de Gea has had a save to make. It’s been a very strange game.73 min If it stays like this, and that’s an appreciable if, it’ll complete a very, very good day for Manchester United.72 min Fred, on the left side of the box, slashes a half-volley well wide from 15 yards. It was a nice move from United involving Pereira, Rashford, Young and then Pereira again. 71 min Adam Lallana replaces Jordan Henderson. Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville on Sky are slating Liverpool’s performance, with Carragher suggesting there might be a “mental block” about playing at Old Trafford.71 min “He’s only gone and done it, hasn’t he?” says Simon McMahon. “Andy Murray won! He bloomin’ well won! A set and a break down, and he still won. He’s crying, I’m crying. He only had one hip nine months ago. Now he’s thanking his opponent and the crowd. I love him. No HawkeyeVAR drama either. I still love it, but football has a lot to learn.”70 min Fabinho is booked for a foul on the breaking James.67 min Rashford almost grabs a second on the break. Pereira found him on the left with a good crossfield pass, and he waited for James to make an off-the-ball run from centre to left. Rashford used James by not using him, cutting inside Matip before drilling a low shot just wide from 25 yards. Alisson had it covered but it was well struck.64 min Oxlade-Chamberlain drags a shot wide from 20 yards. It’s all Liverpool now, working the ball from side to side as they look for an opening. United, who started with such intensity, are starting to look slightly weary.63 min “I simply can’t believe you’re allowing your outrageous pro-United bias to show, even going as far as to report a 1-0 scoreline,” sniffs Matt Dony. “We all saw the build-up. It’s supposed to be a walk-over. Liverpool must be winning. Surely. #BakowskiIn.”62 min That tactical change from Solskjaer was a switch from 3-4-1-2 to 3-5-2, with Pereira moving a bit deeper. It’s been an interesting game tactically.61 min For the first time in the match, Liverpool are being allowed more time on the ball in deeper positions. Robertson’s low cross goes right across the face of goal before being cleared by Young. United can’t get out, and it might soon be time for Anthony Martial.60 min Liverpool bring on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Divock Origi. That looks like a switch to 4-4-2, with Oxlade-Chamberlain left and Mane and Firmino up front. James is okay to continue.59 min James is having a concussion test. The break in play allows Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the chance to give some tactical advice to Rashford. 57 min James is down again, having been whacked by Fabinho, but Liverpool play on. After about 40 seconds, Matip kicks the ball out of play and gets a minor rollocking from Jordan Henderson.56 min This is a good spell for Liverpool, their best of the match. Origi loses McTominay and hits a fierce shot that is blocked by Rojo. United have struggled to get out in the last few minutes.52 min Liverpool look slightly better since half-time, though it is still a very scruffy game. That suits United. Rashford, after a listless start, is having a minor stormer. 50 min James is flattened by a firm but fair tackle from van Dijk. He looks really groggy, although it’s not a head injury this time he’s been winded.49 min “In old money Mane’s goal would have stood,” says Niall Mullen. “In new money it was correctly disallowed. I hate new money.”48 min Liverpool have switched to a 4-2-3-1: Henderson right, Mane left and Firmino behind Origi.47 min Henderson’s grossly overhit cross is retrieved by the absurd Robertson, who keeps the ball in play Steve McMahon-style - okay, not quite as spectacularly as that - and then whips in a very good cross that is headed away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97c3f15c32357283157725a4c4629252779f0bf/213_0_5547_3328/master/5547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d76b9627896ab5aa23962d29f91ff173","title":"five ways to deal with head lice and nits","story":"Parents dread discovering an infestation of the itchy menaces, but with the right approach you can stop them in their tracksMany of Britain’s bestselling nit combs are ineffective, says Burgess: “They have gaps so wide that lice and nits can slip through.” He recommends using a plastic detection comb. “It needs to be rigid, and the front needs to be squared, to catch the legs of the lice.” The Bug Buster Kit sold by the charity Community Hygiene Concern contains these types of combs, with different sizes for lice and nits, and is available on the NHS (free for children diagnosed with lice). “It’s not going to be done in five minutes,” says Burgess. “With thick or long hair, you need to spend 20 to 30 minutes per session. If you’ve found a dozen and think you’ve done a good job, you probably haven’t – there’ll be at least another dozen hiding.”“Lice are movement-sensitive and scarper when you touch the hair,” warns Wright. Dividing the head into sections helps avoid missing any. Detangle the hair first and use conditioner. Metal combs, especially, can shred inidual hairs, says Burgess. “We have even come across pseudo nits, where the comb has peeled back little knots that look and feel like nits,” he says. “So if you’re going to comb, you need to use a lubricant and do it carefully.”Burgess says that we have known about pesticide-resistant lice in the UK since 1995, yet chemical pesticide treatments are still sold – and frequently recommended by pharmacists and prescribed by doctors. “GPs aren’t listening,” he says. “It’s hardly surprising there are a lot of lice.”Silicone-based shampoo treatments, otherwise known as physical pesticides, may effectively smother the lice, but some of the dreaded nits can survive. “We looked at nearly 1,895 case records,” says Burgess. “Most of those who had baby lice appear after a treatment had them within the first week, but the longest case was 13 days.” Either treat again a week or so later, or keep combing for a few weeks to catch any late hatchers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56dce77c74a5ab04200baf5e99b55333bb23d31e/0_213_665_399/master/665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9807571cd77b7188487f1fc1a39930af","title":"ring cycle berlin staatsoper barenboim ring master of our age","story":"The chance to see a complete Ring cycle is all too rare these days. Martin Kettle reports from Berlin’s Staatsoper, where Daniel Barenboim might be hidden from view, but his Wagner is revelatoryThere was a time when it was unusual for a season to pass in a British opera house without the complete Ring being performed. The first Ring cycle to be mounted in postwar Britain was premiered in 1949 at Covent Garden. Thereafter (with the sole exception of 1952), the Ring, or parts of it, was an annual fixture at the Royal Opera House for two decades. Finally there was a fallow year in 1969. By this time, however, Sadler’s Wells Opera (later English National Opera) was building its own cycle, sung in English. The Ring – or parts thereof – continued to be performed most seasons into the 1980s at both houses, with Welsh National Opera and Scottish Opera also mounting Rings and - just as significantly - touring them around Britain.Little of this period of plenty remains today. This is not to downplay some important recent Ring cycles, such as those put on by Opera North and Longborough festival, or the concert performances at the Proms and elsewhere, let alone the cycle directed by Keith Warner for Covent Garden in 2007 and revived in 2012 and 2018. But the gaps are increasingly large and obvious. Though there are many different causes for this change, the steady decline in Britain’s public subsidy to the opera sector is certainly one of the most decisive in making Wagner’s opera cycle an increasing and sometimes very expensive rarity on our stages. The result is that younger newcomers to the Ring are no longer able to get access to this most important and ambitious of 19th century European musical art works.Today, if you are British and want to see a Ring cycle, you must travel abroad. This might be far from easy and certainly far from cheap, but just as sports fans now routinely head overseas to watch their favourites, so an admittedly smaller number of Wagner lovers now make the journey to overseas Rings too. British visitors were much in evidence at in Berlin this autumn. It is likely that numbers will also be travelling to Paris’s Opéra-Bastille and Chicago’s Lyric Opera in 2020, where new Ring cycles are scheduled.The chief attraction of this autumn’s Berlin Ring was the chance to hear the finest Wagner conductor of the modern era performing the work in his company’s renovated theatre for the first time. Daniel Barenboim has been conducting the Ring half a lifetime. His Bayreuth festival cycle of 1988, directed by Harry Kupfer, established him as the Ring master of his generation. Several notable conductors honed their trade as his assistants, including Christian Thielemann, Antonio Pappano and Philippe Jordan. Now 76, Barenboim has been conducting Guy Cassiers’ production since 2010, both in Berlin and Milan (several in those casts there took part in Barenboim’s 2013 Proms cycle). Until now, however, he has not performed it as a cycle at the historic Berlin State Opera theatre on Unter den Linden, which reopened after an eight-year renovation in late 2017, and of which he is music director.Barenboim remains invisible, Bayreuth-style, in the Staatsoper pit throughout the four parts of the Ring. He takes his bow democratically surrounded by the entire Berlin Staatskapelle orchestra on the stage. But there is never any doubting his commanding grasp and leadership. Where other conductors maybe allow the dynamics to soar too loudly or the musical line to descend into generalities, Barenboim’s control is tight but flexible, and consistently full of contrast, while never losing the musical flow or drawing attention to itself. It is like hearing the work afresh.The result is a rich illumination of orchestral detail and layering that is too often blurred in other performances, and is particularly successful in Das Rheingold. Under Barenboim, scenes which in less skilful hands can be formulaic, like the opening scene of Rheingold or the closing duet in Siegfried, acquire new dramatic clarity, meaning the big moments in Götterdämmerung are reached with a sense of inevitability.The conductor’s art achieved its profoundest climax at the end of Die Walküre, where Barenboim masterly observed Wagner’s often ignored pianissimo markings in the orchestra as Wotan leaves Brünnhilde for the last time. The effect was to express Wotan’s despair, defeat and eclipse in passages of revelatory orchestral restraint, a lesson to all Wagner conductors.Cassiers’s production does not come close to matching Barenboim’s achievement. It is contemporary but also conservative. There is no old-school naturalism, but the treatment also eschews the radical conceptualising that is meat and drink to many European Ring cycles. There are no crashed aeroplanes or biting crocodiles, both of which have featured in recent Rings. The use of dancers intermittently seems to underline important cruxes in the narrative and can broaden the expressive scope, but it is often merely distracting and ultimately lacks conviction. The production represents a dimly lit reversion to the decluttered postwar “new Bayreuth” aesthetic, and at times this Ring is more like a semi-staged concert performance. This can, though, have advantages, since it keeps the focus on the musical drama. It is hard to remember a Ring that so effectively centres on the transition from Wotan’s corrupted world to Brünnhilde’s role as the world’s redeemer.The Berlin cast, a mix of newer and fresher voices with some Barenboim veterans, is close to being as good as you will hear these days. Michael Volle’s Wotan, in particular, is a commanding interpretation, beautifully sung in full voice and articulated without the slightest bark. Iréne Theorin’s Brünnhilde is tireless, accurate and thoroughly up to the job, though the vocal vibrato gets in the way sometimes and she is the chief sufferer from the hampering that is inflicted by Tim van Steenbergen’s costumes. Andreas Schager is the best Siegfried of the current era. Strength in depth is underlined by redoubtable Wagnerians such as Jochen Schmeckenbecher as Alberich, Anja Kampe as Sieglinde, Ekaterina Gubanova as Fricka and Anna Larsson as Erda. The lovelorn giant Fasolt is even sung by 74-year-old Matti Salminen, who sang the role for Colin Davis at Covent Garden 45 years ago and was part of the Patrice Chéreau Ring at Bayreuth in 1976. But it is Barenboim’s show. He can’t go on conducting the Ring forever. But is he does so again, I’ll be there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd67411371a9a294fd623e369476d85222ea87b5/0_332_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98dd06efe01e9af0590fde47a87e7de8","title":"on the frontline as us troops leave northern syria","story":"Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the , has spent the past week on the frontline of north-east Syria.

Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they projected his approval ratings (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for “quite stupefying ignorance” was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched posters satirising the government’s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday’s People’s Vote march.Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a sand sculpture of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK’s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove’s face and his comment (“We didn’t vote to leave without a deal”) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach.Stewart smiles. “So it’s like: ‘Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.’ And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: ‘Wow, that’s really impressive!’ So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he’ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.”These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don’t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government in fact, they started the project for “catharsis”: they could either laugh or cry – and they would rather laugh. And that’s still true today.“You just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,” says Stewart. “We have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.”That’s not to say, though, that there isn’t serious intent behind the project. “At the moment, we’re thinking, ‘Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?’” says Stewart. “Look, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?”Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it’s told with vim in a new book by the founders, Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders’ connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. “It just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,” says Stewart.The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace’s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose – who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives – is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters.No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on “lions led by the donkeys”, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area.The team didn’t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: “We come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we’ve got, and, speaking personally, isn’t that bothered by getting a conviction.”“It felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,” adds Sadri. “It feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.”Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. “It very nearly didn’t continue as a project,” says Knowles, the man up the £90 B\u0026ampQ ladder that night. “We were covered in paste, couldn’t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere.”Stewart bristles a little. “I would describe it as guerrilla-style,” he smiles, then relents. “No, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.”The plan was always to combine the analogue – billboards – with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the  columnist Marina Hyde through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them.“I didn’t know anything about it at all,” remembers Hyde, “but as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It’s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea – one of the few things on what I suppose you’d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another ‘letter to the Times from 100 businessmen’.”Led By Donkeys describes what it does as “political theatre” and it’s most effective when, whether it’s a physical billboard or the Angel of the North, you can’t just thumb past it on your smartphone. “People talk about how the problems in today’s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,” says Sadri. “So there’s something about taking a politician’s tweet – something that flies past you at a million miles per hour – and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody’s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: ‘We have to look at that if it’s a sunny day, if it’s pissing with rain.’ And it gives you time to digest it if you’re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.”Going straight hasn’t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved.“I did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,” says Stewart. “So suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn’t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.”Still, even if they are “mired in Excel spreadsheets” now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience. There is satisfaction in getting 10,000 retweets from a post, but these days the founders insist they are more excited when their work is picked up by regional papers, sparking local debate. They also want their message to be heard beyond British borders: to that end, they have bought billboard space in Brussels and beamed “SOS” on an EU flag in a 75x50m projection on the Dover cliffs. “Quite something to see the white cliffs of Dover turn blue,” noted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and now the EU parliament’s representative in the Brexit negotiations.“We have a project that definitely reaches Remainers, but what we’re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside that camp,” says Knowles. “And our premise is that there’s a lot of people who have changed their mind who aren’t being heard at the moment. Can we find a way to talk to them and bring them into the discussion?”The concepts can also become more outsized. “Being in Redcar,” says Rose, “watching them draw it out on the sand and then seeing the drone go up and looking at the screen and seeing the message revealed – that was a different level of excitement.”Alastair Campbell suggested that, if Brexit were to be averted, Led By Donkeys would deserve a special award as “secret heroes” of the campaign. But it’s hard to tell what impact, if any, they have had on the political discourse. “I have absolutely no idea!” says Hyde. “I mean it all gets worse, doesn’t it… We know politicians lie or make promises they can’t keep, but that perception seems to have achieved full spectrum dominance on all sides of our political ides. I think the implications of that are still playing out and will do for a long time, but are generally very bad.”Posting the politicians’ quotes without any additional comment or analysis of their own (the idea is to get people talking) has not always worked seamlessly for Led By Donkeys. After putting a pronouncement from Anne Widdecombe – “Homosexual acts are wrongful” – on a billboard in Christchurch, Dorset, they had to apologise and quickly backtrack, noting that some might take her words at “face value”. But mostly the group has shown a sophisticated and intuitive understanding of conveying a political message in 2019. You can’t rely on people seeing a billboard or reading an article in the local paper or not scrolling past a tweet – but if you hit all of those spots then you increase the chance of them seeing one of them.It’s a radical, even pioneering, mashing of old and new media – albeit one that sometimes spirals in ways the four never remotely considered when they started out. “We’ve taken a quote, turned it into a tweet, put it on a billboard, tweeted a photo of that billboard, the tweet’s gone viral, the local newspaper’s written about the viral tweet of a billboard of a tweet, that article itself has gone viral, then our tweet about the article has exploded,” they write in their book. “It’s a kind of meta-virality that we struggle to get our heads round.”For their part, the Led By Donkeys founders will keep hoping, angling for a second referendum. If it does happen, they’re clear that the Remain campaign has to learn lessons from 2016. It shouldn’t base itself in central London, for a start. It has to concentrate on issues that people really care about and “not let Dominic Cummings and that crew spread bullshit about the NHS”. But mainly it has to show an energy and vigour it didn’t have last time. Knowles says: “People have told me, ‘I didn’t feel the Remain campaign offered anything positive. And there was passion and emotion behind the Leave campaign.’ Any new campaign has got to get to the things people love and that’s the NHS, values, education and much more positively framed.”If it comes down to passion – well, here, Led By Donkeys think they will be in their element. And even though they are doing things legally these days, the subversive spirit remains. “We are always on the look out for something that would take us back out there,” says Sadri mischievously. “We were slightly disappointed when the government decided to put its ‘Get Ready for Brexit’ posters on digital screens and not on actual physical billboards, because we’d been honing our ‘cut-out giant letters and re-word giant billboards’ technique.”“The ladder is safely stored,” says Knowles, “and is ready to come out again.”• Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit is published by Atlantic (£10).

It means that we are preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted – and we cannot guarantee that an extension will be granted – that we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.”There is no particular indication that the EU would refuse an extension if needed, and Gove’s comments seem primarily aimed at increasing pressure on MPs to back Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal after the Commons voted on Saturday to withhold immediate support until it could scrutinise the surrounding legislation.This prompted a backbench-instigated law obliging the prime minister to send a letter to the EU seeking a delay beyond 31 October, which Johnson did – albeit accompanied by another letter arguing against this.Gove insisted the UK would definitely leave on 31 October, saying he had made a bet with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that it would happen.“We are going to leave by 31 October,” he said. “We have the means and the ability to do so … yesterday we had some people who voted for delay, voted explicitly to try to frustrate this process and to drag it out. I think actually the mood in the country is clear and the prime minister’s determination is absolute and I am with him in this: we must leave by 31 October.”At the same time as threatening no deal, Gove lavished praise on former Conservative MPs such as Amber Rudd, the former work and pensions secretary, who quit the government and party last month in protest at Johnson seemingly being intent on no deal.Rudd told the Sophy Ridge show earlier that she had backed the amendment on Saturday not to seek a delay but as “an insurance policy”, to try to prevent hardline Brexiter MPs forcing a no-deal outcome at a later point in the process.“I support the prime minister’s deal, and I have told him I will support it next week,” Rudd said. “I understand people’s fatigue – let me tell you, I suffer from it myself – but we have to make sure we don’t leave with no deal.”Rudd said she expected most of the larger group of ex-Tory MPs who lost the party whip for rebelling over Brexit to also back the deal – though, she said, it was not as good as the one put forward by Theresa May and could damage the economy.Johnson’s plan was “less good” for the union in terms of both Scotland and Northern Ireland, Rudd said, saying she understood the reasons why the Democratic Unionist party did not back it.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f64842c18317b586543d62ea6cdbc23a5dbb17ee/0_169_3500_2103/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53904b90c2a1482fd4481fcba4fe47b2","title":"peoples vote split by power struggle at crucial time for alliance","story":"Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd wrangle over future remain campaignA bitter power struggle within the People’s Vote campaign between the PR guru Roland Rudd and the Labour peer Peter Mandelson has sent the alliance into crisis before a crucial week when MPs will finally test support for a second referendum in parliament.The organisation is riven by a battle over who will have control over a remain campaign in any future referendum, even though the case for another vote on Britain’s EU membership has not yet been won.People’s Vote said hundreds of thousands of campaigners turned out to a rally in central London on Saturday to oppose Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, and supportive MPs will attempt to amend legislation to force a second referendum this week.But behind the scenes, there are ongoing rows centring on Rudd’s moves to start a future remain campaign, led by a new female chair, bringing together large numbers of pro-EU bodies and removing some of the current leadership.Rudd told grassroots activists last week that he would step down as chair of Open Britain, the most powerful organisation under the People’s Vote umbrella, while pushing for a wider shake-up and restructuring of the campaign’s leadership.As part of that, there are moves to oust James McGrory, the director of People’s Vote, and Tom Baldwin, its director of communications. About 60 people work for People’s Vote at offices in Millbank, but the shape of the campaign in its current form is now uncertain.One senior supporter said there had been a “clash of egos and personality” between Rudd, the brother of the former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd, and Mandelson. But they said there were also disagreements over how “remainy” the campaign should be and how far it should be linked to a wider realignment of politics, rather than just a vehicle through which to push for a second referendum.Private emails leaked to the Mail on Sunday suggested Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, another former New Labour communications adviser, had been attempting to work together against Rudd this year. In one email, Campbell said: “I do not see how this gets done without a public battle and it should happen soon and be fast and brutal.”It comes at a time when MPs linked to the campaign are trying to win over soft-Brexit Tories, such as Oliver Letwin, Philip Hammond and David Gauke, to their cause in parliament, without scaring them off by turning into the pro-remain campaign of a referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083890fa5f7af96fd53e5220178873d13de38d6c/0_122_3658_2195/master/3658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9da30df8a30531dacec55b0d050d6566","title":"andy murray european open final stan wawrinka tennis","story":"Andy Murray arrived in China four weeks ago with the humble hope of winning one or two matches per week, gradually building his match fitness while aspiring to feel a little more like himself by the end of it all.On Sunday afternoon, after four frantic weeks on the road across two different continents, he left Antwerp with so much more after producing one of the most stunning results of his career to defeat Stan Wawrinka 3-6 6-4 6-4 to win his first title since February 2017.“I think it was a great match. Stan was playing unbelievable - hitting winners from all over the court. I just managed to hang in a bit at the end of the second set and the third set was extremely close again. Amazing. I didn’t expect to be in this position at all, so I’m very, very happy.”Throughout Murray’s career, there has never been a hint of doubt about his fighting qualities and competitiveness, but this entire four-week run had been a testament to his mentality. A few months ago, after Murray began his singles return in Cincinnati, he looked back at his performances and shook his head, doubt circulating. It has been striking to see how linear his improvement has been since as he has gradually won more matches against top players, his movement and serve continues to strengthen.None of that prepared him for the level that Wawrinka arrived with in the final. Wawrinka was on a mission from the very beginning, serving brilliantly and crushing indiscriminately off both wings. The measure of the Swiss’s performance was that Murray was fine throughout the first set - he moved well and continued to force Wawrinka into one extra ball, constantly putting the Swiss into difficult positions.But each time excellence was required of Wawrinka, he came up with something near perfection. Early in the second set, Wawrinka broke with a return game that defied belief. Murray watched four violent winners stream past him. Murray could do nothing but curse.As in every other moment of his career, the Scot reacted with his grit. With Wawrinka up 6-3 3-1 and two break points up, his level finally dropped. Murray won seven points in a row thanks to his defence, forays to the net and every last shot in his arsenal. In the tight, breathless games deep into the second set, it was Murray’s defence that won the battle.The pressure rose throughout the third set, and neither held their serve. Wawrinka fired winners to break twice early in the third set, but Murray’s consistency and defence pegged him back each time. It was the Scot who took control, stamping a hold to lead 4-3. When Wawrinka prowled at 4-4 on Murray’s serve, the Scot dug out two more holds, screaming into his fist before breaking for the title.This is the final flourish to a comeback that has defied belief. Nine months ago he was waved out of the Australian Open to retirement videos as his tearful family watched on. Days later he underwent hip resurfacing surgery and just a couple months ago, he was still learning what it felt to move freely and chase after balls without sharp, debilitating pain.Across the net, Wawrinka provided perspective of the enormity of his success. Wawrinka departed their fateful 2017 Roland Garros semi-final with his knee screaming for mercy and was forced to undergo two surgeries in August 2017. Over two years later, the Swiss has only recently returned to the top 20 and Antwerp marked just his second final since his surgery. Just seven tournaments back from injury, Murray already has won his 46th career title.Murray will now head home to prepare for the birth of his third child with his wife, Kim, who is nine months pregnant. “This is one of the biggest wins I’ve had, after everything,” he said. “I’m really proud of the win this week and I’ve enjoyed my time here.“I’ll have three kids under four years old. I need to get on the road so we don’t get out of control. I’m excited for the third kid. My wife’s been a huge support for getting me back on the court and making me fight to keep playing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b38f0b26af5df8975a6e6fca14fe86a30ae1a0/0_406_4819_2893/master/4819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bac2e2362995b16f747abc1121e0135","title":"wales france playing ratings world cup","story":"Liam Williams Has had an outstanding season for club and country but mainly reduced to defensive duties and coping with aerial threat from France’s tactical kickers. 5George North The wing’s 90th game for Wales was not his most productive and had little chance to threaten the French defence. Well marshalled by Yoann Huget. 6Owen Watkin A late replacement for Jonathan Davies. Had a muscular midfield presence but unable to replicate Davies’s attacking guile. Davies’s creatively was badly missed. 5Hadleigh Parkes Made a vital late try-saving tackle on the bulldozing centre Virimi Vakatawa and his defensive kicking was important. Solid if unspectacular 7Josh Adams He has scored five tries in the tournament and looked razor-sharp but, like all Wales’s backs, had limited opportunities to run at the French defence. 6Dan Biggar Has had an excellent World Cup but unable to exert his usual control, particularly when Wales were on the back foot but his conversion settled a heart-stopping game. 7Gareth Davies Had little opportunity to make sniping breaks but his tactical kicking was important before Tomos Williams made his influential introduction early in the second half. 6Wyn Jones A very solid hour’s work as part of a Welsh scrum that got stronger as the game progressed. Established as Wales’s No 1 No 1. Tackled tirelessly. 7Ken Owens The hooker made 19 tackles and looked reluctant to be hauled off after a lung-busting 75 minutes. One of his best games for his country. 7Tomas Francis The Exeter tighthead may not be first choice at his club but is an important cog in the Welsh machine. Hard-working shift. 7Jake Ball After the break got through a mountain of bruising carrying work to help haul Wales back into the game. Strong hour. 7Alun Wyn Jones The warrior captain epitomises the never-say-die spirit and character of Wales. Was influential in the lineout and the loose. 7Aaron Wainwright His interception try hauled Wales back into the game after their torrid start. Elbow in his face from Vahaamahina turned the game a notch further. 7Justin Tipuric Worked tirelessly in the back row and one particular turnover in the first half kept France at bay. Just pips Owens as Wales’s best forward. 8Josh Navidi Replaced by Ross Moriarty before the half-hour mark and the loss of the big ball-carrier was a blow to Wales. More so when Moriarty was then shown yellow card. 5Ran elusively in what will be his World Cup finale but faded from the game after the break.

The expressionist aesthetics of Schiele’s nudes – emotionally charged and attenuated lines, tense dynamics and oddly contorted poses – seem like a natural fit for contemporary dance. Despite this felicitous figural match, Shobana Jeyasingh’s Staging Schiele doesn’t always make for riveting dance.Part of the lasting power of Schiele’s work lies in the unflinching depiction of his models’ (or his own) genitals – thrust forward, distorted, sometimes hermaphroditic – accompanied by a direct gaze at the viewer. Here, the four dancers strip off gauzy outer garments to reveal flesh-coloured underwear. Though their surly spread-eagling pays homage to Schiele’s bodies, a lot of beige gusset ends up on display. It’s an inadvertent reminder that Schiele’s nether regions are anything but beige.Nevertheless, it’s a slick and skilful production. An upstage structure of slanted metal bars and spare strip lights alludes to Schiele’s brief stint in prison (for obscenity) while evoking a more general sense of spatial dislocation, with washes of pale green and red light suggesting the bruised hues of Schiele’s watercolours.Fragmented video projections of the artist’s face are matched by a collage of sounds and music: excerpts from poems by Rilke and Schiele and the intense scribbling of a pencil are punctuated by orgasmic yelps and unsettling piano.Dancing with a small mirror, Dane Hurst is a nimble and compelling presence in the opening section. As he tries out new perspectives and weird angles, grimaces and gurns, he’s nervously fervent, but buoyed by bourgeois confidence. We see the artist’s obsessive scrutiny of his own body not simply as narcissism, but as an earnest pursuit of some higher truth.Elsewhere, the push and pull of Hurst’s interactions with Catarina Carvalho, Sunbee Han and Estela Merlos – a combination of coercion, collaboration and combat – evokes the ambivalent interplay between artist and model, as well as Schiele’s fraught personal relationships. There are striking moments, but it lacks some crucial light and shade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07c2c1ea68d309df8c5aaf5d541d80d45168787c/0_176_5352_3212/master/5352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5fd62cee2316e19c2bb2520367ed56b","title":"security freedom inside loo 10 years council housing","story":"The number 151 probably doesn’t have much significance for most people, but to my family it instantly conjures a smile and a nostalgic gaze into the middle distance.For my parents, 151 provided an opportunity to bring up their children in their own home and to escape the restrictions of sharing a house with mum’s father and his partner, as they’d done for the first seven years of marriage. For us children – Maxine, Paul and me – 151 brought seven “green and golden” years to our 1950s childhood: playing with friends in the garden or indoors singing and dancing to records on the radiogram helping around the house and running free and safe in the streets and green spaces of a new council estate on the eastern edge of Cardiff.Like many estates in postwar Britain, Llanrumney was planned in a spirit of optimistic reconstruction, holding on to some of the principles of the garden-city movement. Houses were brick-built in small rows rather than the long, dark-stone terraces associated with inner-city Victorian workers’ housing. Decent-sized front and rear gardens offered the opportunity to grow vegetables and to plant shrubs and flowers. Communal green spaces lent an open, airy aspect, as did the playing fields of Rumney Rec and the woodlands of legend-haunted Llanrumney Hall.In spring 1953 we were one of the first families on the estate. Dad had to go to work the day we moved in because he couldn’t afford a day off, so he cycled to Wagon Repairs Ltd in the docks, where he was a carpenter, while Johnny Workman’s van moved whatever possessions we had to 151. A concrete path led to the porch and blue door downstairs, a front room for best, a hallway and kitchenette, a small living room at the back upstairs, three bedrooms and bathroom. A bonus was “the outhouse”: with a separate front entrance, it was a passageway to the back garden, big enough to store coal, bikes, tools, paint, toys, etc, as well as having – wonder of wonders! – a second toilet.Our neighbours were couples in their 30s who’d survived the war and started young families – the Fletchers, Checketts, Wickhams and the Carrs in the corner house with the big front garden and garage. Friendships came easily. With hardly any traffic, we organised noisy street games such as touch, hopscotch and “Please Jack, may I cross the water?”, stretched a rope across the road and chanted skipping rhymes, roller-skated down the hill, sprinted to the lamp-post and back, or spent all day down the Rec playing football, cricket and baseball – the Welsh version, native only to Cardiff, Newport and Liverpool over the border.Perhaps it’s a boy’s-eye view, but our parents didn’t seem anxious about us venturing all over the estate on our bikes or wandering down to Rumney River where the bridge at the end of Ball Lane gave access to open countryside.It’s still largely taboo to talk negatively about social housing. Those who had places to sleep affordably – no matter how damp or dangerous or stricken with social problems – are meant to be grateful.Before I turned 16, I lived on eight different council estates, big and small, north and south, as well as homeless B\u0026ampBs, housing association flats and small private rentals designed for housing benefit recipients. My single mum with two children in tow was often shuttled to the top of the housing list. We were usually put in the flat no one wanted, on the estates that would be no one’s preference. Flats on the top floor with no working lift ones by the communal bins for hundreds of people a ground-floor flat with damp so thick I used to draw pictures in it with my finger while trying to sleep. Estates where rubbish was left to pile up, and crime, violence or drugs went unchecked. Compared with the alternative, social housing where we knew we would not be evicted, where the housing benefit would suffice, where if something went wrong with our flat we could ask for it to be fixed (even if it might take many months), was a better option by far.So, I am grateful for those things. The problem is that as I got older I went into the wider world and came to understand how badly we had been failed by those who held the purse and power strings. That utopian dream of decent, affordable housing for all became a dystopian reality.Of course, you’re welcome to disagree, but then I’ll ask you to tell me something, anything, more dystopian than watching 72 social-housing tenants die in a tower of flames in the fifth richest city in the world. Grenfell happened because the residents were poor, ignored and no one gave a shit.If we are to campaign for more social housing, let it be social housing which is fit for purpose, designed to be a home for a community of happy, productive citizens. Integrate it with the community and amenities, imagine not that the folk living there will be staying home all day watching Cash In The Attic, but that they will have jobs to go to, friends and family to see, purses full of cash that they want to spend in the high street. Imagine the children growing up on that estate will become your future politicians, doctors, broadcasters, artists and scientists – so make sure they can get to school safely, that they’ll remain physically and mentally healthy, and that they like where they live so much that they will choose to stay and contribute to a community they are grateful for.After her orce, my mother chose to move to Bristol. We lived in one room in a house of multiple occupation in Easton for more than a year in 1975-6 and shared a bed that was no more than a big piece of foam on the floor.Aged 11, I befriended an older girl at Lawrence Weston comprehensive school who was also dating the local hard man. I was not untouchable, but I did now have someone to watch over me, as no one messed with “Sally”. My quick wits meant I made a range of friends from different backgrounds. You could count the number of black families on the estate on one hand.Due to my mother’s insistence I addressed all my friends’ parents as “Mr” or “Mrs”. This meant I often got invited to “tea”, something my West Indian upbringing had no reference of, but I intrinsically knew was an important occasion. While I played with their children, these various parents would fill the gaps in the void left by the rest of my family being more than 120 miles away in London. We lived without fear of life’s everyday dangers. Soon we had a tight gang of kinship rather than terror. We fought, argued, laughed and cried together. The youth clubs, boxing gyms and a plethora of sporting clubs kept most of us away from the glue-sniffers, speed-freaks and junkies.I miss the banter and camaraderie of life on the estate. It could be vicious, yet have the most acerbic observational humour of the finest stand-up comedians. It certainly helped to build my character, sharp tongue and canny pragmatic skills in response to an array of insults and challenges. There were no safe spaces and this sink-or-swim approach to growing up is not recommended for the faint-hearted.As I grew older, I became more aware of the ritual racist abuse. I recall one vicious attack that took place when I was alone at a bus stop, which left me physically and mentally scarred. It was carried out by two assailants who shouted “nigger” at me, iniduals who hated what they didn’t understand. I was lucky, I got up: Stephen Lawrence in similar circumstances did not.Clint Eastwood was our hero back then and I describe my time in Lawrence Weston as “the Good, the Bad and the Ugly”. The reality for a skinny, small black kid on the brink of adolescence without immediate family or friends meant life was tough, but it was also the making of this man.The day we got the keys, I burst into the house, darted through the kitchen, ran up the stairs and headed straight for the room at the end of the landing.Out of breath, I opened the door, walked tentatively in and closed it behind me. Everything smelled new. The bath, white and glistening, was to the right, the sink straight ahead, and the toilet to the left beside a small radiator. I was amazed.This was to be our family’s first bathroom. The home we were leaving was a two-up-two-down Victorian terraced house in the lower Falls Road area of west Belfast, with no central heating, no bathroom and riddled with damp. The toilet was outside in the yard.I was seven-and-a-half when we were told there was a new four-bedroom house for my parents and the six of us children to move into just a few streets away. Other things I remember: the aroma of naked wood and freshly applied plaster lots of doors and built-in cupboards in which to store things large windows the excitement of a garden back and front the small playground right outside the door with climbing bars the anticipation of the friends I would make and the things we would do in this place, which was filled with newly planted trees in the streets and places to play.What I soon came to understand was that the new estates springing up in and around Belfast in the mid-to-late 1970s were a response to poor housing, and also to the historical discrimination that meant the Protestant majority experienced favourable allocation of council housing while those from Catholic backgrounds were left behind. Many families had also been displaced due to violence and sectarian intimidation related to the Troubles.What I now know is that the rehousing process resulted in even greater segregation of the two communities and that this had longer-term ramifications for sectarianism and ision, including the emergence of “peace lines” along what are called “interface areas”, where largely Catholic and Protestant working-class communities border one another. These walls remain a prominent feature of many Belfast communities today.My early years living on our council estate included watching as a massive brick “peace wall” was constructed across one perimeter. It was a security decision. There were frequently pitched battles between people on both sides of the ide sometimes they involved shooting. Over time, however, other walls went up. Parts of the estate – which had felt open and accessible when we first moved in – were cordoned off by a series of smaller walls that made it difficult to enter or exit certain areas. When I returned to visit family and friends on as a young adult, it was beginning to feel more like a containment area than a housing estate.Homes for Heroes 100: Council Estate Memories, published as part of last week’s Festival of the Future City in Bristol, supported by funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Bristol City Council.

A problematic show in which her family shadow the lives of a Namibian tribe should put an end to itWhere on the Scarlett-Moffatt-Is-England’s-Rose-O-Meter™ are we at the moment? I always forget. There was that ascent to fame when she sat horizontal on a sofa and said arch things on Gogglebox: we quite liked her then. After that there was the predictable I’m A Celeb … win and the boom-and-bust fitness DVD: an unfurling of the bud. After that, the full bloom of Moffattism, where she was drafted by ITV as a sort of Ant and Dec ancillary on Saturday Night Takeaway, turning them from a diarchy to a triumvirate by holding cue cards a lot and waving.Since then, a holy silence: the panel-show guest appearances, some sort of Instagram controversy about a skirt, a little McDonald’s spon-con. And now this, The British Tribe Next Door (Tuesday, 9.15pm, Channel 4), one final swing of the Moffatt bat, a last attempt to cement her as beloved in the British canon, a sort of Kerry KatonaPrincess Diana mash-up event and a, uh, show where her and her family live in a faithfully rebuilt version of their County Durham terrace house in among the mud-and-stone huts of a Namibian tribe.I doubt I am the first to say this and I will not be the last, but: what? On paper, you would be right to think that this does not sound like a good idea. In practice, it is also very much not a good idea. The vague intention is: the Moffatts – dad Mark, who is boring mum Betty, who is boring the teen sister Ava-Grace is mostly mute – move in with the semi-nomadic Himba tribe in Namibia, and they stay in an exact replica of their home (frustratingly glossed over are the logistics of building an exact replica of Scarlett Moffatt’s house in the middle of the Namib desert. I would rather watch an hour of someone explaining how they erected an untethered terrace with electricity and running water in such a setting than, say, the dire five-minute segment where Mark Moffatt goes metal detecting and finds a whistle). The Himba – who are pitched somewhere between props for the Moffatts to bounce off and actual, rounded people with their own thoughts and feelings and to-camera segments – patiently explain to the Moffatts how much they prize their livestock’s health, shy away from excessive possessions and dress traditionally the Moffatts nod and point to a plug socket and say: “That box, very spiky!”This is the thing: what would otherwise be, at the very edges, a semi-interesting anthropological exploration – a member of the Himba sees her face for the first time in a mirror Betty’s new friend, Ueripanga, marvels at the time-saving practicality of a washing machine cattle herder Mbiki questions the fundamental need for an upstairs – is ruined because all of the Moffatts are totally uninquisitive, only seeming to venture out of their new build when lured there by the camera crew. Their every interaction with the tribe is boiled down to slowly walking somewhere with them and saying: “Oh you do this, do you?” and looking scared whenever someone starts dancing. It feels as if there were other ways to clang Scarlett Moffatt stiffly over the head with life lessons, frankly. Time to stop shovelling manure on this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01f395840f0e3906cc6769e5bd7dda161f634500/0_113_4285_2570/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac21a36477a0b24b7c6c05119ef856a","title":"strictly come dancing 2019 week five live","story":"Twelve couples remain, but who won’t be taking a turn round the Halloween dancefloor next week?

She’s singing her huge hit ‘Don’t Call Me Up’ from earlier this year. Right now she’s got a track with Tiesto called ‘God is a Dancer’ in the charts that’s an absolute banger – Mabel’s music is very much my cup of tea, and great to see more contemporary artists on Strictly.Also, pop fact fans – as lots of people have mentioned in the comments, Mabel is the daughter of 80s chart queen Neneh Cherry. I was a huge fan of her too, so I find this rather pleasing.More couples safely through to next week: Alex and Neil, Karim and Amy, Michelle and Giovanni and Kelvin and Oti.They’re dragging this out, but it’s pretty clear that David and Nadiya are in trouble. So who is safely through to the HALLOWEEN SPECIAL next week? Will and Janette are safe, along with Saffron and AJ and Emma and Aljaz.First couple in the bottom two: MIKE AND KATYA. Last night on Strictly: what a difference a week makes. Great dancing, fabulous costumes, dance-appropriate music and scoring that largely made sense (Alfonso bonuses aside). Highlights included an extraordinary contemporary routine from Will and Janette, a high-speed Salsa from Karim and Amy, a dreamy Viennese from Emma and Aljaz and a hip-thrusting Samba (in name only) from Mike and Katya. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: two oven-ready roasting bags. I’ll set the timer. And we’re off! This week’s opening pro dance has a red carpet theme to ‘Fame’ by David Bowie. Loving Nadiya’s angel wings and skimpy undergarments, Oti looks incredible in that catsuit, and I could watch Johannes vogue in heels all day. SLAY.Well that was incredible. God I love this show.

On Countryfile, Matt Baker is lathing a pole whilst wearing a gilet *fans self*. Meanwhile all the animals appear to be pregnant. I’m not saying these two things are related, but we probably shouldn’t discount it.Evening all, and welcome back to this week’s Strictly Results Show! Last night’s ride aboard the Alfonso Express was my favourite of the season so far – much as Bruno is a Strictly institution, Alfonso was a welcome breath of fresh air. He’s like a puppy that relentlessly licks your face when you’re having a bad day – even though it’s kind of annoying, you can’t help but feel better. Can’t see how David and Nadiya aren’t going home this evening – I’d be amazed if they’re not in the bottom two, and only Mike and Katya taking both bits of Samba out of their routine could save them. Given the choice, I think I’d rather have Mike in the Halloween Special than David, although both are good sports. Kick off is at 7.15pm, so I’ll see you then!

Sanders had a heart attack, his campaign said as he was released from hospital.At 78, Sanders is the oldest major presidential candidate. If elected, he will be the oldest president inaugurated. Asked in Tuesday’s debate how he would “reassure Democratic voters that you’re up to the stress of the presidency”, he plugged the New York event.“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,” he said. “That is how I think I can reassure the American people.”On Saturday, Sanders strolled on stage to Back in Black by ACDC.He was, he said, happy to report that he is “more than ever ready to carry out with you the epic struggle that we face today”.“There is no question that I and my family have faced adversity over these last few weeks,” Sanders said. “The untold story is that people everywhere in this country, in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, are facing their own adversities.”Sanders then launched into policy proposals on education, climate change and healthcare. His speech lasted almost an hour.Though Sanders trails the former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in most polls, he is beating them in fundraising. From July to September, Sanders raised $25.3m, edging out Warren’s $24.6m and Biden’s $15.2m.There was no shortage of support in Queensbridge Park. Sanders said the campaign got a permit for 20,000 and had to turn people away. The security company handling the event reportedly said more than 25,000 were there.The 30-year-old congresswoman and progressive star gave Sanders a surprise endorsement this week. Her district is less than a mile from Long Island City, where Sanders set his stage. They were joined by New York politicians, the director and writer Michael Moore, and Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan.Before she became a celebrity in her own right, Ocasio-Cortez was an organizer for Sanders. Some founders of Justice Democrats, the political action committee that helped organize her campaign, are former Sanders staffers.“I’m proud to say that the only reason I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved that you can run a grassroots campaign in an America where we almost thought it wasn’t possible,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez spoke about her upbringing in a working-class family, her mother born in Puerto Rico and her father in the South Bronx. When she was born, she said, her parents had a one-bedroom apartment with a mattress on the floor and a crib on the closet.“That’s how we started our American dream,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez said Sanders’ support for access to healthcare and housing directly benefited her family.“When you rewind on that story, when I was a baby, my family relied on Planned Parenthood for pre-natal care. Then, Bernie Sanders fought for me. When the federal government decided to discriminate and abandon my queer family and friends, Bernie Sanders was putting his career on the line for us.”Ocasio-Cortez reflected on her first nine months in Congress.“Every trick in the book, psychological and otherwise, is used to get us to abandon the working class,” she said. “It has been in that experience … that I have grown to appreciate the enormous consistent, non-stop advocacy of Senator Bernie Sanders.”Sanders thanked Ocasio-Cortez and said: “It is hard to believe the degree to which she has transformed politics in America.“I am so delighted that Alexandria is part of our campaign, and I look forward to traveling with her all over this country,” he added.Among the fans, Ron Widelec, 38, a teacher from Westchester county, proudly sported a hoodie from 2016.“He looked great at the debate, so any concerns I had are gone,” he said. “I invite any of the candidates to try to keep up with him.”Julia Camacchio, 21, a student based in Middlebury, Vermont, said she was initially on the fence between Sanders and Warren but was persuaded when Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, another member of the progressive “Squad”, endorsed Sanders.“To see that added extra support for me really solidified my vote,” she said.Multiple supporters suggested Sanders’ health problems, while concerning, were hyped by the media.Al Merenda, 60, from Newburgh, New York, who was accompanied by his 10-year-old son, said that he had two stents inserted in his heart about 10 years ago: “It doesn’t mean anything, and you’re good to go for another 20 years.“He’s fine. He’s more than fine. Even if he wasn’t, it’s still a better pick. Even if something happens, you still want him in office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8251bcb4c6b98af267690996d37063a7578d8664/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1f5cf6b0b194379cef8d0d15521deae","title":"nancy pelosi visits jordan to discuss turkish syria incursion","story":"Evacuation part of US-brokered ceasefire, as Nancy Pelosi leads congressional visit to regionKurdish officials say their fighters have evacuated Ras al-Ayn, giving Turkey and its allies control of one of the border cities that has borne the brunt of fighting since Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria.The Turkish defence ministry said a convoy of 86 vehicles left the city on Sunday afternoon carrying fighters from the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Front (SDF) and wounded civilians south to cities beyond the 20-mile buffer zone that Turkey is seeking to clear along its border with Syria.Kino Gabriel, an SDF spokesman, confirmed Ras al-Ayn had been abandoned as part of a five-day, US-brokered ceasefire with Turkey, in place since Thursday. “We don’t have any more fighters in the city,” he said.Fighters remain deployed in other areas inside the buffer zone including the cities Kobane and al-Darbasiyah, Kurdish activists said.Hostilities in the 11-day-old campaign were paused last week to allow Kurdish fighters to safely retreat from the border area following talks in Ankara between the US vice-president Mike Pence and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Turkey and the Kurds have both accused each other of violating the temporary truce.Erdoğan said on Saturday that his country would “crush the heads” of Kurdish militants if they did not withdraw in time. He said he would discuss the deployment of Syrian government forces in the safe zone during talks with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, next week, but warned Ankara would “implement its own plans” if a solution was not reached.Trump has faced rare bipartisan criticism in the US for his surprise announcement this month that American troops would stand aside as Turkey mounted an operation to push US-backed Kurdish forces in Syria, its allies in the fight against Isis, at least 20 miles (32km) away from its southern border.dThe US withdrawal, which led the Kurds to turn to Moscow to broker an agreement with the Syrian regime to protect them against the Turkish onslaught, has been described by Congress’s most senior Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, as “a grave mistake”.Former CIA director and retired US military general David Petraeus said on Sunday that the US had abandoned its Kurdish allies. “They took over 10,000 losses as the defeat of Islamic State was carried out, the elimination of the caliphate that Isis had,” he told CNN.“This is a very sudden exit. And this does not end an endless war. It probably prolongs it, because this gives Isis an opportunity for a resurgence.”Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, at the weekend led a bipartisan congressional delegation to Jordan, a staunch US ally that contributed to the global coalition that defeated Islamic State in Syria, and met the country’s ruler, King Abdullah II, on Saturday evening, to discuss the fallout from Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from neighbouring Syria.Pelosi and other senior Democrats walked out of an acrimonious meeting with Trump over the issue last week and accused the president of having a “meltdown”.It is “a critical time for the security and stability of the region”, Pelosi said in a statement from Amman. “With the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey’s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees and the dangerous opening that has been provided to Isis, Iran and Russia,” she said.Meanwhile, US troops were seen on Sunday leaving a key base in northern Syria with their equipment, apparently part of a broad US withdrawal ordered by Trump.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who had accompanied Pence to Turkey, said on Sunday he was “optimistic” about the ceasefire. “There’s relatively little fighting, a little sporadic small-arms fire, a mortar or two,” he told ABC.Erdoğan unleashed the offensive against the Kurds on 9 October, agreeing to a pause after Pence and Pompeo rushed to Turkey amid mounting international outrage.The Turkish defence ministry said on Sunday that one Turkish soldier was killed in an attack by Kurdish fighters in the Tal Abyad border area.The Kurdish Red Crescent, a humanitarian group unaffiliated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said 20 civilians had died and another 20 had been injured in attacks by Turkey or its allies since the start of the ceasefire.Pelosi’s unscheduled visit was in keeping with several overseas delegations led by the House that have highlighted gaps between the Trump administration’s position and those held by Congress, including by many Republicans.In April she visited the Irish border to warn about the risk of a hard Brexit threatening the Good Friday agreement, which the US helped to broker in 1998. Trump administration officials have said they would “enthusiastically” back Britain leaving the EU without a deal.Pelosi and other congressional leaders attended the Munich security conference in February, delivering reassuring messages to some of the European leaders whom Trump has accused of failing to contribute their share to Nato and the US-led campaign against Isis. Pilots from Jordan took part in airstrikes as part of the US-led coalition against Isis, a role that became prominent after the capture and filmed murder of a Jordanian air force lieutenant, Muath al-Kasasbeh, by Isis militants.There are thought to be up to 2,000 Jordanian members of Isis held in makeshift prisons across north-east Syria. The US continues to deploy troops at the al-Tanf base on the Syrian border with Jordan.A report by Petra News, Jordan’s state-run news agency, said the king “stressed the need to reach a political solution to the crisis that preserves the unity of Syria and its people and guarantees the voluntary and safe return of refugees”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/871c4914cc608c0d4d822dd7356fd788d8ac236f/0_99_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5363e064fd4835f0b9172536fa9440b","title":"lebanons mass revolt against corruption and poverty continues","story":"Dissent gains momentum with country’s largest protests since Cedar revolution of 2005The largest protests in Lebanon in 14 years are set to shut down the country for a fifth day on Monday, as a revolt against a weak government, ailing services and a looming economic collapse continues to gain momentum.Demonstrators took to the streets of most urban centres on Sunday to rail against officials who they say are preventing badly needed reforms that would cut into the pockets of the ruling class, and are instead trying to recoup state revenues by taxing the poor.Dissent erupted on Thursday after new taxes were announced including a $6 per month levy on the messaging application WhatsApp, which was instrumental in sending protesters on to the streets. Anger boiled over on Friday, leading to the ransacking of high-end shops in Beirut and the death of one man in the northern city of Tripoli.Since then, the protests have settled into large peaceful gatherings that have crossed sectarian and social lines and continued to grow in size and energy as Lebanese leaders struggled to formulate a response.Lebanese flags dominated the Beirut skyline on Sunday, with the flags of political groups or militias largely absent – a rarity in earlier protests. Sheikh Fadi Saad, a Shia cleric, said: “I am a man of God. I must stand with the people. All politicians and all the sects they represent are corrupt. I have two sons, one in Lyon and one in Versaille why should they be working there? There is no dignity left in this country.”While demonstrations are not uncommon in Lebanon, crowds of this size taking to the streets for such a duration have not been seen since the so-called Cedar revolution of 2005, which led to Syrian forces leaving the country after 15 years of post-civil war involvement in its neighbour’s affairs.That moment was supposed to usher in a new era of governance in which local officials were freer to manage national affairs. Instead, rampant corruption and nepotism have taken hold across state institutions and the gap between a privileged elite and the rest of the country has widened.Ali, 32, one of the thousands of unemployed Lebanese people, said: “The ‘hidden hand’ the politicians will soon start speaking of, the ‘conspiracy against our sovereignty’ is false.

But we’ll show them.”A devaluation against the dollar is widely viewed as a tipping point by economists and diplomats. They have urged Lebanese leaders to introduce deep structural reforms to free up revenues and pave the way for $11bn in soft loans and grants that could stimulate a moribund economy.The aid package was put together by France, which has insisted on tangible efforts to change a deeply entrenched patronage network, which has seen political leaders siphon of billions of dollars of state revenues to use to pay benefactors and secure votes.Nearby, Hussein el Hek, 21, also unemployed, said: “Tasty food has become a luxury. I haven’t seen a single politician sacrifice a salary. They’re not only stealing, they’re stealing shamelessly. It’s got to a point where they’re literally the cause of cancer in people. All politicians are staying much longer than they deserve, and when they leave we have to deal with their children.“I can’t afford my daily life, I can’t afford to be in love, I can’t afford to marry, I can’t afford to take care of my own.

File photograph: The What’s the story with Dáil electronic voting?TDs vote by electronic means and press a Tá (for Yes) or Nil (for No) with the appropriate green or red button on the bench in front of them. There is also a blue button for Staon (Abstain).Each member has a designated seat from which they vote and a large screen at the front of the chamber, which is also shown on TV monitors, displays each red green and blue vote as a dot.The electronic system is used for the majority of votes but not when a government and ministers are being voted on. This requires TDs to walk through the voting lobbies.A walk-through vote takes about 20 minutes while the first electronic vote of a sitting takes 12 minutes, allowing time for TDs to get to the chamber, with subsequent votes quicker.Every Thursday at lunchtime there is a block voting session when TDs vote on private members’ motions and on legislation.What happened on Thursday with Fianna Fáil TD Timmy Dooley?Eight votes were taken on Thursday: three on a Green Party motion about afforestation four on a Sinn Féin motion about the living wage and one on a Fianna Fáil motion about electric scooters. Mr Dooley was absent for all eight votes but was registered as having voted six times. The Oireachtas video shows him in the chamber just before the voting commenced, talking to an official and then to party colleague Niall Collins before leaving.What did he say happened?When asked about the issue by the Irish Independent on Friday, Mr Dooley replied “there must have been a mistake or something” and “I don’t know anything about it”. On Saturday he told The  that he “left the chamber to take a phone call. I was made aware yesterday that my vote was recorded . . . I understand from Niall Collins, that under the mistaken belief that I was at the back of the chamber on the phone, he pressed my voting button.”Mr Dooley said he spoke to the Ceann Comhairle to explain and apologise.What did Mr Collins say?He confirmed he voted for Mr Dooley on six occasions last Thursday and that he did so without being asked.“I thought he was up the back of the chamber, in the lobby, on the phone up there. But when I checked it with him he had actually exited the chamber.”Mr Collins said he was not asked by Mr Dooley to vote for him.Are TDs allowed to vote for each other?TDs vote for each other if they have moved from their assigned seat to speak to another member and will ask a colleague to press the button on their bench. Sometimes TDs go to the back of the chamber to take a phone call and will ask someone in their row to press the button. The protocols for voting are set out in the handbook that each new TD receives when elected to the Dáil.What happens nowThe Ceann Comhairle has asked the clerk of the Dáil to prepare a report on the conduct of the votes. The final sanction will be determined on the outcome of the report by the Ceann Comhairle but Mr Dooley and Mr Collins have been asked by\u0026nbspparty leader Micheál Martin to step down from the Fianna Fáil front bench without prejudice.Are expenses contingent on being present for votes?No. TDs are required to sign in daily and do so electronically by pressing a fob against any of several devices on walls at various locations around Leinster House. A daily allowance is paid for attendance.\u0026nbspDo TDs often vote for each other when someone is absent from the House?Mr Martin said that the practice is not commonplace. Public Accounts Committee chairman Seán Fleming, a Fianna Fáil TD, said he had “never seen it happen”. He said TDs from all parties can see on the screen how everyone is voting and who is absent.What can be done to prevent it happening again?Labour leader Brendan Howlin said that in the European Parliament MEPs have to insert an identity card before they can vote electronically at their assigned seat. This option was considered but dismissed for the Dáil on the grounds that TDs might lose their ID cards. It may be that in future TDs will have to remain in their assigned seat for the duration of the voting bloc and be permitted to press only their own button.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4056837.1571572137!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bridge linking northern ireland and scotland should not be dismissed varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Leo Varadkar arriving  for the second day of a two-day summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on Friday. He said the idea of a bridge linking Northern Ireland to Scotland “needs to be looked at”. Photograph:   Sean GallupGetty ImagesThe proposal to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland should not be dismissed out of hand, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. “I know people dismiss it, but I don’t. It needs to be looked at, it needs to be at least examined,” Mr Varadkar told the Sunday Times while in Brussels. British prime minister Boris Johnson has previously come out in favour of what would be a massive infrastructure project linking Scotland and Northern Ireland. “Prime minister Johnson is genuinely interested in taking a serious look at this idea of building a bridge between Antrim and Scotland,” Mr Varadkar said. “I’ve seen what the Chinese have got … 100km-long bridges. I don’t know if it is viable but I also don’t think it should be dismissed out of hand, and I know he is particularly excited about that one,” he said. The road connection between Northern Ireland and Scotland has previously been promoted by the Democratic Unionist Party. Speaking at a hustings event during the Conservative Party leadership race in July Mr Johnson said he was “an enthusiast” for the proposal. “I’m going to put it out there, I think it’s a good idea but again that is the kind of project that should be pursued by a dynamic Northern Ireland government championed by local people with local consent and interest, backed by local business and mobilised by the politicians in Northern Ireland,” he said.Mr Johnson has previously said the estimated cost of the project would be around €17 billion.

File photograph: James FordeThe Mr Martin made the announcement on Sunday, and Mr Dooley and Mr Collins will stand down pending the results of an investigation by the Ceann Comhairle into the affair.On Saturday Mr Dooley, the party’s spokesman on communications, the environment and natural resources, apologised after it emerged Mr Collins voted for him six times while he was not in the Dáil last Thursday.Speaking to The  on Saturday, he said he understood his colleague Mr Collins, a TD for Limerick and Fianna Fáil’s foreign affairs spokesman, voted on his behalf.“I don’t think it’s acceptable,” Mr Martin said on Sunday at the annual Fianna Fáil Wolfe Tone commemoration in Bodenstown, Co Kildare.“I agree with the Ceann Comhairle that the integrity of the voting system in Dáil Éireann is of the utmost importance. It must be protected and it must be respected at all times,” he said.“I spoke to both deputies this morning. And I asked them without prejudice and pending the outcome of the report that the Ceann Comhairle has initiated into this, that they would step down from the Fianna Fáil front bench, and they both agreed to do that.“And I think that underlines the seriousness with which I take this issue. I think it’s important that the Ceann Comhairle’s inquiry now gets underway. And they have both assured me that they will cooperate fully with the Ceann Comhairle in relation to this,” he added.‘Unsatisfactory’Pressed as to whether he had asked the two TDs if it had happened before, Mr Martin said “I’m not conducting an inquiry into this. As far as I’m concerned the proper forum for that is the Oireachtas itself.”He also cautioned against criticism of Fianna Fáil actions and referred to the controversy over Fine Gael TD Maria Bailey’s personal injuries claim.“I think Fine Gael should be careful,” he said, adding that he was prepared to wait for the Ceann Comhairle’s inquiry which “is non-partisan.“I think we’ve learned from Fine Gael’s internal inquiry into the Maria Bailey case how limited and how unsatisfactory an internal review can be by a political party. It can lack transparency and lack the necessary full candour that investigations like this require”.Mr Martin said he did not believe the practice was “commonplace” to place a vote for a TD who is absent form the Dáil. “It hasn’t been my experience.”Earlier the party’s deputy leader Dara Calleary said the actions of Mr Collins in voting for Mr Dooley who was absent from the Dáil was “unusual” .He welcomed the investigation announced by Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl on Saturday into the affair.‘Pressed my voting button’Mr Dooley said on Saturday he was present in the Dáil on Thursday and went to the Dáil chamber after the voting bell sounded.“I left the chamber to take a phone call. I was made aware yesterday that my vote was recorded.“I understand from Niall Collins, that under the mistaken belief that I was at the back of the chamber on the phone, he pressed my voting button.”Mr Dooley, a TD for Clare, added: “I have spoken to the Ceann Comhairle today, to explain what happened and apologise for the misunderstanding.”The Ceann Comhairle on Saturday asked the clerk of the Dáil to urgently prepare a report on the conduct of the votes.In a statement he said: “The integrity of the voting system in Dáil Éireann is of the utmost importance. As Ceann Comhairle, I have a duty to ensure that the public can have total confidence in the Dáil’s proceedings.“Further to media reports on votes in the Dáil last Thursday 17 October 2019, I have asked the clerk of the Dáil to prepare a report on the conduct of the votes for my urgent attention”.Mr Collins confirmed he voted for Mr Dooley on six occasions on Thursday, adding that he did so without being asked.“I thought he was up the back of the chamber, in the lobby, on the phone up there, but when I checked it with him, he had actually exited the chamber,” he said.Mr Collins said he wasn’t asked by Mr Dooley to vote for him.“No, he didn’t ask me, to be fair,” he told The .PermissionAsked if he was allowed to vote for another TD with or without their permission, he said: “I don’t know the answer to that.”“It’s not commonplace, but often someone might be taking a phone call or somebody might be having a conversation at the other side of the chamber and you might say to somebody ‘press the button’, or they might be sitting in the wrong seat,” he added.Sinn Féin TD Maurice Quinlivan urged the Oireachtas Committee on Procedure and Privilege to investigate the incident.He also called for last Thursday’s Dáil votes to be retaken. “It’s an absolute disgrace that Fianna Fáil TDs think they can act with such disregard for the rules and show such a level of arrogance by voting in the name of another TD not present in the Dáil chamber,” he added.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Sunday Mr Calleary said he had no objection to the votes being retaken and had complete faith in the Ceann Comhairle to investigate what occurred. He said he expected the Ceann Comhairle would make an initial assessment before any decision was made on referring the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privilege.Asked about the fact that Mr Collins voted six times on Mr Dooley’s behalf he said this was “unusual”.Martin Heydon, the Fine Gael party chairman said on Saturday that Mr Dooley, Mr Collins and Fianna Fáil need to bring immediate clarity to what occurred.“I trust Deputy Dooley is in no doubt of the seriousness of this matter. There can be no question of impropriety ... this needs to be explained in full immediately and Fianna Fáil have not done so today.“The right to vote in our parliament is a privilege and is central to our democracy,” he said.TDs have a specific seat assigned to them so their electronic votes can be tracked."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4056821.1571568815!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu member states adopt wait and see approach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A boy waves the EU flag during a demonstration   against Brexit, in London on Saturday  as members of parliament sat  to debate and vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s final Brexit deal. Photograph: Vickie FloresEPAEU member states will wait a few days to see what happens in London before they decide whether to grant the UK another extension or decide how long it should be for. “No one is rushing the fences”, one diplomatic source said on Sunday morning.Council President Donald Tusk tweeted on Saturday night that he was consulting capitals on how to respond, a process likely to take a few days.“It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible,” the European Commission’s chief spokeswoman said.When the member states get some clarity on whether the Commons ratification will run beyond October 31st or is set to founder, they may convene another summit before that date. A decision to grant an extension has to be unanimous.Heads of government like Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and French President Emmanuel Macron have been keen to emphasise that the decision is not automatic, a way perhaps of concentrating minds in the Commons on a binary choice between this deal and no-deal. But few in Brussels expect a request to be denied if and when it comes.Should the deal be approved by MPs and simply require a few extra days for the parliamentary business of clearing the necessary legislation, it is likely that a summit would be unnecessary and the decision could be taken by written procedure.In the event the deal is blocked a longer extension may be granted - one senior diplomat suggested last week that any longer extension would only be granted on condition an election is planned.Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland, said his country welcomed the Commons vote “not as a rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement but a postponement of its acceptance”.“Avoiding chaotic, no-deal #Brexit should be our top priority,” he tweeted.Ambassadors of the EU 27 met on Sunday morning for a brief meeting to formally approve the Brexit deal agreed by leaders at the summit and to send it on to the European Parliament which has to vote on it.Sources say the meeting which lasted barely 15 minutes had no discussion of extensions although the secretariat announced it had received the three letters from London.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator said the Brexit Steering Group of MEPs would meet on Monday. Parliament sources had suggested a vote during this week’s plenary session might have been possible had Saturday’s vote been in favour, but the Commons uncertainty now means MEPs are unlikely to want to approve a deal which may yet be rejected."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057013.1571588911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pelosi in jordan to discuss aftermath of us pull out from syria","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNancy Pelosi led a bipartisan delegation to Jordan at the weekend where a meeting with King Abdullah II took place. File photograph: The New York TimesUS speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has paid an unannounced visit to Jordan to discuss the fallout from President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria, where Turkey and the Kurds are accusing each other of violating a temporary ceasefire.Ms Pelosi led a bipartisan congressional delegation to Jordan and met the country’s ruler, King Abdullah II, on Saturday evening. Jordan is a staunch US ally and contributed to the global coalition that defeated Islamic State in Syria.The visit came at “a critical time for the security and stability of the region”, said Ms Pelosi. “With the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey’s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to Isis, Iran and Russia.”On Thursday US vice-president Mike Pence brokered a five-day ceasefire to allow Kurdish fighters leave the Syrian border area.Both sides have accused each other of violating the truce. Turkey’s defence ministry said at the weekend that Kurdish fighters had carried out 14 “provocative” attacks but insisted its own forces were respecting the agreement.The Kurdish Red Crescent, a humanitarian group unaffiliated with the International Committee for the Red Cross, said 20 civilians had died and another 20 had been injured in attacks by Turkey or its allies since the start of the ceasefire.Mr Trump has faced rare bipartisan criticism for his surprise announcement this month that American troops would stand aside as Turkey mounted an operation to push US-backed Kurdish forces in Syria at least 20 miles from its southern border.The US withdrawal has been described by Congress’s most senior Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, as “a grave mistake”. Moreover it has led the Kurds to rely on Moscow to broker an agreement with the Syrian regime to protect them against the Turks.Enraged TrumpMs Pelosi and other senior Democrats walked out of an acrimonious meeting with Mr Trump over the issue last week and accused the president of having an angry “meltdown”.Saturday’s unscheduled visit was in keeping with several overseas delegations led by Ms Pelosi this year that have highlighted gaps between the Trump administration’s position and those held by Congress, including many Republicans.In April, she visited the Irish Border to warn about the risk of a hard Brexit threatening the Belfast Agreement . Trump administration officials have said they would “enthusiastically” back Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.Ms Pelosi and other congressional leaders attended the Munich Security Conference in February. At that forum they delivered reassuring messages to some of the European leaders whom Mr Trump has accused of failing to contribute their share to Nato and the US-led campaign against Isis. – Read full coverage of events here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057121.1571596206!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit labour signals backing for referendum on pm s deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson in the House of Commons during the first Saturday sitting of parliament since 1982. Photograph: Jessica TaylorUK ParliamentAFP via Getty Britain’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has said Labour will back an amendment this week that would put Boris Johnson’s deal to a confirmatory referendum with an option to remain in the European Union.“We have already voted, I think, three times as a party for a second referendum with a three-line whip behind it,” he told the BBC. “The position we have adopted is whatever the outcome, whether it’s Boris Johnson’s bad deal or a better one which could be secured, it has got to go to a referendum up against Remain.”Sir Keir was speaking a day after MPs voted to defer approval of Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal until after the legislation implementing it is passed. The 322-306 majority for former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin’s amendment was made possible by the DUP’s 10 MPs who backed it in defiance of the government.During a five-hour sitting, the first on a Saturday since the start of the Falklands War in 1982, Conservative Brexiteers fell into line behind the prime minister. But DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds quoted back to Mr Johnson his promise never to create a customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland.“It also puts us in the VAT regime. It also puts us in the single market regime for a large part of goods and agrifood, without any consent up front, contrary to the agreement made in December 2017, which said that regulatory difference could happen only with the consent of the Executive and the Assembly. It drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement by altering the cross-community consent mechanism,” said Mr Dodds.RobustThe prime minister defended the deal, pointing out that Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK. And he argued that the requirement for a simple majority in the Stormont Assembly to extend the arrangements after four years was a robust consent mechanism that complied with the terms of the Belfast Agreement.“I do think it a pity that it is thought necessary for one side or the other in the debate in Northern Ireland to have a veto on those arrangements because, after all – and I must be very frank about this – the people of this country have taken a great decision embracing the entire four nations of this country, by a simple majority vote that went 52:48 and which we are honouring now. I think that principle should be applied elsewhere, and I see no reason why it should not be applied in Northern Ireland as well,” he said.Independent Unionist Sylvia Hermon said the deal had caused anger and anxiety among unionists and she called on Mr Johnson to give a public reassurance that nothing in the agreement would undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.“I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who has given a very solemn explanation about his commitment to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. But as a unionist I need to hear a British prime minister making that commitment to the unionist community,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sebastian Smee looks back at the work of Gordon ParksFive months after the inauguration of president John Kennedy, Gordon Parks, the famous photographer for Life magazine, found himself on a plane to Rio de Janeiro. As he cruised along at 30,000 feet, an immense thought pressed in: I am about to save a boy’s life.His name was Flavio da Silva, and he lived in a favela called Catacumba on the steep hillsides of Rio. Days earlier, the boy had written: “This is a dream, and I shall end by awakening.”\u0026nbspBut it wasn’t. It wasn’t a dream. It was his life.Though neither he nor Parks could have foreseen it, Flavio was about to become a pawn in a battle between two media titans: one in the United States, the other in Brazil. Both publications were trying to influence public opinion at a time when the ideological and geopolitical stakes felt frighteningly high.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Life’s circulation at the time was around 7 million copies, the highest in the land, and its Republican-leaning editors weren’t shy about using that influence.\u0026nbspIt was the height of the Cold War. Fidel Castro’s grip on Cuba had tightened after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Latin America looked vulnerable to a communist takeover. Life decided to launch a five-part series titled “Crisis in Latin America”. Parks, the first African American to work as a staff photographer at the magazine, was assigned to the second part.Brazil, like the US, had a new president, Jânio Quadros. Quadros inherited an economy in crisis. He implemented an austerity programme, of which the US approved. But when the United States offered $300m\u0026nbsp(£234m) in foreign aid in return for cooperating with US\u0026nbspopposition to Castro’s Cuba, Quadros rejected it. The offer, he felt, was an insult to Brazil’s autonomy. It was tantamount to a bribe.Life editors liked to script photo assignments in advance. Parks was told to go to the Rio favelas, “find an impoverished father with a family of eight to 10 children. Show how he earns a living. Explore his political leanings. Is he a communist, or about to become one?”They wanted Parks to round out the family shots with images providing some social context: ideally, a political rally in the favelas.Parks had been uneasy about the assignment from the beginning. He had his own ideas. But an ally at Life urged him to accept, saying: “Rio de Janeiro is a long, long way from Rockefeller Plaza. Who knows, you might just misinterpret your instructions?”The first thing was to find a suitable family. Parks went to the favelas on a steaming hot day in March 1961. He was accompanied by José Gallo, who managed the local bureau of Time Inc, Life’s owner. As they climbed up a “tangled maze of shacks”, Parks saw Flavio, who was carrying a 40-pound tin of water on his head and who – he would soon discover – suffered from severe asthma.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His legs looked like sticks covered with skin and screwed into two dirty feet. He stopped for breath, coughing, his chest heaving as the water slopped over his shoulder and distended belly.”Parks had his subject. He met Flavio’s seven siblings in their home, high up the Catacumba hillside, and, that evening, his parents. Flavio’s mother, Nair, worked as a washerwoman. She was 35, and pregnant with their ninth child. His father, José Manuel, was 42. He had a kiosk selling kerosene and detergent.\u0026nbspMunizThe J Paul Getty Museum)Parks had travelled widely – including an earlier trip to Rio – but never had he seen such destitution. He and Gallo explained themselves and asked for permission to carry out their assignment. “You can photograph us,” José replied, eventually, “but you must show us in a good light.”“Just doing my job,” we journalists tell ourselves. The lives we affect, and sometimes rearrange, are rarely changed intentionally. We maintain this stance even when it feels suspiciously convenient, discharging us from the obligation to anticipate consequences.\u0026nbspThen again, some consequences are hard to anticipate.\u0026nbspParks finished his assignment, largely ignoring the instruction to focus on the father and his political leanings. Instead, he focused on Flavio and on Flavio’s brothers and sisters. He kept a diary of his days in the favela. He was there when the children woke up. He photographed them in the rudimentary kitchen. He even took them by car to Copacabana. The famous beach was just 15 minutes away, but they had never seen it, and Parks recorded their euphoric responses.\u0026nbspEach night he left the favela and returned, uneasy, to his room in Copacabana’s upscale Hotel Excelsior. Parks had grown up the youngest of 15 children and the victim of racist bullying. Now a parent himself, he couldn’t help but empathise with Flavio. He wrote of being “filled with confusion and guilt during my final days in Catacumba. Flavio, like thousands of other children, would die\u0026nbsp... I could not help compare the good fortune of my own children with the fate of these others”.But it wasn’t a lie.\u0026nbspPark’s photos appeared in the 16 June 1961, issue of Life under the heading, “Freedom’s Fearful Foe: Poverty.” You can see them in the first room of “Gordon Parks: The Flavio Story”, a riveting show at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The second, third and fourth rooms uncover the bewildering events that the photo essay set in motion.\u0026nbspParks belonged to a generation of photojournalists whose work could get massive exposure. He said he wanted his work “to draw people’s attention to the problems they show” and to play a role in effecting change. An admirer of President Kennedy, he hoped that the new president’s youth and progressive policies would have positive results. But he had seen firsthand, too, that the United States lacked credibility in Latin America. If it wanted to solve problems there, he realised, the United States needed first to “clean up its own yard”.Intimate, observant, poetically suggestive, Parks’s photos of Flavio and his family were the work of an artist. “Far from condescending, they utterly personalised ... and made intimate the tragedy of poverty,” Paul Roth wrote in the show’s terrific catalogue. (Roth’s essay is the source of much of the information in this story). They “punctured”, he said, Life magazine’s “conception of indigence as an abstract lure to an ideological foe” – communism.\u0026nbspParks’s photo essay was one of the most influential Life ever published. It provoked an enormous response from readers, who sent thousands of letters and unsolicited donations. When Life published excerpts from the letters in a subsequent issue, under the headline “A Great Urge to Help Flavio”, it included an appeal for more donations, which Life said it would use to move the Da\u0026nbspSilvas\u0026nbspto a modest new home and to seek medical treatment for Flavio.\u0026nbspParks flew back to Rio on 28 June to deliver the message. To his relief, Flavio’s parents needed no persuading to release Flavio to the care of a hospital in Denver. “Keep him in hospital as long as necessary but please bring him back cured and well,” his father said.\u0026nbspAt Parks’s hotel, Flavio had his first-ever bath (“The water was black,” Parks noted) and donned new clothes that Parks had bought for him. A team of people worked on getting Flavio a visa and on finding a suitable home for his family.The day came for the family to move out of Catacumba. Their story had spread, and a crowd gathered to watch. Parks, who was there to document the day, remembered a woman grabbing his shoulder and saying: “What about us? All the rest of us stay here to die!”\u0026nbspThat same night, Parks and Gallo drove Flavio to the airport,\u0026nbspand all three flew to the United States.In Denver, Flavio was treated at the Children’s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital. Life photographer Carl Iwasaki documented the first days of his life in Denver, including visits to the hospital, first days at school and a visit to an amusement park. The photographs of Flavio 2.0 – designed above all, it can seem, to make America feel good about itself – were published in the magazine’s 21 July issue.\u0026nbspThe repercussions of this intervention went beyond Flavio and his family. Editors at O Cruzeiro, an illustrated weekly in Brazil, took umbrage at Parks’s photo essay (which had appeared in a Spanish-language version of Life, distributed throughout South America).\u0026nbspO Cruzeiro had Brazilian nationalist leanings. Its editors objected to a high-circulation US\u0026nbspmagazine with an explicit political agenda coming to Brazil to point out problems that had not been solved in its own country.\u0026nbspTheir response was impudent, blunt and charged with chutzpah. They sent a photographer of their own, Henri Ballot, to New York City. After photographing the streets of impoverished communities in Spanish Harlem and on the Lower East Side, Ballot homed in on Puerto Rican immigrants Felix and Esther Gonzalez. They lived with their six children in a dilapidated, rat- and cockroach-infested tenement building on Rivington Street.\u0026nbspBallot’s photographs were published in the 7 October 1961 issue of O Cruzeiro. They revealed living conditions every bit as desperate as those of the Da Silvas. One photograph shows a child sleeping with three enormous cockroaches on his bare skin. Another shows a child with a bandage covering a rat bite on his forehead. O Cruzeiro rammed home its point by publishing some of Ballot’s New York images with insets showing Park’s original Rio images.\u0026nbspThe two magazines went to war, each accusing the other of staging its photographs – of, effectively, manufacturing “fake news”. And, as happens routinely in any polarised media environment, real people enduring real predicaments were reduced to pawns in a propaganda war.The ultimate guide to Rio de JaneiroHighway 61: Jessica Lange’s photography explores her midwestern rootsMeanwhile, in Denver, the transition proved tricky for Flavio. He struggled at school. But things slowly settled down. He learned English, adapted his behaviour and spent weekends with a Portuguese-speaking family, the Gonçalves. Over time, he had less and less contact with his family back in Rio. And when the treatment neared its conclusion after two full years, he was desperate to remain.\u0026nbspHe begged Parks and the Gonçalves to adopt him. Instead, in July 1963, Flavio returned to Rio, where he stayed briefly with his family before being sent to a boarding school in São Paulo. The schooling was arranged and paid for by Life.\u0026nbspParks maintained contact with Flavio after the boy’s return to Brazil, and in 1978, he published a book (Flavio) about the experience, which brought him back to Rio to gather material. Parks also visited in 1999 to film a documentary (Gordon Parks – Half Past Autumn). In each of those trips, the journalist saw that his subject’s struggles with poverty had never really abated.\u0026nbsp“As a photojournalist,” Parks wrote, with more than a tinge of melancholy, “I have occasionally done stories that have seriously altered human lives. In hindsight, I often wonder if it might not have been wiser to have left those lives untouched, to have let them grind out their time as fate intended.”Flavio himself, now retired from his job as a security guard, later reflected on the fact that, thanks to Parks, “people know more about my life than I do. I’m glad that I’m alive as a result ... (But) this story never made me feel either better or worse than anyone else.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He didn’t say it’s despicable, which I just say it is.”Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move.

But why do we have to choose?A number of Marvel actors and filmmakers have since criticised Scorsese’s opinion, with Samuel L Jackson stating it is “like saying Bugs Bunny ain’t funny. Films are films.”s of the Galaxy director James Gunn expressed sadness over Scorsese’s stance, tweeting: “Martin Scorsese is one of my five favourite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I’m saddened that he’s now judging my films in the same way.”Appearing on The Howard Stern Show, Robert Downey Jr took a less outraged stance, stating: “I appreciate his opinion because I think it’s like anything, we need all of the perspectives so we can come to the centre and move on.”Along with the\u0026nbspGodfather\u0026nbsptrilogy, Coppola has directed films including\u0026nbspApocalypse Now,\u0026nbspThe Conversation\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspBram Stoker’s Dracula.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their job is to fix a broken part of the station’s solar power network.NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring, but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go.This is Ms Koch’s fourth spacewalk and a first for Ms Meir, who has become the 15th woman to venture out of the ISS and into the vacuum.It is expected to last five-and-a-half hours.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe duo were assisted by Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency, who is also the mission commander, and Nasa Flight Engineer Andrew Morgan.The astronauts exited from the space station’s the Quest airlock after their spacesuits were set to battery power.Ms Koch was the first to leave the hatch followed by Ms Meir.Nasa reveals new spacesuits ahead of humanity’s return to the MoonThey will replace a battery unit on the Port 6 truss structure – the attachment points for external payloads received by the ISS – that stopped working after new lithium-ion batteries were installed on the space station last week.There have been 227 spacewalkers since the first spacewalk in 1965 and all of them have included a male astronaut or cosmonaut.The US space agency had originally planned an all-female spacewalk in March – which included Ms Koch and fellow astronaut Anne McClain – but had to cancel it because of a shortage of medium-size suits.Ms McClain originally thought a large-size spacesuit would be fit for purpose but later concluded that a medium would be safer.She returned to Earth in June and Nasa sent a second medium-size spacesuit up to the station earlier this month.Spacesuits are made of many interchangeable parts – designed to accommodate astronauts with widely varying body sizes.Body measurements of each astronaut are taken and plotted against the size ranges available for each spacesuit component. The suits are then assembled – usually four months prior to flight.While there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\u0026nbspBoth Ms Koch and Ms Meir are wearing medium-size suits, with Ms Koch’s spacesuit featuring red stripes.In a recent interview, Ms Koch spoke about the significance of this spacewalk, saying: “I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing.“In the past women haven’t always been at the table.“It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space programme at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role.“That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell.”Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.Both are members of Nasa’s Astronaut Class of 2013.Ms Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with an expected total of 328 days in space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The prototypes we developed propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.”While the concept of artificial skin has been explored in the field of robotics as scientists attempt to develop robots that look and act like humans, the researchers said they were more interested in working with everyday devices.Dr Roudaut added: “We have seen many works trying to augment humans with parts of machines, here we look at the other way around and try to make the devices we use every day more like us, ie, human-like.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I always thought my first time in London would be for sightseeing. Not because the country was in existential crisis.”The march route, for what it’s worth, took in Trafalgar Square, Marble Arch and the Houses of Parliament. “So I suppose I did get to see a few sights,” she added. “Two birds, one stone, and all that.”Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters

1982, this vast rally outside was the physical embodiment of what campaigners say is the ever-growing support – and necessity – for a Final Say People’s Vote to resolve Brexit once and for all.Supporters came – young and old, Labour and Tory, by train and by coach – from the four corners of the UK to listen to speakers, including Sadiq Khan, Jo Swinson and Star Trek legend Patrick Stewart, make the case for another referendum. They came wearing blue and yellow, and waving EU flags. One arrived, uniquely perhaps, with a saucepan lid and wooden spoon.Double humiliation for Johnson over BrexitLive: PM to seek extension as Letwin amendment delays Brexit voteSenior figures break with Corbyn to declare Labour a Remain partyHundreds of thousands protest at Westminster to demand Final Say voteDiane Abbott and Jacob Rees-Mogg among MPs abused after Brexit voteBercow ready to sign extension letter to Brussels if asked“For making a noise,” explained 70-year-old Marian Hemsted, from Sevenoaks in Kent, banging them together by way of demonstration. “We want them to hear us in parliament and get the message.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThere was perhaps not quite the carnival atmosphere of previous rallies.There were drumming bands, painted faces and a bloke dishing out free vegetarian curries on route (it was nice). There was one woman, Tanya Hall, dressed as an EU fairy: “I made my wings using old coat hangers, tights and blue car spray from the back of the garage,” the 51-year-old said. “It represents how wonderful the EU is.”But, with a referendum appearing to be somehow simultaneously both closer and further away than ever, there was also a sense of urgency, anger and purpose – among both the crowd and the speakers.“I’ve never seen a greater contrast between a political system that’s blocked and broken, versus the energy and clarity that comes from you all marching peacefully through the streets today,” Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent, said during his speech. “The importance of giving you – giving everyone – the Final Say has never been clearer.”ChristofilouThe Independent )Others, including Michael Heseltine and Diane Abbott, were cheered as they riffed on other familiar themes: that Britain would be poorer out the EU, that the original referendum was built on lies, that Boris Johnson couldn’t be trusted with a pair of scissors, let alone the well-being of an entire country.Sandi Toksvig compared him to a dodgy used car salesman who had sold the public a broken vehicle from – wait for it – the “Nigel garage”.If that joke got a cheer, it was nothing compared to the reaction when the big screens showed live footage of the Letwin amendment being passed in the House of Commons – essentially making a Brexit delay more likely. Rarely can a vote in parliament have been greeted with such a roar. It was not dissimilar, one imagines, to how a world cup winning England goal might be greeted.“The whole referendum was built on lies,” said 71-year-old Felicity Goodall, who had been walking with three generations of her family. “No one told us anything about the consequences of leaving the EU or the mess it would get us into for three years. We were hoodwinked then and we’re being left voiceless now – and that can’t be allowed to happen.”London Brexit march to be built on northern people powerIt would, as it happens, have been four generations of her family marching but her 97-year-old father, Stephen Goodall, who attended both previous London rallies – one last November and one in March – had come down with a cold on Friday.“He’s devastated he can’t be here again,” she said. “But he’s here in spirit. He is desperate to see the UK remain. He says the EU is the reason there has been 70 years of peace in Europe, and he should know. He fought in World War Two and was in the army for 30 years after.”As ever at these rallies there were plenty of placards. They ranged from the poetic (“Let’s stay with the stars”) to the risque: “No one consented to this BJ”, read one.Kate Chacksfield’s homemade effort declared her to be “middle aged and slightly miffed”.“It’s the first sign I’ve ever made,” the 52-year-old mother-of-three, of London, said. “But I think, increasingly, I’m more than miffed. I’m angry by it all. Being in the EU brings so many opportunities – economically and culturally – and we are throwing away those opportunities so our children can’t enjoy them.”She would not stop campaigning, she said, until the decision was reversed – nor was she alone in this.Asked what they would do if a deal was passed and the UK did, indeed, leave the EU, most were defiant.“I’d start campaigning to re-enter,” said Alan Wheeler, a 50-year-old trade association director from Maidstone. “I think all this energy and anger that you see today, it won’t just disappear. People won’t just accept it if we leave. They will campaign to become a member again. These rallies will continue now until, one way or another, Brexit is no more. It is too important to just let go.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Last month, it was 20 per cent, but experts fear\u0026nbspthe figure could be even higher this month.Seasonal workers have been put off by the devaluation of sterling following the Brexit referendum and have left for jobs in other EU countries such as Germany,\u0026nbspNetherlands\u0026nbspand Denmark, the union said.\u0026nbspOn the Brexit effect, Ms Capper said: “It has been about making people feel like they are not welcome here.“It has been about question marks in terms of future status:\u0026nbsp‘Can I come back next year? Will I need a passport? Can I continue to come on my work card? Will I get stopped at the border?’“Brexit has put a lot of question marks in the minds of EU nationals. The shortages have increased every year since the referendum. The difficulty to recruit – primarily from Romania and Bulgaria – has become really really hard in the last few years. It has got harder every year.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re not saving enough to finance our pensions or care for the elderly, or to finance infrastructure.Although he claimed that Britain was “in the middle of the worst political and constitutional crisis for arguably several hundred years”, Lord King downplayed the impact Brexit could have on the UK and world economies.UK shares fall as US economy flags, trade and Brexit tensions riseMore than 100,000 sign letter demanding Final Say on Brexit“The decision to leave the EU is not likely to have a major impact on the UK economy in any way... I think there’s an awful lot of bogus quantification going on to justify positions held for other reasons,” he said.\u0026nbsp“I don’t honestly believe that Brexit has any great significance even for the rest of Europe, let alone the rest of the world. I don’t think the long-run economic consequences of the UK leaving the EU are particularly large.”But he warned the global economy was in “great stagnation”, having grown more slowly and for a longer period than before the Great Depression of the 1930s, with levels of debt higher than they were before the 2008 financial crash.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

election.The Labour leader, who has suggested he will sit on the fence if the referendum is held, chose not to walk the few yards from the Houses of Parliament to address the rally.::\u0026nbspSign

frustrating Boris Johnson’s hopes of passing his deal – which was greeted with huge cheers.Labour’s big-hitters arrived soon afterwards, Ms Abbott telling the gathering in parliament square: “I’m a

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is Grade A cobblers.The biggest, most definitive survey in three years shows  per cent back Leavewith  Remain and eight “don’t knows”.But by an even bigger margin,  to , the public wants the  result enacted.Which might also explain why the Tories are  points ahead in another poll and Boris Johnson leads as “best PM” in every single region, class and age category including even the -s.A second referendum would inflict catastrophe on our ided country.Those MPs who champion it out of myopic loyalty to Remain will, we hope, be kicked out whenever an election comes.Good riddance to the lot.THE multi-millionaire luvvies of the Hypocrites’ Rebellion have excelled themselves.We are now seriously invited to consider them victims “stuck in the fossil fuel economy”. The poor poppets!So it’s not their fault they own multiple homes and cars, make millions in a “high-carbon” business and flit around the world in first class or on private jets. Nor that their carbon footprint is incalculably higher than millions of lesser mortals too poor to drive let alone fly.The system is to blame — not the luxuries they definitely won’t be giving up.We assume then that it’s not Lewis Hamilton’s fault he thrashes petrol cars for a living while demanding everyone  gives up meat to save the planet. The Monte Carlo-based F ace is just helplessly trapped in the fossil fuel economy.But these cosseted showbiz clowns cap it all by urging us to ignore their jaw-dropping hypocrisy because the “real story” is that the planet is dying.Who told them that  IPCC scientists  Er, no. Greta Thunberg, the -year-old the luvvies inexplicably “cannot ignore”.They are wrong in so many ways. Not least in thinking the media wants them silenced. We enjoy their witterings enormously. And, luckily, the public doesn’t listen to stars’ woke sermons.Otherwise Corbyn would already be in power and we would all be eating our pets.THE Sun will always oppose nanny state meddling. But we have a soft spot for calorie counts on menus.Why  Because they’re not a big imposition on big restaurant chains or customers.They do provide the latter with a useful steer on what they’re eating.Who knows  They might actually work. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it. One source jokes that MPs will be “voting on an election every day until they crack”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not an easy tightrope to negotiate, and this wasn’t a simple tour for Kate or William for so many reasons.Obviously, security has had to be incredibly tight, far more so than even they are used to, and both of them will have had a full, and possibly rather alarming, briefing from British security services.Then there’s the bittersweet emotional impact on William, who has been retracing his mother’s footsteps during this trip.Diana visited Pakistan several times as a guest of the now Prime Minister Imran Khan and his then we Jemima Goldsmith. She also fell deeply in love with Pakistani-born surgeon Hasnat Khan, and the country and its people always held a special place in her heart.William would have felt very close to his mum as he reconnected with Imran Khan and then went to the same cancer hospital in Lahore that Diana visited just a year before her death.Kate paid her own tribute with a series of stunning outfits subtly taking inspiration from Diana. It’s at times like these that William must miss his mum, and all credit to him for being able to remember her with love and affection, rather than sorrow and trauma.The show-stopping moment for me was when the royal couple emerged from a highly decorated tuk tuk for a glittering reception in Islamabad.Kate was wearing the most stunning emerald gown I think I have ever seen.It was Oscar red carpet-worthy, andthere aren’t copies on the high street for our Christmas parties very soon I will not be best pleased.She looked equally gorgeous a couple of days later playing cricket while wearing a cream shalwar kameez and white trainers.Kate has quietly and effectively emerged as the Queen’s top asset in the Royal Family.Camilla will obviously never have anything like the same respect and affection as Her Majesty, but skipping a generation, Kate has all the attributes to be a very effective Monarch one day at William’s side. She’s bright, beautul and has a big big heart.Since becoming a mum of three, Kate is a much more confident charity ambassador and public speaker, and she’s developed a real connection with all of the children she meets, putting them at ease and making them smile.If the Royal Family is to survive it will all be down to this quiet but determined woman. It’s a heavy burden to place on such slim shoulders, but Kate is more than up to it.THE late Leah Bracknell might have had terminal cancer, but she lived le to the full.The Emmerdale star, who played Zoe Tate for  years and whose death was announced this week, laughed, loved and seized the day.She didn’t do many interviews, but came in to talk to me on my show a couple of years ago after her diagnosis.Leah was funny, brave and determined not to be defined by her illness. She described herself as a “cancer rebel” and we were overwhelmed with ­messages of support and respect for this remarkable woman.She lived and died on her own terms and will be sadly missed.It will be incredible to have the teeniest, tiniest idea of what incredible people such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and our own Helen Sharman and Tim Peake experienced.For a lelong space geek like me, who watched the moon landings and wanted to be part of the crew of Star Trekthis is the trip of a letime.Will tell you all about it when I’m back.WHAT the hell do these clowns calling themselves environmental “warriors” hope to achieve by targeting hard-working people trying to get to work in the morning Scenes on the London Tube this week were deeply disturbing and frightening, andExtinction Rebellion don’t get a grip, someone is going to get seriously hurt – or even killed.At least they have admitted it was a spectacular own goal to pick on the eco-friendly electric underground, especially during rush hour.They know full well such stupidity has alienated many potential sympathisers.Violence can never be condoned, but I completely understand the sheer frustration of men and women who just wanted to get to their jobs on time, and who took action by pulling a demonstrator off the roof of a train as he kicked out.At one point it was like a chilling scene from a horror film.Most of us agree we need to take action to reverse the effects of climate change before it’s too late, but these sorts of daft demos are not the way to win hearts and minds.As well as being disruptive for the sake of it, such inflammatory actions are potentially extremely dangerous.Believe me, there IS such a thing as bad publicity and although we might be talking about Extinction Rebellion, we aren’t discussing the importance and far bigger picture of global warming.I just don’t expect to see such toxic scenes in the UK, and far from being “warriors”, these idiots are best described as another word beginning with W. And I think we all know which one that is.There are many twists and turns, but suffice to say Arnie is back with some hilariously deadpan zingers, the special effects are in a league of their own, andyou don’t shed a tear at the end you are an unfeeling terminator machine.SCOTT MITCHELL is one of the loveliest men in all of the world. He is having to watch his beloved we Barbara Windsor slowly dissolve in front of his eyes due to the s****y disease that is Alzheimer’s.He has been by her side every step of the way and is now full-time carer for a woman who was once the epitome of independence and the le and soul of the party. This week Scott confessed that he feels “racked with guilt”he leaves his beloved Barbara alone even for a few hours.Scott is fiercely protective of the woman he adores and so patient when the illness has her confused and endlessly repeating herself. He and Barbara have raised thousands of pounds for Alzheimer’s charities as well as vital awareness of the disease.I really just want to give Scott a massive hug, tell him he’s doing a brilliant job and he has absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Obviously It’s desperately sad that our Barbara is going through such a hellish time, but she struck gold when she met and married her Scott.Vile trolls sending death threats to head judge Shirley Ballas after Radio  DJ Dev was booted off the show last weekend really need to take a long, hard look at themselves.You might have vehemently disagreed with their decision and thrown your popcorn, crisps and prosecco at the TV – or was that just me  – when Dianne and Dev danced their last, but can we just hold on and try to put it all into perspective  It’s a wonderful, warm, fuzzy show that is supposed to be pure entertainment.What in the name of Len Goodman is going on when a couple being voted off a TV show ends up causing such pain and distress to a lovely woman like Shirley Strictly stupid, silly and sad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is desperate stuff. Those rights would be set by any Government voters elect. And there are no votes in tearing up rights.Other Labour MPs contort logic by claiming Boris’s deal is a “Trojan Horse to No Deal”. It is just dishonest.They claimed their only fear was No Deal. Now a deal is here, they oppose it.At least the DUP has a solid objection. But they should rethink. We believe they are making a historic mistake. So does ex-First Minister David Trimble, Nobel Prize-winning author of the Good Friday Agreement. He backs the deal.All MPs must put aside self-interest now. This deal is a clever compromise they can unite around. Labour moderates in Leave seats fear reprisals from Corbyn’s mob — but they need the same courage a few have already shown.They will be heroes to their constituentsthey make the right call.Since  pompous Remainer pundits have loved to declare Brexit “undeliverable”. It was always nonsense. Boris and the EU will deliver it. Only Remainers’ intransigence stands in the way.They should know this: Voters won’t blame Boris nowBrexit isn’t done. Those days are over. They will blame those who snatched it away and put their own tribal interests first. MPs must instead do the right thing today:Defeat Letwin’s ill-disguised vandalism.

He has  phone numbers to contact the duke.”Fistens claims will be explored in a Channel  Dispatches programme, due to be broadcast tomorrow, that sheds more light on Epstein and Andrews friendship.There have been a long string of allegations made against Andrew since Epsteins death.The financiers alleged sex slave Virginia Roberts claims she had sex with the prince aged  - which he strongly denies.Ms Roberts, , who now uses the surname Giuffre, had her claims against the royal thrown out by a judge who deemed them “immaterial” to her defamation case against madam Ghislaine Maxwell.Dispatches reveals Ms Roberts was allegedly taken to a hospital in New York suffering from intimate bleeding, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and sharp, low abdominal pain”.Medical records seen by the newspaper show she checked in on July  - three months after she claims she had sex with Andrew on Epsteins paedo island.Andrew was infamously pictured with his arm around Ms Roberts at Ms Maxwells home in London in .Fisten said: Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey’s pimp.

We have the means and ability to do so.We must leave by October .It came as:Mr Gove revealed the risk of leaving with No Deal has increased as they cannot guarantee that the EU will grant an extension.He said he would chair a Cabinet committee meeting today to ensure the next stage of No Deal preparations is in place.It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer, he said - the Governments full plan for leaving without a deal.We are preparing to ensure thatno extension is granted, that we have done everything possible in order to leave without a deal.The Cabinet minister said the only reason Boris asked for a delay was because he was forced to - not because he wanted to.He added: The extension letter was sent because Parliament required it to be sent. But Parliament cant change the Prime Ministers mind, Parliament cant change the Governments policy.Parliament has a chance in the days ahead to pass the deal Boris Johnson has brought back from Brussels - and the EU was waiting to see what happens before granting a delay or not, he said.There is no profit in delay for anyone, he added. We know the EU want us to leave.We need to get this done.This morning Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab echoed his comments, and told the BBC this morning: Yes, I am confident that we will be [out of the EU by October .]Both ministers said they were sure they now had the numbers now to pass the deal after Boris won a surge of support from Tories and Labour MPs yesterday.We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons, Mr Raab said earlier.Ex-Tory rebel Amber Rudd today revealed she would back Boris deal.She told Sky: I support the Prime Minister’s deal and I have told him I will support it next week.EU ambassadors this morning met to discuss what would have been Boris sealed Brexit deal,it had been voted through yesterday.They didnt discuss any delay at the -minute meeting.Instead they will give Boris a vital  hour leline to seehe can win a vote on his deal, before actively considering his request for a delay.Its now unlikely that Brussels will formally respond until after the Bill goes to the Commons on Tuesday, heaping pressure on Parliament to vote for the deal.The EU can grant Boris request for an extension right up until October they want to, but are working with No to try and push MPs into backing the deal.The PM outlined yesterday how Brussels could reject the delay as they are also aiming for Britain to leave the EU on Halloween.Mr Johnson pointed out that as the EU leaders have made it clear they do not want more delay they could well throw it out.Yesterday a vote on Boris deal was scrapped after the rebel Letwin amendment passed.But ministers have plans for a meaningful vote to happen tomorrow instead.The Speaker could scupper those plans by arguing that its the same motion that was brought forward yesterday, but was abandoned when Tory MPs left the Commons in droves.However, Brexit still wont be secured until the Withdrawal Bill goes through the Commons, which could take days or weeks.Only when the Bill gets passed into law will Boris finally be able to relax.Is the deal dead : No. Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs yesterday the Government would hope to give them another meaningful vote on Mr Johnson’s Brussels deal as early as tomorrow.Downing Street has said the legislation — the Withdrawal Agreement Bill — will be introduced this week. Treasury Minister Simon Clarke insisted: “We will get this done next week.”Are we going to crash out with No Deal : MPs backing the Letwin amendment say it offers an insurance policy against leaving the EU without a deal on October .However, it does cast doubt over leaving by the October  deadline as scrutiny of the ­legislation drags on.Will the EU agree to an extension : All  EU states will decide on what extension to offer but it could be either shorter or longer than the three-month one envisaged by the Benn Act.They could respond to the letter but wait to seethe Government can get its withdrawal legislation through next week. It could lead to an EU emergency summit on October .Operation Yellowhammer is the Governments contingency plan in the event of a No Deal Brexit.It was created in June  as a way for the Government to take control and quickly co-ordinate with dferent agencies to handle any short-term disruption.It covered  areas including energy, food, water, transport and healthcare.The operation was based on the worst-case scenario assumptionsthe UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal.An Operation Yellowhammer dossier was leaked to The Sunday Times on August , claiming the UK could face months of disruptionThe dossier revealed:This morning the DUP issued another threat that they would do all they could to frustrate Boris Brexit deal going through the House of Commons.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said: In nearly half of all votes on the issue in Parliament it has been DUP MPs who have ensured progress continued to be made towards our exit from the EU.The DUP wants to “get Brexit done” but it must be a Brexit for the whole of the United Kingdom. Our position has been clear and it has been consistent.We want to leave as one nation. That remains our goal.

such as the Lib Dems.Sir Keir also said the door was open to discussions with the DUP about backing amendments to Boris deal.The fuming Northern Irish party has said it wont back Boris agreement as they think it breaks the UK up.Yesterday they warned they would examine all amendments this week carefully in a threat to the PM they may work together with the Opposition to frustrate things further.Labour has already whipped its MPs multiple times to back a second vote, but no attempts have succeeded so far.When askedthe Labour front bench would back the amendment for another vote, Sir Keir said: That is the clear policy.But it is unclear what Jeremy Corbyn himself thinks of the plan.Last week he said he would caution MPs against backing the PMs Brexit deal, eventhere were a referendum attached.Many MPs rebelled against him yesterday on the Letwin amendment and refused to back it.Two Labour backbenchers put forward a second referendum amendment to Boris deal yesterday, but it was never voted on.Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey said of the news today: If this is true, then there will be fewer Labour Party members and thousands fewer Labour voters the day after this is tabled.And John Mann, who is poised to back Boris deal too, said: Not everyone in Labour will back it, I can assure you.Quizzed on his ambitions, he admitted there is a “very strong case” for Labour to finally have its first female leader.He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I’m clearly not a woman and I don’t think that’s going to change any time soon.”But Sir Keir – a former barrister and head of the Crown Prosecution Service - refused to rule himself out.Pressed onhe will run, he said he was “not going to start answering” about his leadership ambitions.He added: “I’m not even discussing that, I’m  per cent behind Jeremy Corbyn.“I am working with Jeremy Corbyn to try to win the next general election.“I think what’s most important is that we build on what we’ve got at the moment and we build on that  manesto that was so popular in our movement.”Sir Keir is one of the favourites to replace Mr Corbyn when he stands down.Labour Remainers are a big fan of his as he has been key in shting the party towards backing a second referendum,But the leadership is desperate to see a committed Corbynista installed at the top of the party.And last week Mr McDonnell threw his backing behind a woman being the next leader, suggesting it could be Angela Rayner.Meanwhile Labour MPs hit out at the abuse they had received for being willing to vote for Boris Johnsons Brexit deal.Lucy Powell slammed the hatred some colleagues had been getting as absolutely appalling.She told Sky News earlier that many MPs were trying to reconcile themselves with their constituents, who had wanted to leave the EU.They are trying to respect that outcome, and they are vilied for doing so, Ms Powell stormed.It shouldn’t be an extreme position should it to say look, we’ve had a referendum, the result was something that I didn’t campaign for and many of us in the Labour party didn’t campaign for but the result was what it was which was a huge turnout and people voted to leave the EU and we have to try and respect that.She said she was really worried about the party appearing to turn their backs on communities that voted leave and appearing to say sorry, your voice doesnt matter anywmore.She said that telling them actually, we thought you were a bit ill-informed and we thought you were a bit racist and thats why were are going to ignore you was the wrong message to send.Threats to deselect MPs who voted for the Brexit deal had appalled her, she added.We all just need to take a step back here, it requires compromise.... it requires us to respect each others opinions."},{"url":null,"title":"nada farhoud new cites animal","story":"NewsopinionNada Farhoud: New CITES animal export ban may not be enough to protect wildleA new ban on capture and export of wildle doesnt take effect until the end of November, so unscrupulous animal dealers are taking full advantage of the time left to ply their tradeShareCommentsByNada Farhoud:,  OCT NewsopinionCITES ban on export cant come too soon -

The animals, some as young as two, are believed to have been forcibly separated from their parents in the wild and have been at the centre of a legal battle since footage of them being held in pens in the Hwange National Park emerged in February. Conservationists say calves can be entirely dependent on their mothers for emotional and physical support until they are five. Others can still be taking their mother’s milk until they are  or another sibling is born.    It was thought their fate was saved when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species , the organisation that sets worldwide rules on the sale of wild animals and their products, voted to stop these captures and exports. But as the ban doesn’t take effect until the end of November, sources now say Zimbabwe Parks are gearing up to export the elephants in that small window of time. News of the imminent export comes two years after  calves were flown to China, creating an international outcry. Hwange National Park is also the site of the killing of Cecil the lion in  by an American trophy hunter. In the past few years, Zimbabwe has made £million from the sale of  elephants to zoos, parks and other tourist attractions in China and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Campaigners willto a Scottish court tomorrow - where they could attempt to establishthe stunt was in contempt of court. The Prime Minister last night sent a a legally-required request to the EU for a Brexit extension after losing a vote in Parliament. But he refused to sign it - saying he was only sending it at Parliamentaposs bidding - and sent a second signed note branding an extension corrosive.SNP MP Joanna Cherry said the PM had previously pledged not to defy or frustrate the law, and it looks like heaposs breaking both promises. She added an existing case around the issue was due for its next hearing in the Inner House of Edinburghaposs Court of Session on Monday. Campaigning QC Jo Maugham, who is also involved in the case, tweeted: The hearing tomorrow will go ahead. The PM has made the request for an extension he promised he wouldnapost make, the EU is considering that request. And the question whether the PM and Advocate General for Scotland are in contempt of court is one for the Inner House. It came after Labour warned the spoilt brat and childish PM could be in contempt of court. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: “He may well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts themselves because he’s clearly trying to undermine the first letter and not signing the letter. He’s behaving a bit like a spoilt brat. Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it. And this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first - I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided.”    Both Mr McDonnell and Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Prime Ministeraposs behaviour could end up being challenged in court. Sir Keir - the former Director of Public Prosecutions - told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: I’m sure there will be court proceedings. But the first thing we’re going to do in Parliament is deal with that issue. The second thing is thenhe brings in a Bill to implement his deal we will fight amendments on that because the deal is a very very bad deal and it has within it a trapdoor to no deal at the end of next year.  Branding the PM childlike, Sir Keir said: The law is very clear he should have signed one letter in accordance with the law. He’s being childlike andI donapost think it’ll happen butwe crash out because of what he’s done with the letters in  days’ time without a deal he bears personal responsibility for that. That’s the first fight. Askedthe behaviour could be challenged in court, Mr McDonnell added: It may well be. Others will decide that matter. But a number of lawyers have already commented that this is seeking to undermine a decision of Parliament and therefore flies in the face of both Parliament and court decisions.”  Even Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was “not very prime ministerial”. A senior No source told the SundayRemain campaigners will say this is illegal [but] we donapost think it is. But a former Tory Cabinet minister told the Observer it was against the spirit of the Benn Act”, the law which forced him to ask for a delay. The ex-minister said: “I think this will end up in the courts again. It will also put government law officers in a very uncomfortable position.    Two weeks ago, Scotlandaposs Court of Session ruled against campaigners who wanted an order to stop Boris Johnson frustrating the delay request with a second letter. The UK government won over the court by finally promising, in writing, that it would obey the Benn Act after all. Campaigners could now argue that, in effect, Mr Johnson did not obey the law. One prominent Remainer told the Mirror Scotlandaposs Court of Session is due to sit again tomorrow, but there is a dference of opinion. There appear to be two genuine sets of views about the second letter, they said. One is the second letter is unlawful, the other is that it’s legally irrelevant. Either way everyone agrees the legally signicant one is the first one and the EU will just ignore the other. They added: The fact the Benn letter is unsigned is a total red herring and childish behaviour by Johnson.  Meanwhile, Michael Gove said the Government had triggered the next stage of Operation Yellowhammer no-deal plans because the Letwin amendment had increased the chances of leaving without a pact. No hopes to stage another Meaningful Vote tomorrow on his Withdrawal Agreement,Commons Speaker John Bercow gives the go-ahead. But Mr McDonnell said another vote would be “pointless” and a “political stunt”. The PM received a boost when former Tory Cabinet Minister Amber Rudd revealed she would back his deal. Downing Street is expected to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament today, with debates beginning on Tuesday. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer indicated Labour would back an amendment for a second referendum. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.

First of all, the Prime Minister might still get his deal through Parliament in time for the deadline, wiping out the need for delay. And secondly, a final decision on whether to delay Brexit hasnapost been made yet - itaposs in  EU leadersapos hands.The Prime Minister and his ally Michael Gove have insisted they can still get Brexit through by October , and even claim no-deal is still possible.Mr Gove has chaired a meeting of the no-deal planning committee and claimed he is triggering emergency plan Operation Yellowhammer. So are their claims actually true Here we analyse how Boris Johnson might still be able to aposget Brexit doneapos by October  - and where it might fall through. Yes. Despite Boris Johnson asking for a delay, the date of October  may still happen. It all depends on two things - whether Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal gets through the Commons, and whether EU leaders agree to grant a delay.MPs voted to delay Brexit on Saturday, but that was a delaywhether or notBoris Johnson actually gets his deal into law.If his deal gets through by next Thursday, there wonapost be any need for a delay - unless itaposs a technical extension while final parts are ratied by, say, the European Parliamnet. So we can end up leaving the EU much earlier. If the deal doesnapost get through, then itaposs in the hands of  EU leaders whoaposd have to agree unanimously at an emergency summit.They can either choose to refuse a delay - forcing a no-deal Brexit at pm on Halloween - or grant one even though Boris Johnson doesnapost want it.When will the PM try to get his Brexit deal through   The Government is set to bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed for Brexit - to the Commons on Tuesday. However, time is running out before the October  deadline because the European Parliament would also need to raty it. And the Bill would have to pass through MPsapos first vote , dozens of amendments including for a customs union and second referendum, and the pro-Remain House of Lords. Ministers could try to hold extra late-night or weekend sittings in Parliamentto get the legislation through.Separately, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Government wants to hold another meaningful vote on Mr Johnsonaposs deal on Monday.This wouldnapost be a final decision but it would indicatehe has the numbers. Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would consider whether to allow the Governmentaposs plans. Will the Brexit deal pass in the Commons   The vote is on a kne-edge.In the current hung Parliament, much will hinge on the PM securing support from Brexiteer Tories who voted down Theresa Mayaposs deal on three occasions, plus the  former Conservatives who lost the whip over the issue of a no deal Brexit .Former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd has indicated she would support Mr Johnsonaposs deal and thought there was a coalition for getting the Prime Ministeraposs deal through.However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he believes the Government does have enough backing, telling The Andrew Marr Show: We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons. The DUP is strongly opposed to Mr Johnsonaposs deal due to the arrangements for Northern Ireland, so the backing of enough Labour MPs in Leave supporting seats will also be vital.  Does Boris Johnson want a delay   Despite asking for one, no, he doesnapost. The Prime Minister sent a a legally-required request to the EU to delay until January , deal or no deal, after a vote in Parliament and a law called the aposBenn Actapos forced him to.But he refused to sign the letter and sent a second signed note which branded an extension corrosive.That means even though heaposs legally asked for a delay, politically, EU leaders must choose to listen either to him or to the UK Parliament. Tough choice.  Itaposs widely thought EU leaders would agree an extension to avoid no-deal despite doubts raised by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. However, it seems we wonapost get a decision straight away.reported the EU would wait and see how things pan out in Parliament before announcing how to proceed. If the PM gets the Bill through, there could be a special gathering of EU leaders on October . If the deal needs more time at that stage to get through Parliament, leaders could agree to a short technical extension.    Would any delay definitely be three months  No, not necessarily. First of all, an extension - however long - ends once a Brexit deal is ratied. Soitaposs all done  days into the period, Brexit can happen then. Secondly, EU leaders could decide a dferentto an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn Act. One ally of Angela Merkel suggested it should be much longer to avoid having to just extend again from January .    Will Boris Johnson be forced to accept an extension Yes -MPs do not vote it down in Parliament.That is, at least, according to the terms of the Benn Act which the PM could try to subvert or somehow get around. Why did a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal not go ahead on Saturday  MPs voted by a majority of  to back an amendment put forward by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin to withhold approval of the latest deal agreed between Mr Johnson and Brussels unless and until implementing legislation is passed. Sir Oliver, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the Government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was insurance against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of October . After he lost the vote, the Prime Minister decided not to have the so-called meaningful vote on his deal. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill.

Last night the Prime Minister wrote to Brussels asking for a three-month extension to the October  deadline - whether or not he gets a deal. But he refused to sign it - and also sent a second, signed letter saying he doesnapost want to delay at all. Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: I told the Prime Minister to obey the law and despite his petulant posturing and bluster he finally has - heaposs asked for an extension. His damaging deal was defeated. It comes after MPs backed another delay to Brexit instead of holding a straight up-and-down vote on the Tory leaderaposs deal with Brussels. The showdown on aposSuper Saturdayapos - as Parliament sat for the first time on a weekend since  - happened at the same time as aposa millionapos protesters marched outside demanding a second referendum. But in reality, the can might only be kicked down the road for a few weeks.And crucially the Brexit deal - the thing we should all really be talking about - could still be passed in a matter of days. So how can all these things be true at the same time  Hereaposs an explanation of what happened on Saturday - and what happens next.  Boris Johnson lost a historic House of Commons vote - which meant he was legally obliged to ask for a Brexit delay by pm on Saturday. Hereaposs how it worked. The Prime Minister had wanted to force MPs into a straight meaningful vote on his Brexit deal. That would have either accepted or rejected it - end of story. Anditaposd been accepted, it would have locked in a legal countdown to October . But instead, MPs voted - for an amendment to withhold approval for the Brexit deal, unless and until every part of it has passed into UK law. Sir Oliver Letwin, the ringleader, insisted he wasnapost trying to scupper Brexit - merely setting up an insurance policy to prevent no-deal by accident. But the consequence is we still didnapost have a Brexit deal by pm on Saturday. Thataposs a legal deadline laid down under a law called the Benn Act. The Benn Act said Boris Johnson must send a letter to the EU asking for a three-month delay to Brexit,there was no agreement by pm.    Has Boris Johnson asked for a Brexit delay  Yes. Last night, humiliated Boris Johnson sent the extension letter he vowed to die in a ditch rather than send. The letter is a word-for-word copy and paste of the request MPs ordered him to make as part of the Benn Act. He didnapost sign it, but that doesnapost actually make any dference. Itaposs just a political protest. It doesnapost have any legal effect. Hereaposs the first letter:  Meanwhile the Prime Minister did sign a second letter - effectively telling EU leaders to IGNORE the first and he will get Brexit done by the do or die October  deadline he set himself. It says a delay would be corrosive adding: I remain confident that we will complete that process by  October. And it says: Many of those who voted against the Government today have indicated their support for the new deal and for ratying it without delay. I know that I can count on your support and that of our fellow leaders to move the deal forward. The second letter is below.  Aha! Not quite. Mr Johnson carefully avoided sayinghe would or wouldnapost send the legal letter asking for a delay. But he did say: I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so! What Boris Johnson was doing here was saying that, evenforced to ask for a delay, he will make things as dficult and annoying as possible for the EU.  Technically, yes. Or turn down the three-month suggested period to suggest a dferent one instead. French President Emmanuel Macron went furthest. I am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay,” he said last week. But very few people seriously expect the EU to say noa request comes in. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those who has indicated as much. The big question is how long an extension would be. Would they grant just two weeks to allow the withdrawal bill legislation to pass through Parliament  Or would they insist on a longer one - until the end of January as set out in the Benn Act perhaps - to give the UK time to resolve this once and for all. Could it end up in court   Campaigners did try to get a court to stop Boris Johnson sending a second letter. But they could now try again, now that heaposs done it. Askedit could be challenged in court, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: It may well be. Others will decide that matter. But a number of lawyers have already commented that this is seeking to undermine a decision of Parliament and therefore flies in the face of both Parliament and court decisions.” Mr McDonnell accused the Prime Minister of behaving a bit like a spoilt brat over Brexit. Speaking on Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge on Sunday he said: He may well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts themselves because heaposs clearly trying to undermine the first letter and not signing the letter. Heaposs behaving a bit like a spoilt brat. Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first, I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided. Is Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal dead now   No, not at all. In fact, itaposs not actually affected by Saturdayaposs vote. Despite Boris Johnsonaposs intentions, the Commons showdown ended up being not very much to do with the deal at all. What will happen next   The government now plans to have another go at the aposmeaningful voteapos on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Itaposs not guaranteed - Speaker John Bercow will make a ruling on Monday on whether bringing the same vote again is within Commons rules. After that, ministers will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the parallel process that encodes the Brexit deal into law. MPs are expected to have their first big vote on the Bill, known as a second reading, on Tuesday. It would be rushed through Commons stages, potentially by Thursday, before being rushed over to the House of Lords. The idea is that, evenlegally Boris Johnson has to ask for a delay, Brexit will be voted through and done and dusted by October  anyway. Will the Brexit deal pass   It can. Though that doesnapost mean it will - the voteaposs on a kne edge. The PMaposs DUP allies vowed to vote against, while Labour oppose the deal for watering down workersapos rights. So victory hinges on just a few Tories and Labour MPs in Leave seats.  The same as they were before Saturdayaposs drama. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on October  - keeping a transition period to December  and the £bn orce bill, but scrapping the Irish backstop. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system. Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workersapos rights were deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later. On Friday night Boris Johnson unveiled a last-minute offer on workers’ rights after his deal watered them down. But it was slammed by Labour’s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it’s written on. I still donapost understand the Letwin amendment. Can you explain more   This is a bit tricky to explain. But basically, itaposs because Saturday was never going to be the final vote on the Brexit deal. MPs will get loads more votes on something called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which is an instrument used to pass the deal formally into law. The problem is thatthe Bill got stuck or disputed, the aposBenn Actapos - which forces the PM to seek a delay to Brexitthereaposs no deal - would have lapsed because it has an October  deadline. Sir Oliver feared that,the Withdrawal Agreement Bill somehow got snarled up after October , we would have been left in legal limbo on October . So his amendment refused to approve the Brexit deal unless and until every single vote on the legislation is safely passed. This meant Boris Johnson missed the pm deadline on October  to have a confirmed Brexit deal, so legally, he had to ask for a delay. What does all this mean for a second referendum   There is likely to be an attempt to tag a second referendum onto the Brexit legislation in the coming week. Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson are expected to bring back their amendment, which could get the backing of the Labour frontbench. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “That will almost inevitably come up. There was an amendment tabled on Saturday. We’ve always said, let the people decide.” But it is far from clear whether the numbers are there in Parliament for a fresh public vote - so they may hold off yet again. The Government has also indicated they would try to thwart any second referendum, possibly by refusing to sign off the cash. However the EU has said it would willingly grant a longer Brexit extension to hold one, or a general election.  If MPs spend the next two weeks legislating on Brexit , a general election cannot be held before Christmas. Labour is unlikely to trigger a confidence vote, which could collapse Boris Johnsonaposs administration, while the legislative process is ongoing. And because of the five-weeks legally needed between the calling of a snap ballot and a poll being held, taking up parliamentary time until Halloween mean the earliest ballot would be held is in January. That is because Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has reportedly warned an election should not take place after December  in the run-up to Christmas. But early January will not see an election either because no-one wants the festive season to be overshadowed by electoral campaigning. So the next likely date would be mid-February. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic.

Michael Gove made the bullish claim despite Boris Johnson being forced to request a three-month delay from EU leaders just hours earlier.The Prime Minister last night sent a a legally-required request to the EU to delay until January , deal or no deal, after he lost a vote in Parliament.But he refused to sign it and sent a second signed note which branded an extension corrosive. Meanwhile the PM is now racing to hold a fresh vote on his Brexit deal and get a Bill through the Commons to pass it into law in time for Halloween .If the Bill does not get through, and European leaders cave to Mr Johnsonaposs second letter by refusing to delay Brexit, Britain still risks no-deal next Thursday. Today Mr Gove - who leads no-deal planning - announced no-deal backup plan Operation Yellowhammer is being triggered.    And he led a Sunday meeting of the weekday no-deal planning aposXOapos committee in Whitehall. The truth is Operation Yellowhammer is not simply apostriggeredapos in one go - it is a multi-layered plan that has several elements. Whitehall sources insisted today that there was some substance behind Michael Goveaposs statement, but they couldnapost specy what that actually was. Mr Gove told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: We are going to leave by October . We have the means and the ability to do so. He added: The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension.    And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated. It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that,no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal. Boris Johnson still faces a kne-edge vote, with only a few MPs in play one way or the other, on whether to approve the Brexit deal he won with Brussels.Labour and the DUP rejected the deal for creating a customs border down the Irish Sea and watering down pledges on workersapos rights.But a handful of Labour backbenchers were won over after the PM made a non-legally-binding promise to improve workersapos rights later down the line.    And hard Brexiteer Tory aposSpartansapos have mostly been won over with the promise the deal can get Brexit done. Ministers will try to hold a meaningful vote tomorrow on the Brexit deal to give a clear indication which way it will go. Then on Tuesday they will start debating the full-blown Withdrawal Agreement Bill that encodes it into law.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons.A lot of people say aposGet this done and move onapos. Former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who quit the Tory whip, said she would back Mr Johnsonaposs deal. And so did Oliver Letwin, the ousted Tory who led yesterdayaposs successful bid to delay the October  Brexit date. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workersapos rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

Shocked, I looked at the invigilators, wondering what they were talking about. But as I turned my page to read the next question I heard it again. ‘Boom.’ I spun around to look at my fellow students, who had their heads bowed over their papers, as the word was repeated over and over again, sometimes quietly, sometimes shouted loudly. Not one single student reacted and it dawned on me the voice was inside my head. I forced myself to concentrate on the rest of the exam and gradually the noise subsided. Afterwards, as my classmates chatted and hugged, I quickly said my goodbyes and jumped into my mum’s car, terried and close to tears, but I didn’t say anything to my mum. That night as I lay in bed the voice started again, making random sounds or shouting one-syllable words. As I squeezed my eyes closed, desperately trying to get rid of the noise, an older man’s voice would shout ‘good’, ‘boom’ or even ‘rain’ and ‘snow’. Exam stress meant I hadn’t been sleeping, so I put it down to that, coupled with the depression and anxiety I’d been diagnosed with a year earlier. But every night, as I tried to sleep, the noises ed.    Then two weeks later a second voice, this time female, joined in and they took turns to say random one-syllable words. I’d lie awake, trying to ignore them, but my heart would be pumping. Every day I felt strung out and I quickly spiralled into a deep depression. Two weeks later, as my mum Gillian and I sat in the car together, I broke down. ‘I’m hearing voices in my head,’ I blurted out through my tears. She arranged for me to have an emergency mental health assessment. Three doctors assessed me and came to the conclusion the voices were a consequence of depression and anxiety, so I was prescribed anti-depressants. One doctor told me it’s common for healthy adults to hear voices in times of stress, which was reassuring. Taking the medication helped my anxiety and depression, but still the voices would come back, usually at night. By then they were saying full sentences and chatting together. Other times they’d make basic statements like ‘I really like apples’. And within months a third voice joined in, this time a male around the same age as me.    I soon noticed they had three distinct personalities, and even heard their names. The older man was called Eros and was definitely the ringleader. His was the voice I’d hear most often, and he loved to talk about himself in an egotistical way. Terry was the younger man, who tended to chat about college and high school, while Psyche, the female, was the kindest and often asked me about my day. That said, they could all be malicious, and when I was anxious they’d enjoy playing on my fears. If I was on my way to university in Liverpool, where I was studying Creative Writing, they’d insist the train was going to be late, orI was just stressed they’d agree something bad was about to happen. The lower I felt, the more they’d tell me I was fat and ugly, and over time my self-esteem plummeted. I knew the voices were a manestation of my own brain, but hearing over and over again how worthless I was Ieft me believing it. I went back and forwards to doctors, but they were convinced it was due to depression and anxiety, and I felt reluctant to push for anything more. I know hearing voices can be symptoms of psychosis or schizophrenia, but sometimes it can be nothing to do with mental illness at all. By the Christmas of my second year at university, it had all got too much to bear. I was still living at home, but I’d withdrawn from my family. Eventually I felt the only way out was to kill myself. On  December I tried to write a suicide note but I couldn’t concentrate, so to distract myself I scrolled through music videos on YouTube.I found myself enjoying Korean pop music and discovered that whenI was listening to it the voices stopped, possibly because I was concentrating on another language.Relieved, I listened to it all night, and the following day I confided in my mum about how low I’d got. She was incredibly supportive and together we worked out strategies to cope with my anxiety. When I went back to university after the New Year I decided to try a new approach and befriend the voices. It seemed to work, and now they are less malevolent and sometimes include me.Other times I can hear them chatting about politics or Brexitinformation I’ve absorbed through the day.However when I need some peace, drowning them out with Korean pop seems to work. I also findI ignore them they will eventually quieten down. Now they tend to only start up at night, unless I’m stressed in which case they can materialise at any time and make me jump because I wasn’t expecting them. They still are evil occasionally, but most of the time we rub along pretty well together. Telling my friends was terrying, as I thought it would change how they felt about me, but they’ve all reacted brilliantly. It hasn’t had a negative impact on any friendships – and I hope in the future the voices won’t stand in the way of me having a relationship either. At university, as part of my degree, we had to produce the first chapter of a science fiction novel, and I decided to incorporate my own experiences into my story.  I started a tale called Nightmare Scenario set in , where everyone has to wear a watch that tracks their every move. The main character has voices in her head that force her to play a dangerous game by threatening to hurt her or othersshe refuses. I found writing it cathartic, and feltpeople were prepared to believe in this dystopian world they might also be more accepting and understanding of those who hear voices in their head. Once I began to write, the words poured out of me, and within a month I’d finished my first draft. I was stunned and thrilled when a publisher agreed to produce my novel and now I can’t wait until it hits the shelves this month. It’s hard to talk about hearing voices because of the stigma, but it’s important to be open about mental health. Illnesses like psychosis and schizophrenia only make the news when the voices inside someone’s head have urged them to hurt someone or harm themselves. Mine have never done either of those things, and I think it’s important people know there’s another side to the condition. Of course I hope one day Eros, Terry and Psyche will fade away, but for now I’m managing to live alongside them, and I know they don’t define who I am or what I can achieve. I’m studying for a PhD and I hope to write more books in the Scenario series. I’ve learnt to accept there’s much more to me than just the voices in my head.

A little girl with a gentle smile, she embraced everything that came her way. She loved gymnastics, tennis, running and especially animals. Lisa and Gabe split in , when Teagan was just two years old, and orced two years later. Lisa, , had struggled to cope with the break-up and adjusting to her new le as a single mum. When she and Gabe tried to sort out the custody arrangements, tensions always ran high. Lisa was granted custody of Teagan, but Gabe wanted to be involved in his daughter’s le as much as possible. To help improve their communication with each other, they enlisted the help of a family counsellor and started to make official plans about childcare via email. Lisa remained in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, while Gabe moved to Ottawa, where he went on to marry his new partner, Stephanie.    She already had a five-year-old son, but loved Teagan like her own, and Teagan adored her step-brother. She’d go to stay with Gabe and Stephanie as often as she could, and Gabe would come to see her whenever he had the chance. Then in  the couple had a son together. For Lisa, however, le was less joyful. Her struggle with depression and anxiety spilled over, and in  she attempted to take her own le. Teagan went to stay with her dad, but once Lisa had recovered and was deemed safe to look after her daughter again, she was ed to her. Worried about Lisa’s state of mind, Gabe tried to get custody of Teagan, but his request was declined. Meticulous planning By , it was clear that Lisa’s behaviour was becoming irrational. She’d send Gabe endless texts and emails, and would call constantly through the week. It got to the point where there were so many messages, he’d have to respond to them in bulk, once a week. Some of them claimed there was an emergency, but when he’d call to checkLisa was OK, they’d argue and one of them would hang up. Nonetheless, they had a child together, so Gabe tried to work through it and put Teagan first. Although Lisa had the power to make it dficult for him, he remained civil. In early December , Lisa took Teagan on a day out to a zip-line centre and the eight-year-old was seen beaming in the photos that Lisa shared on social media.    The same week, Gabe paid his daughter a visit, dropping her off at school before he left for home. Later, Lisa messaged him with the words, ‘It seems you’d rather I disappeared.’ He didn’t know what she meant. This was just the latest in a long line of wild accusations. That night,  December, Lisa told Teagan they were going to have a ‘camp-out’ in their living room. It must have seemed such fun for the little girl, as they set up makesht beds. In the early hours of  December, Gabe received a message from Lisa saying Teagan was unwell with the flu and wouldn’t be going to school. Then at lunchtime that day, a  call was placed by a member of the public in Surrey, saying a woman had crashed her car in a residential cul-de-sac. It initially seemed to the police to be a regular traffic call-out, but soon after they arrived, they realised it was far more serious. The car was Lisa’s. She was found curled up in the boot. In her arms, she was cradling her daughter’s dead body. It was a horric and confusing scene. How could the child have been killed in such a minor accident   Officers realised something wasn’t right. Lisa kept repeating, ‘I just wanna die’, and that she wanted her daughter to ‘be with Jesus’. She was found with a large kitchen kne. Once Lisa had been taken in for questioning, investigators were able to piece together what had happened. Teagan hadn’t died in the crash – she’d been killed by her own mother. In a two-hour-long interview, Lisa was recorded blaming what she’d done on her struggle with mental health. And when it came to a motive, they could find only one: Lisa had killed Teagan to spite her ex-husband, to make sure Gabe didn’t get custody. Premeditated evil On the night of their ‘camp-out’ Teagan had been sleeping when Lisa fetched a plastic bag and held it over her daughter’s mouth and nose. It would have taken four to five minutes to ensure she was dead. Lisa claimed she then intended to take her own le. She left notes for people to find. One read, ‘You win, Gabe’. Another said, ‘You broke me’. She wrote that she couldn’t believe what she’d done and deserved to be punished. But she told police she failed to take her own le and decided she would drive off a clf or stab herself instead. So she placed Teagan’s body in the boot of her car, grabbed a kne and drove away. Then she ran her car into a ditch.  ‘I went and knocked on someone’s door and said, “Please call the police, my daughter’s dead in the car,”’ Lisa told officers. ‘And then I crawled in and snuggled with her until the last minute.’ When Gabe found out what his ex-we had done, he was distraught. It was unthinkable that he’d been holding her hand just the day before and was now faced with having to choose the clothes to bury her in. Despite Lisa’s claims of incapacity, she was deemed mentally fit for trial. In , she pleaded not guilty to the second-degree murder of her daughter. The prosecution maintained she’d killed Teagan to spite her husband, because she’d planned to take her le and didn’t want him to get custody afterwards. They pointed out that in one of the notes she’d left, she’d said, ‘I couldn’t imagine leaving here and leaving her to him’. Lisa could have called  at any point, but she didn’t. Her defence lawyers claimed she’d killed Teagan because her mental illness made her wrongly believe her daughter was in danger from her father. But in March this year, she was found guilty, and this September faced sentencing.  The second-degree murder conviction automatically meant she’d get le, but there were arguments about how long her parole period should be. Lisa’s lawyers said she’d been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder while awaiting trial, and that at the time of the murder she’d been suffering from anxiety. But Justice Catherine Murray said Lisa had breached Teagan’s trust in the worst possible way and lied about the extent of her mental illness to justy what she’d done. She called the decision to murder ‘deliberate, systematic, focused, purposeful and goal-oriented’. Lisa sobbed as she read a statement to the court apologising for what she’d done. ‘I’d give anything to go back and change what happened. aposEach morning, I wake up to this excruciating nightmare and I don’t know how this can be real. aposI miss my sweet girl so much,’ she said. ‘I cannot believe I did what I did – but I know her death is my fault.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"always remove feminine symbols sanitary","story":"NewsAlways to remove feminine symbols from sanitary products to be more inclusiveA sanitary towel brand has announced they will be removing feminine logos from their products from DecemberShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  OCT NewsAlways will remove feminine symbols from their packaging \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Sheryl wrote: Dear Ben, I wanted to come back to you regarding your message about the Always wrappersapos design with the female symbol on it you sent   . We listened to you and our marketing team worked a solution!    We are glad to inform you that as of December we will use a new wrapper design without the feminine symbol.

She added: We are absolutely grateful for having people like you voicing their opinions. Thank you for contacting us, your comments help us improve every day! The move was praised by a number of people, including Ben and Melly, for being inclusive. Another person on social media that supported the decision, said: I understand that you guys love girl positivity but please understand that there are trans men that get periods.

Following the announcement, a spokesperson for Proctor  Gamble said: For over  years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so. We’re also committed to ersity and inclusion, and after hearing from many people across genders and age groups, we realised that not everyone who has a period and needs to use a pad identies as female. To ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable in doing so with Always, we updated our pad wrapper design. Our mission remains to ensure no girl loses confidence at puberty because of her gender or period and we do this through our puberty education programs, by providing access to period products with programs such as #EndPeriodPoverty, and by using our brand voice to tackle societal barriers and stigmas like we did with #LikeAGirl.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton have both taken inspiration from Princess Diana, a body language expert has revealed. Judi James exclusively told MirrorOnline how both royals are incredibly adept when it comes to interacting with children during royal engagements. Both women use some very smart body language rituals to put both them and the youngsters they meet at ease during their royal visits. Apart from Meghan’s new role as a mother and Kate’s full immersion in the skills of being a mum to three, there are several clues to the secret of their success. Hereaposs what body language expert Judy James has to say: The Diana factor  Diana really did set the new template for natural, tactile behaviour on royal tours. She broke with royal tradition that tended to dictate a visiting royal would do little more than receive bouquets from the kids and smile while retaining a regal, dignied posture and facial expression. The memory created in the people they met was more one of having seen a very special, high-status person. Diana’s techniques of self-lowering, such as diminishing her own status, signals to make people feel at ease allowed both Kate and Meghan to reach out to children at their own level instead. Mirroring techniques    Both Kate and Meghan employ some very clever mirroring techniques with the children they meet to allow for a more natural and less over-awed response. Meghan’s tour even involved some mirroring with her clothing, opting for denims and casual wear rather than a more formal, regal look. Once she learns the steps of the dancing the girls are doing in these clips she mimics their steps with a lack of inhibition to allow them all to be enjoying the same experience at the same time. Kate dips down to the same level as the smaller children she is meeting and we can see her mimicking their ‘baby wave’ rituals, with a low, childlike wave ritual as she approaches and leaves them. Status-swapping    Kate and Meghan both lower their own status and power signals to raise the confidence levels of the children they meet. Meghan approaches the dancers with a head-tilt and slightly shy smile, carefully watching and eye-checking the dancers before picking up their steps. She allows them to teach her and in both these clips she is taking her learning seriously, putting the power in the hands of the children. Kate is seen playing with some children at a table and again she is watching them and appearing to learn from then rather than the other way round. When she approaches the group of children that are standing to meet her she immediately uses self-diminishing techniques to lower her own status with them, pulling her arms into her body and lowering to their height. All this body language self-lowering would have the effect of boosting the young childrens’ confidence.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum claims she could feel aposeverythingapos as her epidural wore off midway through her caesarean section. Jodie Marsden, , has told how she was in utter agony, saying she was able to feel the clamp, suction, jiggling and aposshovingapos inside her. She says she was in so much pain she could barely whisper. The mum says she had no idea of the nightmare that lay ahead when she arrived at hospital to be induced - but it left her vowing to never get pregnant again. After two days of very slow labour, Jodieaposs unborn babyaposs heart started to dip with every contraction and doctors rushed her into theatre for an emergency c-section. They gave her an epidural - an anaesthetic around the spinal cord - and while it worked at first, Jodie said she began to feel pain.    Thankfully baby Arthur was healthy but the whole experience - which happened on Friday th - has put Jodie off having any more kids. Jodie from Wakefield said: I could feel them juggling about inside my stomach - one person was shoving down on the top of my stomach whilst another was pulling the baby out. It was agony. I could feel the clamp inside me and the suction going around and I was really struggling to breathe. The whole experience was absolutely terrying and I am totally traumatised from the birth. We said ourselves that he would wait until Friday the th to make an appearance, and then we noticed it was a full moon, but it never crossed our mind what would happen. I could feel them actually pulling my stomach apart as they were ripping the muscles and I was in extreme pain. It felt like I was screaming in pain, but my partner said it was only coming out as a whisper, but luckily they could see I was uncomfortable. Iaposm never having another baby ever again, thataposs for sure.    Dog groomer Jodie was in no rush to start a family after tying the knot with husband Matt, , in September . She fell pregnant unexpectedly weeks later, but sadly miscarried at just seven weeks. The miscarriage changed Jodieaposs thoughts on motherhood, and after celebrating their first Christmas as a married couple, the pair found out Jodie was pregnant again. Jodie said: We didnapost actually plan on having children so soon after the wedding, as Iaposm a very career driven person and wanted to focus on my dog grooming business. Iaposve never really been a maternal person, it was never something I had in a plan and I could never see myself with children, but the miscarriage changed my way of thinking. After the miscarriage, I was convinced that there was something wrong with me. We had no plans to try again, we just went with the flow and saidit happens, then it happens, andit doesnapost, then it wasnapost supposed to be. I found out I was pregnant again just after Christmas, and although I was happy, it was a tough set of emotions to deal with as I was convinced it was all going to happen again.  She developed pregnancy hypertension in the last six weeks of her pregnancy so was induced on her due date,  September , at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield. Doctors administered an epidural, but two days later, she had only dilated cm and was given a hormone drip as well to encourage her baby to arrive. As the contractions started, doctors grew concerned when Jodieaposs unborn childaposs blood pressure dropped dangerously and prepped the young mum for an emergency c-section. Once in theatre, doctors upped the dose of Jodieaposs epidural, but despite checks to ensure she was numb, she says all hell broke loose when she could suddenly feel everything. Jodie said: They did multiple checks to make sure I was numb, with an ice cold spray on several areas of my stomach, followed by jabbing me with a needle, and all was fine, I was numb. For the incision, I just felt slight pressure, but then I felt them actually pulling my stomach apart as they were ripping the muscles and I was in so much pain. The anaesthetist was asking meit was pain or pressure, and I was saying pain, but Matt said it was just like a whisper coming out of me. They could see I was uncomfortable, so they gave me more medication to try and get the pain under control but I was still in pain.  Jodie says her pain relief from the epidural had stopped working in the middle of her c-section, and the first time mum was able to feel the entire procedure. Her blood pressure rose dangerously and after her baby Arthur was born, doctors were forced to put her under general anaesthetic, fearing she might suffer a stroke or heart attack, she told. The young mum lost . pints of blood and stayed in theatre for another hour and a half before being monitored in recovery for  hours. Jodie said: When they finally pulled Arthur out, all I remember was hearing this little scream which suddenly stopped. I canapost remember seeing him, and I turned to Matt and repeatedly asked him aposWhere is my baby apos Then it was like an out of body experience, I could hear things but it was like I was just watching from above. I could hear them saying they needed to get the bleeding under control, and then the anaesthetist said aposWeaposre going to have to send you to sleepapos. They escorted Matt out and then took Arthur to see him and my mum, but I had to stay in theatre for another hour and a half without holding my baby. Before the c-section, the anaesthetist told me that general anaesthetic is literally the last resort because itaposs best for mums to have skin to skin contact straight away, but nothing was working for me so they had to do it.  Jodie finally got to hold her baby boy Arthur the next day, and thankfully the young mum is now doing well and is back home with her family. Traumatised by the experience, Jodie has decided not to have any more children and is focusing on raising her only son. Jodie said: It definitely wasnapost what we expected - itaposs not like you see on One Born Every Minute where theyaposre laid all calm and comfortable. It was like living in a nightmare, and Iaposm definitely not having any more children. I love Arthur and am enjoying being a mum, but thereaposs no way Iaposm going through that all ever again.

The woman, who did not wish to be named, and her children have lived at Kingfisher Caravan Park in Ingoldmells, Lincolnshire, for several years. But a new policy at the coastal holiday park means any caravans that are more than  years old automatically have to leave the site.

Other people with holiday homes at Kingfisher have also complained they will have to be off-site soon because of the age of their caravan. A letter obtained by Lincolnshire Live addressed to caravan owners at the park alludes to the changes made as part of a review recently carried out. The changes aim to bring the site in line with how most other caravan parks operate along the coast, it said. As your caravan is more than  years past its manufacture date, the change in policy means it would have to undergo and pass an inspection to qualy for an extension of license agreement for a further one year to stay on Kingfisher Caravan Park. This practice will continue until your caravan passes its -year point of manufacture date.

It was a diplomatic triumph and they both looked fabulous in those colourful ­traditional costumes. And, at every turn, scores of clicking, flashing cameras captured glorious images of the beaming couple. But Kate really knocked it out of the park, playing cricket and meeting kids in a cancer hospital. Because she was treading in Princess Diana’s footsteps at ­places she visited in the s, and she knew wearing a similar ­shalwar kameez would spark “Di’s Double” headlines.

So, when the royal plane was stuck in a nasty thunderstorm over Lahore, William went down the aisle to check they were OK and have a laugh. What a contrast to his brother Harry, whose obsessive hatred for the press is truly concerning. He and Meghan did a brilliant job on their African tour and highlighted Diana’s unfinished landmine campaign. I’d even forgotten about that eco-warrior private jet hypocrisy. But then Harry accused the press of hounding Meghan, suggesting we will drive her to her death as he wrongly thinks we did Diana.

The sold-out Blood Brothers musical at Derby Theatre was abruptly halted when Connor Bannister, who played the part of Mickey, darted off the stage resulting in the production being paused.DerbyshireLive reported that the theatre was in a quandary as Connor was an understudy standing in for Alexander Patmore who had suffered a back inury.But  minutes later a staff member came on stage and told the audience: “I do apologise. Connor, who has been on as Mickey this afternoon, has been taken very ill all of a sudden.    “But, we would love to give you the rest of the show. The only option for us to do that is to send one of our actors on with a script to read Mickey’s lines.” “If you are happy for us to do that, we will do that.” There was huge applause and the performance resumed minutes later, with McCourt doing an incredible job. At the end of the performance, there was a huge standing ovation for McCourt and he was hugged and congratulated by fellow cast members. Audience member Nicola Carruthers, , praised his performance.

Temperatures will hit C in the next few days as many parts of the country enjoy clear and sunny spells. It will mark a stark contrast to the first half of the month where miserable weather has led to flood warnings over successive days. The Met Office forecasts Sunday to be a largely sunny day with maximums of C and the chance of a few showers in the far southwest. The drier conditions will then continue into Monday where outbreaks of rain in the east will again give way to spells of fine weather and C highs. Tuesday again will remain sunny  in the south with only the odd shower, while the north will experience more cloudy and windy weather.  Meanwhile, temperatures will fall at night with frosts expected in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. A Met Office spokesperson told Sun Online: It could be a rather unsettled week, although not as wet as last week. From Monday, most areas will be dry apart from patches of rain in the south east.  It will be the same on Tuesday and wednesday, but rain will move across to the North West. According to some longer term forecasts, the UK is set for a wet and stormy end to the year. AccuWeather meteorologist Tyler Roys said: Many cities will receive above-normal rainfall this winter, including Cardf, London, Bristol, Manchester, Glasgow and Belfast, but we are not calling for record-breaking rainfall.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da98c1ca3e9a5.80841723.jpg ","title":"gap talk irks winger declan mcdaid as dee seek wins","story":"Dundee attacker Declan McDaid insists any talk of the league being over after their derby defeat has only served to spur them on.The Dark Blues lost - to city rivals Dundee United at the end of August to open up a gap of seven points at the top of the Championship.Some had written off the Dee that night and made the Terrors favourites for the title.However, ahead of tomorrow’s meeting with Partick Thistle at Dens Park, McDaid has sullied such talk and insists they are only focused on winning back-to-back for the first time in the league this season and pushing up the table.“It was never over,” the former Partick and Ayr United man said.“People keep saying that ‘gap’, what was it seven points  We were four games in!“This league is never over that early and we weren’t even thinking about anything to do with that.“We were just trying to get our results right, which we have been.“We just need to keep that up and see what happens.

Dundee is on the up and that’s one of the reasons we invested initially. When I first arrived the Waterfront was all rubble, it was hard to see it was a city on the up. But now the Waterfront is fantastic.“The focus can’t just be there, it has to be in the city centre and surrounding areas.“We need to build Dundee into a place where people want to spend more than a couple of hours.”More than  jobs could be created by a new stadium at Camperdown Park.Dundee managing director John Nelms has revealed government predictions suggest Dundonians could benefit from hundreds of jobs thanks to the project.He said: “All of these things, the hotel, the restaurants, the crematorium all bring jobs. “according to government documents, it brings about  full time jobs.#It also brings, over a two-three year period, construction jobs and part-time jobs.#It creates more opportunity for the city and that’s our goal.”Nelms also hopes a new stadium can help bring top music acts to Dundee and help Slessor Gardens to carry the load – as well as a conference centre which can attract , guests. He added:“We can have concerts for up to , at slessor Gardens but we’d like to have concerts which host , people.

with Hibs at Pittodrie a fortnight ago.Lewis Ferguson and Curtis Main dropped out due to suspension, Dean Campbell and Ryan Hedges were moved to the bench and Ethan Ross dropped out of the -man squad altogether.In came Mikey Devlin, McGinn, Jon Gallagher, James Wilson and Vyner.With six defenders on the pitch there was intrigue as to how the Reds would line-up pre-match.The answer was a --- formation with Vyner and Greg Leigh used as holding midfielders.The match roared into le with both sides looking to get on the front foot in the early stages and in the fth minute Motherwell passed up a great chance to take the lead.Shay Logan was short with a pass back to keeper Lewis, Chris Long nipped in first and was tripped by Lewis, with referee Euan Anderson quickly pointing to the penalty spot.Scott stepped up, but his right footed effort was tipped over the bar by Lewis, who flung himself to his right.After quarter of an hour Aberdeen took the lead with a devastating counter-attack.The Steelmen#s skipper Peter Hartley was off the pitch receiving treatment for an injury with Barry Maguire dropping into central defence and marking Cosgrove.Long had possession for the home side, but Leigh tackled him in the centre of the pitch and the alert Cosgrove spun away from Maguire. Leigh found him with the perfect through ball and the striker raised into the box and chipped the beyond Mark Gillespie for his th goal of the season.Soon after Jon Gallagher headed over from a Logan cross, but midway through the first period Motherwell hit the woodwork.Declan Gallagher#s measured ball found the lively Long on the right side of the area, he side-stepped Lewis, but with the angle against him Long#s attempted finish hit the right post and went behind.Up until the interval the same pattern continued with Motherwell having more of the ball, but struggling to penetrate the Dons defence, while the men from the Granite City appeared threatening when they were able to counter-attack at speed.Eight minutes into the second half the Reds left the Steelmen with a mountain to climb as they moved two up.Aberdeen pressed Motherwell and when Allan Campbell dithered  yards from goal McGinn pounced. The Northern Irish international won the ball and curled a shot into the top right corner from the edge of the area.Any hopes of a home comeback were extinguished on the hour when Vyner created space  yards out and hammered a right footed shot in off the right post.By now Motherwell were ragged at the back and Leigh#s cross-cum-shot slipped just wide.Andy Considine also sent a header by the far post in the closing stages, but it finished -.Motherwell: Mark Gillespie, Richard Tait, Liam Grimshaw, Peter Hartley , Allan Campbell, Christopher Long, Sherwin Seedorf, Barry Maguire , James Scott , Liam Polworth, Declan Gallagher.Subs not used: Trevor Carson, Christy Manzinga, Christian Ilic, Jamie Semple.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan, Andy Considine, Mikey Devlin, Scott McKenna, Greg Leigh , Jon Gallagher, Zak Vyner, James Wilson , Niall McGinn , Sam Cosgrove.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Craig Bryson, Ryan Hedges, Bruce Anderson."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/PA-47072957-125x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"abba afternoon tea","story":"An ABBA tribute band is set to perform in Aberdeen next month to raise money for Parkinson’s UK.Tickets are still available for the afternoon tea event which will be held at the Marclfe Hotel on November .Pam McRae from Inverness, who lives with Parkinson’s, has already signed up for the event where tribute band Abba A Rival will be playing.She said: “Helping to raise awareness of the condition and at the same time raising much-needed funds to help find a cure is the goal, and what better way to do it than enjoying a delicious afternoon tea, including a glass of bubbles, with a group of good friends.”Tickets cost £ per person and are available at www.parkinsons.org.uk events ladies- afternoon-tea-aberdeen."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/EE-KF-141019-01-02-450x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet lexi lola and harley are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home. vw, px\"  This sweet girl is nine years old.She’s a friendly pup, but being a little older she doesn’t want to live with young children or other dogs or cats.Lexi loves playing with her toys, especially footballs!

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic final minute sees young pupils take points","story":"With a dramatic finish to the game the Pupils Youth Under s ed to Kintyre with all three points after a tight encounter played at Glasgow Club Milton on Sunday.This was the first time the sides had met and the Pupils knew they would be in for another tough test on the road playing against a side which won the GADYFL B Division last season.The visitors showed no signs of their early journey to the north end of Glasgow as they started brightly and enjoyed the majority of possession early in the game. However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope.

Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach. And at night, of course, for he was still unused to sleeping alone after  years of sharing the night with the woman he loved. It didnrsquot seem right, men were supposed to be outlived by women, not left behind like this.Suddenly, his attention was caught by the sight of his grandson wading into the sea, still wearing his shoes and socks.ldquoNo lad, yoursquoll...Too late, he was jumping in the waves, splashing and laughing. His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy. The boyrsquos shoes were now completely soaked, as were the lower part of his trousers. The old man knew he would be in trouble with his daughter for allowing this to happen. Common sense told him to get annoyed and tell his grandson to come out immediately andto the car.ldquoI donrsquot think your mum will ever trust me again to look after you, he said.Another wave rolled in and the young lad screamed with delight and jumped over it.ldquoCome on granddad!The old man reckoned that the boyrsquos shoes were already soaked and a few more minutes in the sea wouldnrsquot make things any worse. He couldnrsquot bend down properly to take his own shoes off, but he waded into the sea anyway. He kept himself steady with his walking stick in one hand, and took the hand of his grandson with the other.They stood together and watched as a wave rolled in. The boy yelled with delight as he jumped over it, holding fast onto his granddadrsquos hand, who made his walking stick jump over it.ldquoAgain granddad, again, the young lad called out, laughing. Wave after wave came in and they faced them together.ldquoWe need to go now and get dry and warm up, said his granddad after a while.ldquoJust one more, please!And so they had one more wave jump together and headed for the car, both equally soaked. When they arrived at the car, their shoes and trouser bottoms were coated in sand, like breaded haddock.The boyrsquos mother was waiting in the car.She looked at their shoes and trousers. ldquoDad, what on earth have you been doing  His shoes are soaking and so are yours! I donrsquot believe it, what were you thinking  And now my car will be full of sand.ldquoI was thinking of your mum, he said. ldquoShe loved the beach and jumping the waves when we were young, and so did you when you were wee.ldquoYes, but not with our shoes on! said his daughter angrily, peeling off a sock from her son and pointing to his sodden shoes.ldquoLook at your shoes, dad, yoursquore not a child, you should know better.ldquoIt was so fun, mum, said her son, asto explain the state they were in.When they got back to the house, the granddad went to a cupboard and took out a box. He rummaged in it for while.ldquoAh, here it is, he said, holding an old photo album.He gave it to his daughter.She looked at it and smiled.ldquoCan I see  asked her son.So they all sat together with the photo.ldquoWell, thatrsquos your granny and that wee girl whose hand she is holding is your mum, said the granddad.ldquoThatrsquos my mum ldquoYes, and her mum, your granny, was loads of fun. They are jumping the waves together.ldquoLike us.ldquoYes, except your mum fell over and got her clothes wet.The old manrsquos daughter smiled. ldquoI remember that day so well, she said, ldquoit was so funny, didnrsquot mum fall and get her clothes wet as well ldquoShe did, said her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry about the shoes, he said, ldquobut I wanted the memory of today to be of fun, not of being told off because of the state of the clothes. Your mum always used to say lsquomuddy clothes means a happy childrsquo.They put the shoes on the radiator and the granddad stayed for the bedtime story.ldquoWhat story would you like  he asked his sleepy grandson.ldquoCan you tell me the story of my granny at the beach with mum again And so the granddad told the story of his grandsonrsquos granny at the beach. And the simple story gave him a memory of his granny he couldnrsquot remember, but who he now knew."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-nearly-200-homes-windygoul-south-tranent","story":"The ambitious

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt-bookshop-hails-community-behind-milestone","story":"Category Is Books was Scotlandrsquos first LGBT+ bookshop in  years and, since opening in Govanhill in September , has become a nirvana for the community.Charlotte said: ldquoWe really couldnrsquot quite anticipate just how many people were going to come out and support us.ldquoWe were shocked and ecstatic and overwhelmed at how many people came out to support us.

The future direction of the UK, and with it the unavoidable consequences for our most disadvantaged communities, lie in their hands.Mr Johnson, at the behest of his puppet-master, Dominic Cummings, insisted on describing the Benn Act, which required him to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date in the event of no deal, as the Surrender Act. The PM, though, has now produced the Surrender Deal, in which he has meekly relinquished the red lines of Theresa May, cheerfully defenestrated the Ulster Unionists, and coughed up a substantial orce settlement he once famously pledged never to contemplate.At any other time the SNP could put its feet up and enjoy the spectacle of Britainrsquos political establishment committing Seppuku. All that it would be required to do was nimbly avoid the ambuscades and dutully vote to reject the Johnson deal as being bad for the UK and Scotland. What should it matter to it whether Britain remains within the EU  It is pledged to leave the UK and the conduct of Britainrsquos most implacable Brexiters has helped its cause immeasurably. Independence having been secured, it could thereafter consult with the Scottish people about our future trading relationship with the EU. The SNP, though, seems intent on wasting the opportunities granted to its over the last three years and committing its own act of self-immolation.Its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned rebels within her own party of walking into a Unionist bear-trap. Perhaps she ought instead to be assessing the potential damage from the recent own goals contrived by her own party. The most lamentable of these has been the high-handed refusal by the party executive to entertain any semblance of a debate about an independence Plan B. This is exacerbated by its failure to produce a coherent tactical strategy for exploiting the Brexit convulsions of the British political establishment. It has also permitted a poisonous fringe of trans-gender activists to enter its bloodstream.The SNP womenrsquos group which emerged last week was formed partly as a response to the threats and intimidation many of them have recently encountered by trans-gender activists. Two of their guiding lights are Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry MP, committed feminists both and two of the brightest talents in the party. Simply for questioning the SNPrsquos official position on self-ID in the gender debate, they have been abused and bullied amidst moves to have them de-selected by a tiny but curiously influential group attached to the partyrsquos scarecrow youth wing.Entryism in the political sphere isnrsquot merely about pursuing a narrow agenda. It occurs when an unrepresentative group of people, in the face of overwhelming public rejection of their views, are happy to damage an entire cause and its chances of success in pursuit of these. In seeking to destroy the careers of some of the SNPrsquos brightest and best theyre doing much more damage to the prospects of independence than any Tory. They are enemies of the Yes movement.On Brexit, according to a rigorously scientic and wide-ranging Panelbase Poll conducted by the influential Yes website, Wings Over Scotland, a clear majority of the SNPrsquos own supporters oppose the partyrsquos Brexit strategy of outright opposition. This merely confirmed the wrinkles and nuances which the EU referendum produced among SNP voters in . The party needed to be adroit here, paying heed to the emerging view that Brexit will make independence more likely while not alienating the majority view among its own supporters who favour soft-Brexit above stopping it completely. Instead, the Holyrood leadership, where all power in the party resides, has performed a series of contortions to support a Peoplersquos Vote while also desperately seeking an early General Election for no other reason, it seems, than to avoid any collateral damage from the forthcoming trial of its former leader, Alex Salmond. The decision to crush all dissent over an independence Plan B is the culmination of three years of missed opportunities in the course of Brexit.The SNP commands all that it surveys in Scotland, an anointed position it continues to enjoy mainly because of the abject failures of leadership in the Labour Party in Scotland. Since , though, the main theatres of politics have been in Westminster and Brussels, places are populated by political royalty who can claim lineage to the English civil war and the origins of the Hapsburg Empire. They have been moving the pieces on Europersquos chessboard for centuries. To gain any idends for your cause you need to move among them and learn their ways. Mr Salmond was at home in this environment, making alliances and using Scotlandrsquos soft power ndash its scenery and natural produce ndash to make alliances and friends across nations and political boundaries.Itrsquos inconceivable that he would have allowed the Brexit chaos to pass without exploiting it in the cause of Scotlandrsquos independence. In this he would surely have deployed the considerable leverage of the SNPrsquos Westminster contingent to secure movement on a Section  order long before now. In these last three years though, the SNP has effectively split into two separate entities who barely acknowledge each other: Holyrood and Westminster. The Holyrood leadership are strangers to the men and women who control Europe and the UK, these shadowy puppet-masters who make things happen. Instead, shady chancers within the SNP ndash and known to the leadership ndash have been given licence to target Joanna Cherry, a politician who is widely respected in these circles. Misogyny and deep envy are at the root of this.After all of this the SNP is now, yet again ldquodemanding that a Section  order be granted. Just like that. Yet again it will be refused. And not for the first time you begin to wonder how sincerely it wants it. Twelve years in devolved government, with the virtual guarantee of another seven, is making some personal pension plans dance and stimulating the second-homes market on Scotlandrsquos wee bit hill and glen. Perhaps the partyrsquos new slogan ought to be: ldquoIndependence, but not just yet with a winking emoji.Read more: Sturgeon: SNP MPs will not back Brexit deal"},{"url":null,"title":"global-superstar-dj-martin-garrix-provide-sound-uefa-euro-2020","story":"The -year-old revealed the news while performing a headline show in his hometown of Amsterdam, one of the  host cities for next summerrsquos finals.As his blinding set and dazzling lighting show thrilled the sold-out gig at Amsterdam RAI, he provided an unexpected encore by walking out with the famous Henri Delaunay Cup ndash the trophy that the winner of UEFA EURO  will receive ndash as the giant screens behind him confirmed he would be the Official Music Artist of next yearrsquos tournament.:Watch: All goals and extended highlights from Scotland - San Marino at HampdenThe song will be revealed in spring  ndash and so too a collaboration with a singer.

That is a  choice and by voting for Boris Johnsons deal, we would have opened the door to a decade of negotiations leading to deregulation and a trade deal with Donald Trump.ldquoThis deal was a sell out that would lead to a sell off. Labour is clear that we must let the people decide and that any Brexit deal must be put back to the public with the option to remain on the ballot paper.\"LibDem leader Jo Swinson said: ldquoThe fight to stop Brexit continues, and the Liberal Democrats will keep working for a Peoplersquos Vote so that the people can have the final say.ldquoHundreds of thousands of people are marching outside to demand a final say and a Peoplersquos Vote. The Prime Minister must now obey the law and send a letter asking for an extension to Article .ldquoThe Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain.

He was respected as a sculptor and architect, but no sculpture or buildings by him survive. He was a military and civil engineer who plotted with Machiavelli to ert the river Arno, but the scheme was never executed.Da Vinci was also an anatomist and dissected  human corpses.But his groundbreaking anatomical work was never published ndash and he planned treatises on painting, water, mechanics, the growth of plants and many other subjects, although none was ever finished.ldquoAs so much of his lersquos work was unrealised or destroyed, Leonardorsquos greatest achievements survive only in his drawings and manuscripts, say the Royal Collection Trust.ldquoThe drawings by Leonardo in the Royal Collection have been together as a group since the artistrsquos death in , and entered the Collection during the reign of Charles II, around .ldquoLeonardo firmly believed that visual evidence was more persuasive than academic argument, and that an image conveyed knowledge more accurately and concisely than any words.ldquoFew of his drawings were intended for others to see: drawing served as his laboratory, allowing him to work out his ideas on paper and search for the universal laws that he believed underpinned all of creation.ldquoIn the breadth of his interests, Leonardo was the archetypal lsquoRenaissance manrsquo, and his work is characterised by a multitude of artistic and scientic pursuits that cross-fertilised each other over many years.Da Vincirsquos research into the human body stemmed from a desire to be ldquotrue to nature in his painting, and in time anatomy became his greatest scientic pursuit.Though he never completed his planned treatise on the subject, da Vincirsquos later anatomical studies mark him out as one of the great scientists of the Renaissance.The exhibition includes some of the finest examples of the artistrsquos anatomical drawings, including The skull sectioned , The fetus in the womband The cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman .ldquoDrawings of horses abound throughout Leonardorsquos work, including studies for three equestrian monuments that were never realised, said the trust. ldquoThe sculpture that would have been his masterpiece, a monument to Francesco Sforza, the late Duke of Milan, fell victim to the turbulence of politics and warfare that was a constant shadow over Leonardorsquos career.ldquoStudies for the monument, which would have been the largest bronze cast in Western Europe since antiquity, include A design for an equestrian monumentand Studies of a horse .The natural world is explored by da Vinci through detailed landscapes, studies of water and in numerous botanical studies, the finest of which were developed in preparation for the now lost painting Leda and the Swan, including A branched bur-reed .The artistrsquos Leda was the only female nude that he ever painted, and the nakedness of her body was emphasised by her elaborate hairstyle of braids and coils, the focus of the preparatory study The head of Leda .Da Vinci gained a reputation as a skilled map-maker and engineer, and in August  he was appointed military architect and engineer to Cesare Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI and Marshal of the Papal Troops.Over the next few months, Leonardo surveyed Borgiarsquos strongholds to the north and east of Florence, and created his most impressive surviving map, A map of Imola .He continued to make maps on histo Florence, several of which were connected with his proposed projects in civil engineering, including a map of the Valdichianaand The Arno valley with the route of a proposed canal .His most famous work is the Mona Lisa, which hangs in the Louvre in Paris.Towards the end of his le, da Vinci left Italy forever and moved to France.His body was failing, and in his late drawings and writings he became obsessed by the subject of a cataclysmic storm overwhelming the Earth and sweeping away all matter.But far from being chaotic, these deluges were drawn and described with the dispassionate eye of a scientist.The most elaborate is A tempest , in which wind gods hurl thunderbolts among dense clouds, while a landslide peels away from the remains of a mountain and falls into the rushing waters below.The exhibition in Edinburgh is the culmination of a year-long nationwide event, which has given the widest-ever UK audience the opportunity to see the work of this unparalleled artist.In February,  of da Vincirsquos drawings from the Royal Collection went on display in  simultaneous exhibitions at museums and galleries across the UK, attracting more than one million visitors.Martin Clayton, head of prints and Drawings at the Royal Collection Trust, said: poundThe drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are both incredibly beautul and the main source of our knowledge of the artist.ldquoAs our year-long celebration of Leonardorsquos le draws to a close with the largest exhibition of his work ever shown in Scotland, we hope that as many people as possible will take this unique opportunity to see these extraordinary works, and

This is an occurrence reserved for the most fraught of circumstance and there is no question that a bid to ram through a devastating Brexit deal with little scrutiny merits such an occasion.Now I am a committed Remainer and I believe that there is no Brexit deal as good as the one currently we have, but there were a number of signicant faults with this deal in particular. First of all, while it might have reduced the risk of medicine shortages after October , it offers no guarantee of a deal in the long run. All it does is move the No Deal clf edge to the end of . All an unscrupulous PM and his hardline allies needs to do is fail to present a Free Trade Agreement to parliament next year, the transition lapses and then we have no deal.The second major reason is the threat that it poses to the integrity of the UK. Last year Ruth Davidson and David Mundell wrote to the Prime Minister that they ldquocould not support any deal that creates a border of any kind in the Irish Sea and undermines the Union, beyond what currently exists. They were right then and nothing has changed since.:People dont trust a word Johnson saysThe case against independence is still strong, but the deal that the Prime Minister proposes risks undermining it. We all know that the SNP will use any issue to build the grievance on which their case is built. This deal risks playing into their hands.Likewise, from their comments in the press and in Parliament, even the DUP were appalled by the way that Northern Ireland was being treated. It is safe to say that Arlene Foster can be added to the list of women who Boris Johnson has lied to and abandoned.Liberal Democrats will continue to oppose Brexit. We know that it would hammer the economy, cost jobs across the country and sell workers down the river.This makes it all the more astonishing that members of the Labour Party are shaping up to back it. These MPs risk throwing away their partyrsquos progressive heritage to vote for a far harder Brexit than the deal negotiated by Theresa May that Parliament rejected.

Government sources have made clear it will do everything possible, including sitting through the night and over weekends, to get the bill through by October . One senior Conservative MP boasted that the Government would ldquobreak the Opposition on this.In Brussels, Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, askedthe EU was going to be open to an extension, pointed out how Donald Tusk, the European Council President, would consider the next stage.\"As foreseen, the EU ambassadors meet this morning to take the next steps of the[EU] ratication and tomorrow I will await the European Parliament.\"He added: \"It was a very short and normal meeting of EU  ambassadors to launch the next steps of the ratication of the agreement.\""},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-labour-push-second-referendum-part-governments-brexit-deal","story":"And Sir Keir Starmer left open the possibility the party could back Boris Johnsons deala new national poll was attached to it.The Shadow Brexit Secretary insisted that any agreement approved by Parliament needed to be put to voters in a referendum and the party would back an amendment calling for one.The Labour heavyweight told BBCs The Andrew Marr Show: \"We need an amendment to say that whatever deal gets through, it should be subject to a referendum.\"We have already voted three times as a party for a second referendum with a three-line whip behind it.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amThe Scottish Association for Mental Healthis inviting Orcadians with lived experience of suicide to apply to take part in a new National Suicide Prevention: Lived Experience Panel.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Competitive pricing from hotels and other accommodation providers in Aberdeen has undoubtedly contributed to this, but that also acts as reassurance there are other options available for those who need it. Bookings are not being taken beyond the end of October, which is the intended date of closure subject to the outcome of our consultation with affected staff.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Targeting public transport is ideologically nonsensical but to do it at a time when irritable commuters are trying to make their way across heaving s is akin to having a death wish. Which is not to suggest the way the mob turned against the man standing on top of the train was acceptable merely that it could have been predicted by anyone who has spent time on the London Underground at rush hour.The misjudgment alienated workers who might in other, less volatile circumstances have been interested in a discussion about climate change. But it also allowed those right-wing commentators – the Brendan O’Neills and the Toby Youngs – to build on existing tropes of the campaigners as too middle class, too “elitist” and too extreme. The spectacle of the likes of Times columnist and Brexiteer Iain Martin positioning himself as the defender of “working class cleaners” would be hilariousit wasn’t so depressing. But these labels stick, especiallythe targets are stupid enough to engage in behaviour which perpetuates them. It’s dficult enough to take on governments and global corporations without handing their smirking henchmen the weapons with which to shoot you.Though the Canning Town protest brought matters to a dramatic head, criticism of the movement – its lack of a coherent ideology or strategy, its insensitivity to race and class issues its “the end of the world is nigh” catastrophising – have been a source of internal and external friction for a while.Extinction Rebellionhas been influenced by political scientist Erica Chenoweth who says . per cent of a population must take part in a campaign of civil disobedience to guarantee political change. In order to attract that . per cent, the movement has to be inclusive. However,you embrace a large cross-section – rich and poor, young and old, people from all ethnicities and political perspectives – it’s unrealistic to expect their views on causes, priorities or tactics to be aligned.There are many obvious fault lines in XR. There is the ide between those in the global north – where we are being urged to “think of the children” – and the global south, where the poorest are already directly being impacted by floods. There is a ide between those who can afford to pay a carbon tax on flights and those for whom it might mean the loss of their once-a-year package holiday.And then there is the ide between left and right between those anti-capitalists who would once have been in Occupy and “Malthusians” – like Rupert Read – who want to rein in large-scale immigration. The extent to which this obliviousness to potential “othering” has the capacity to damage XR can be seen in the furore over the flowers left for the police officers at Brixton Police station. It takes a gag-inducing dollop of white privilege not to associate Brixton Police station with the oppression of black communities or to understand that praising officers for their “decency and professionalism” might be considered offensive.The kind of climate change deniers who tweeted: “Please not Greta Thunberg” on the day the Nobel Peace Prize was due to be announced have already branded XR a Doomsday Cult. I would argue you can’t be a Doomsday “cultist” when the Doomsday scenario is rooted in science. But again XR sometimes behaves in a way that encourages this interpretation. It doesn’t help that co-founder Gail Bradbrook’s world view altered after she took mind-bending drugs on a retreat in Costa Rica. Nor that some of those involved are so Biblical in their presentation of future destruction. When Bradbrook declares  per cent of species will be dead within her daughter’s letime unless we all stop producing CO by , she sounds more like a wild-eyed prophet than a credible campaigner.This matters a lot. If the complaint about climate change deniers is they ignore science, then XR has to be rigorous in sticking to the facts. It should base its statements on demonstrable truths – the destruction of our coral reefs, rising sea water levels, plummeting insect numbers. And its demands should be realistic. If it is feasible to ask the UK to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by , fair enough, Butit is not – and many experts believe it isn’t – then they should focus on what can be achieved. Pushing for too much, too quickly is only going to wind up potential sympathisers.Talking of winding people up, XR leaders should use the tube station disaster as “a learning opportunity”. Civil disobedience is an important tool. It can raise awareness. It can force the hands of governments. But the targets have to be carefully chosen. Not the London underground. Or the BBC which – despite sometimes giving climate change deniers a  – devotes time to reporting the impact of extreme weather conditions.Those organising the protests ought to be mindful of workers’ routines and a balance ought to be struck between causing enough of a disturbance to make an impact and so great a disturbance it threatens livelihoods. And use some imagination. If you want to target public transport, don’t bring it to a standstill, forcing more people to use their cars make some statement about its cost or inefficiency. Alongside the civil disobedience, the movement would gain from demonstrating some grasp of the complexity of climate change: the way it intersects with capitalism and class and how –we do not guard against it – the solutions may entrench inequality rather than reverse it.Extinction Rebellion is right in principle. Climate change is the most important issue of our time. The consequences of not acting quickly enough will be seismic. It is not true, as Thunberg has implied, that governments are doing nothing but they are not doing nearly enough.To force them to change their ways requires a massive, but also a measured response. Martin Luther King – the inspiration behind much of XR’s thinking – orchestrated bus boycotts and marches. But he retained enough establishment respect to be accepted into the White House to talk to JFK and Lyndon B Johnson at least until the Civil Rights Act was signed into law. At the moment, the movement is making le easy for those naysayers who criticise XR’s tactics not because they have better ones, but because they want to push climate change off the agenda.If Extinction Rebellion wants to be taken seriously, it needs to be less scatter-gun. It needs to rein in its renegades and rid itself of racists who see those in the global south as “the problem” rather than as victims of colonialism. Saving the world is a lofty aim, but it won’t be achieved by alienating all those whose co-operation is neededthings are to change. It will be done by creating a consensus by persuading as many people as possible that radical, systemic change is not just desirable, but imperative.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

Thirteen people were killed.Flags with the regiment’s insignia and the words “We Support Soldier F” have been waved at football matches, draped over sidelines and hung from pub flagpoles.Band members on Orange Lodge marches in Scotland have also been spotted wearing Para berets.A range of Parachute Regiment items can be bought online from sites such as The Airborne Shop, which helps the Support Our Paras charity, and from the Parachute Regimental shop.

They do not. Our emblems are being used to incite violence and frighten Catholics.”Dave Scott, director of Nil By Mouth, Scotland’s leading anti-sectarian charity, said: “Sadly, we too often see fans at Scottish football matches bring flags, emblems and banners into grounds which have nothing to do with sport and everything too with antagonising others.“This is particularly the case with symbols of deep resonance across the Irish Sea. “It’s become a form of cultural voyeurism as I’d doubt any of those involved have any real experiences of the realities of that time. “As someone who grew up in Country Antrim I’ve always felt anyone who is in some way nostalgic for the Troubles clearly wasn’t there. “I’m not surprised those who have participated or have born witness to these events are aghast that people with very little,indeed any real knowledge of the complexities and emotions involved treat these symbols as little more than a red rag \u2028to a bull – a method of inflaming tensions or provoking responses from others.”A Scottish Professional Football League spokesman said they were unaware of such incidents including at the last Old Firm games.Edward Hyde, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said: “I’m not aware of any of our members wearing such regalia.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":null,"title":"caddy liners to be delivered to households","story":"Council will deliver caddy liner bags to Mid and East Antrim residents from October  for a two week period.These will be delivered on brown bins during this fortnight.

Typically dark , with intricate patterns, thebird is dficult to spot with the naked eye during the day. However, once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous.One of those who had the opportunity to view the bird last week was RSPB site manager, Brad Robson.He said: “It really is a fantastic bird. It sits on branches during the day and then at night it flies about hunting insects.“To see a Common Nighthawk is very rare indeed in fact it is the first one recorded in Northern Ireland. There have been sightings in Ireland on just a couple of occasions.”Its appearance in Ballymena has generated huge interest with bird watchers coming over from the UK to see it.Brad went on to explain that the bird is likely to have ended up in Ballymena due to the recent Storm Lorenzo.He said: “The Common Nighthawk breeds across North America and then they migrate to warmer parts of South America.“During that migration some will fly out over the coast. However, when you get these big powerful weather systems which you see across the Atlantic at this time of year some of those birds can get caught up in the storms. They are then whisked off across the Atlantic and one of their first landing stops can be Ireland.“When a bird is travelling in a weather system it cannot feed so the faster the weather system is across the Atlantic the more chance of it surviving the journey. Some birds will often rest on ships, however, that is unlikely to be the case with this bird.”Brad said that whilst the sighting in Ballymena is “very rare” the storm did bring a some American birds to Europe, causing a lot of excitement among bird watchers.He added: “It was great to see the Common Nighthawk flying about hoovering up the insects and I think everyone there was pleased to be able to see it so easily.”According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The common nighthawk measures . to . inches long and displays a wing span of to  inches. During migration, common nighthawks may travel , to , kilometres . According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the North Americas longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

knock out the power supply to the south east of England in the final years of its terror campaign, a former member has claimed..pushThe audacious plan is alleged to have come in the mid s, shortly before the Belfast Agreement peace accord.Former US Marine turned IRA gun runner John Crawley made the claim in a new programme, as part of a BBC series marking the th anniversary of the outbreak of the troubles in Northern Ireland.vkvh,,The seventh and final episode of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History explores the last IRA bombing campaign in England and the secret talks that brought it to peace.The IRA broke its  ceasefire in February  when it exploded a bomb in London’s docklands, which killed two people and caused an estimated £ million worth of damage.In June of the same year it exploded what was reported as the largest bomb to be planted in Great Britain since the Second World War.More than  people were injured in the blast in Manchester and signicant damage to infrastructure caused.The bombs came as Sinn Fein was at loggerheads with the UK Government and unionists over calls for the IRA to disarm before the Irish republican party would be admitted to peace talks.The latest Spotlight programme hears claims that the key IRA bombers had been either caught or killed after extensive surveillance operations by police and MI.Mr Crawley, who had previously been caught smuggling guns from the United States for the IRA, told the programme how he was arrested just before a plan to bomb London’s electricity supply was carried out.We were going to knock out the power supply of the south east of EnglandJohn Crawley“We were going to knock out the power supply of the south east of England,” he tells the programme.“And there may have been other operations after that, but we were caught before we could do that.”However he also claimed that the IRA had been left overstretched by the campaign.“I wondered why they didn’t kill us, because we’d have had men tooled up and everything,” he said.“They knew where we were going and to this day, I don’t know why they just didn’t take us out of it.“Because coffins coming back on the ferry would’ve been a nice message to anybody  looking to go.“And believe me, there wasn’t a lot of people putting their hands up to go to England.”caption goes hereJohn Grieve, who took over Scotland Yard’s anti-terror unit on the day of the Canary Wharf bomb, described Mr Crawley and the other IRA bombers as “the A team”.“They were absolutely excellent and one of them, John Crawley, ex-US Marine Corps demolition specialist, this was the top sort of people for them to bring up.“He just epitomised the cunning, skills, experience, of the sort of people they were putting against us,” he told the programme.The Troubles series has been described by the BBC as one of the “most signicant” produced by BBC Northern Ireland.To date it has reached more than . million people across the UK and has received more than . million requests on the BBC iPlayer.In Northern Ireland, more than half a million people have watched programmes in the series, with the fth episode the third most watched programme on BBC One Northern Ireland this year so far, after Line Of Duty and Strictly Come Dancing.The seventh and final episode of the series will be broadcast on Tuesday October  on BBC One NI and BBC Four at .pm.Meanwhile, Spotlight on

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about ghosts in the castle but during his time living there he never heard had any experience of them.ldquoAlthough the premises are licensed for spirits mdash I think they are of a dferent kind, he

in the new year, said Jim.ldquoThese will again be dferent bloodlines as a follow up to the making of a small but very well bred herd.ldquoCrossed with our own native goals they will produce a very tough healthy race of goats capable of yields upwards of two gallons, which is certainly well worthwhile.Jimrsquos present stud goat, Swaffham Salvador, was a reserve champion out of an entry of  goals at the Royal Norfolk Show.Jim has also imported a Soanen male whose dam was a Q Star goat breed champion.His other stud is a British Soanen bred over a gallon of milk with a minimum fat content of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it

As you would expect, the course had become a virtual mud bath by that stage and there was a lot of fallers.Finn Gibney ran well to take th place in the same boysrsquo race, which had a field of  finishers and Ky Murray also did well to take th place out of  finishers in the girlsrsquo race.Masters trialsThe weekend saw the Masters cross-country trials take place at the Queenrsquos playing fields. The weather was almost too good for it to feel like cross country with brilliant sunshine and little wind.The well kept grounds enticed one runner to go barefoot which was slightly disconcerting for the remainder wearing spikes, but maybe that was a tactic to get clear passage as the others were afraid to cause him injury.The conditions underfoot may have been kind, but the course was taxing with four long loops and a few rises and s where tactics played a part.Mark winsIt was no surprise to see Mark McKinstry, from North Belfast, surge into the lead from the go, given his recent form, but it was still impressive to watch how hard he continued to push despite the clear gap.Second overall was Eamon White, from the same club, with Glenn Donnelly, of Acorns AC, in third. As this race was a trial for selection for the NI team for the British and Irish XC International in Southport in November, all were out to seethey could do well enough in their age groups to merit a place.Three EDAC runners were in the mix. Neil Curran ran a great race, going out hard and hanging on mdash a tactic which worked extremely well. He was th overall and fourth in his age category, so stands a good chance of making the team.Martin Willcox, a previous NI team member at the international event, also put his hat in the ring with a gutsy run, coming th and third in his category which should see him nominated to race.Confirmation was not out at the time of writing, but we will keep our fingers crossed for them both. Gareth Reilly was th overall, getting his cross country season off to a solid start.Soggy SaintfieldAs rain swept in overnight and just kept coming, there was the danger of a wash out for the long awaited Saintfield  k, but runners are a resilient lot and so they turned up nonetheless, ready to enjoy the carnival atmosphere laid on by the hardworking members of Saintfield Striders and other coned volunteers.It was no secret that this is a tough route. Described as a challenge, the k started outside the cricket club, rises up into the town, rises again up Main Street and rises yet again after the left turn which takes the runners out into the countryside.Asthat wasnrsquot enough, there are at least three more hills which take their toll, but there are occasional down hills to catch your breath and the biggest compensation of all is the final mile and a half which drops down into the finish.Edie in frontThe pacers were encouraging and the marshals were cheery, so there was plenty to keep runners on track, whether they were chasing a time or just hoping to finish.EDAC had a small, but determined army. First home for EDAC was Edie Carroll, who thoroughly enjoyed the run and finished th overall and eighth female in a time of . which is more than respectable on that course.Kevin Kelly, who has racked up some great racing en route to Dublin Marathon, ran a PBwhich is a real boost in these last couple of weeks of his prep.Clare Carson, also in taper, produced a good time of ..

to -.That victory ensured Downpatrick of a play-off spot and also ped Bryansford into the relegation mire mdash Bryansford won their first meeting at St Patrickrsquos Park - to -.Saturdayrsquos confrontation will be a no holds barred confrontation.Derby affairs between these two old adversaries are always tasty and no quarter will be asked for or given at the weekend.Bryansford will rely heavily on the experience of Davy McKibben, Conor Maginn, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Timmy Hanna, with Downpatrick looking to Gerard Collins, the Turley brothers, Peter and Damian and Jarlath Branagan.Downpatrick received a massive boost last week when Conor McGrady, who was expected to miss the rest of the season, made a remarkably early comeback as a substitute in the game against Bryansford mdash his appearance from the start could be a game-changer on Saturday.Meanwhile, Downpatrickrsquos close neighbours will take on Saval in a Division  relegation play-off, also on Saturday at St Malachyrsquos Park and will act as a curtain-raiser to the ACFL  clash.Saul looked destined a few weeks back to join Tullylish and one other team in Division  next season, but last-gasp victories in recent weeks over Saval and then Darragh Cross on Saturday have given Ronan McCartanrsquos side a leline.Darragh did Saul a favour last Wednesday night when they beat Liatroim, effectively condemning the Fontenoys to Division .Saul mdash in their first season in Division  mdash have a mixed bag of youth and experience, but could well have to beat Saval without the services of the talented Cormac Byrne, out with a knee injury.However, in Cathail Arnold, Lorcan and Ciaran Harney, Pierce Laverty and Rory Mullen they have the players capable of producing the goods when it matters most.Elsewhere, Dromara play St John Bosco tonight in a Division  relegation play-off at Tullylish with the losers joining Glasdrumman in Division  next season.Bright embark on their initial Ulster Club Championship odyssey with a game against Cavan JFC winners Killinkere at Kingspan Breffni on Sunday andthey can replicate the form shown against Aughlisnafin in the JFC final.To complete a hectic weekend, the action s to Pairc Esler on Sunday where the MFC final replay between Kilcoo and Burren takes place with a .pm start..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo recapture Frank O’Hare Cup  ","story":"CILL Chua regained the Frank OrsquoHare Cup at Pairc Esler on Sunday with a relentless and masterful display of controlled football.The hurt of last yearrsquos defeat to Burren was confined to history as the Kilcoo players and supporters celebrated with unbridled joy on the final whistle.All credit to Warrenpoint for playing their part in an intriguing contest that so could easily have gone either way, but they were made to pay for registering  wides over the hour.As expected, Niall McAleenanrsquos side took the game to Kilcoo with real authority and at times threatened to destroy their vaunted opponents.However, you just canrsquot tie Kilcoo down and they steadfastly refused to be dominated for long periods.With just two minutes on the clock Ryan Mallon gave Warrenpoint the lead with a point from play after some patient approach work. The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him.

There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10538638.jpg","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our position has been clear and it has been consistent..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “DUP MPs supported the Letwin amendment as the only avenue available to properly scrutinise the deal on offer and attempt to secure changes that could address some of the concerns we have.”But Sir Reg Empey, the former UUP leader, claimed the DUP “have led us to this situation” where the country “lurches from crisis to crisis”.“They have proved to be out of their depth and find themselves in the farcical situation of now siding with arch remainers and Scottish nationalists to try and undo the damage of their own folly. With the influence they claimed to have had at Westminster, Northern Ireland should never have been put in this position,” said Sir Reg.“It was the DUP who cheered Boris Johnson  months ago at their party conference, and it is they who cheered him again three weeks ago at his party conference. What happened on each occasion  Boris threw them under a bus both times.”Mr Wilson, meanwhile, quashed any suggestions the DUP would support a second referendum.“The DUP does not seek a second referendum, merely implementation of the first,” he added.Meanwhile, Robin Swann says the DUP should learn their lesson and learn not to “rely on the word” of Boris Johnson in future.The UUP leader said: “The prime minister has demonstrated that his word is certainly not his bond. If the DUP should learn anything from this debacle, it is that they should never rely on the word of Boris Johnson. They were warned on several occasions. While they were feting Boris Johnson on the national stage, they took their eye off the ball and he mugged them. In doing so the prime minister was able to produce a deal which is hugely damaging to the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.“If the prime minister is in anyway sincere about serving the best interests of all four corners of the United Kingdom he should be engaging all the parties in Northern Ireland.”Tributes to Kingsmills Massacre widow Jean Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooNI man killed in awful incident -

It is a cynical political stunt, which has no prospect of leading to the formation of an Executive, but it will increase acrimony between parties and bring the chamber further into disrepute, making an actual restoration more dficult,” she said.“The intention of this recall is not to block abortion law and equal marriage, but to create the illusion the DUP are trying to do so. “Regardless of our inidual views on abortion, Alliance believes it is not appropriate to treat a serious issue with profound consequences in such a cynical matter and we want nothing to do with such a charade. It has already caused genuine fear and anxiety for those who believe a meeting of the Assembly will have any effect, including LGBT couples who have arranged marriages for next year..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “In addition, raising the expectations of the wider community that a sustainable Assembly can be formed without any intensive negotiations, compromise from the two largest parties, or reform of the institutions to make them fit for purpose is fundamentally dishonest. We will not be party to such a lie.“Alliance’s MLAs will be in Parliament Buildings on Monday, as they have been every week since the collapse of the institutions. Not only are we available for talks but we demand they start immediately. If those who signed this petition feel so strongly about the formation of an Executive and wish to take decisions, they must take responsibility for reaching a deal to deliver that. We are ready to play our part in forming an Assembly and Executive which is able to effect real change and make progress for everyone in our community.”Sinn Fein has already said it will not be attending Monday’s recall either, branding it a “stunt”. Thirty MLAs had signed recall petition ensuring the Assembly’s recall.

Wersquore trying to do something which is beneficial to the community.Dinas Powys Community Council and councillor Andrew Robertson have objected to the plans, raising fears over traffic and noise.Ms Church has said justone vehicle will be needed to take children to and from the school.She said: ldquoWe have sent out a letter to our neighbours in the hope they can come to usthey have any problems.ldquoWe had a really positive meeting. We talked about a lot of the issues regarding who has complained and itrsquos a very small group of people.ldquoAs compared to the picture painted for them by neighbours, [the council] were surprised at what we were doing and how compliant wersquore already being.ldquoWersquore hopeful of a positive outcome but we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen.ldquoWe have had thousands of messages of support from emails and twitter messages.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Also, many of the immigrant families are moving where due the uncertainty of their status on the outcome of Brexit.”However Mr Buckley said: ”It is very sad to see that unfortunately Richmount Playgroup has had to close its doors. I would like to pay tribute to the staff and community leaders who had the vision to open up the playgroup.“Having liaised and worked directly with the the Playgroup committee, parents and the education authority to try and save the playgroup it became clear that under the current low numbers it was going to be hard to sustain.“The committee took the decision to inform parents that the playgroup would be closing. I understand this has been dficult for parents and staff involved.“I must stress despite what is being reported, at no time was it indicated by the committee, parents or indeed the Education Authority that this decision was Brexit related.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
