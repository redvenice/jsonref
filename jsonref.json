Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Palmer left the company on Monday.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets, said the reaction from investors was “a pretty damning indictment of his tenure that the shares jumped this much after news of his sacking.”He added: “Aston Martin has been one of the worst stock listings in living memory. Things had already got pretty horrendous before this year the coronavirus outbreak has been the coup de grace.”Lawrence Stroll, a billionaire who became the executive chair of Aston Martin after leading a £536m rescue deal in March, said: “The board has determined that now is the time for new leadership to deliver our plans. On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Andy for his hard work, personal commitment and dedication to Aston Martin Lagonda since 2014.”The company’s chief manufacturing operations officer, Keith Stanton, will oversee operations until Moers takes up the top job.The change at the top comes after a difficult few months at Aston Martin. The British company, best known as the maker of James Bond’s cars, came close to going bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history.Over the weekend, Palmer told the Financial Times, which first reported the news, that he was unaware he was due to be sacked and declined to comment further.In the company statement to the stock exchange on Tuesday, Palmer said: “It has been a privilege to serve Aston Martin Lagonda for almost six years. The launch of many new products including the new DBX demonstrates the dedication and capability of our employees.“I would like to thank my management team and all the staff for their hard work and support, particularly during the challenges presented by Covid-19.”Aston Martin also announced the appointment of Peter Espenhahn as chair of the audit and risk committee and Lord Carrington as chair of the remuneration committee.Stroll agreed in recent weeks to inject more than £75m in short-term funding to enable the company to fight off a cash crunch as it battled stock market turmoil.Earlier this month, Aston Martin reported a loss of £119m for the first quarter of the year, which pushed its shares to a record low. The company said Moers had a track record of turning businesses around and Stroll added: “He is the right leader for Aston Martin Lagonda as we implement our strategy for the business to achieve its full potential.”Aston Martin, like other European carmakers, was forced to stop production for several weeks because of the coronavirus crisis. It closed its two factories at its main site at Gaydon in Warwickshire and its facility at St Athan in south Wales, which had been preparing to start production of its DBX SUV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6becae1b52304ff49c859c9ec55371d46b1e180/0_29_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=532b067fd4c37e317ef9455e1e74083e","title":"travel shares ftse 100 holiday british airways easyjet","story":"British Airways owner IAG and easyJet among those to rise as retail stocks also make gainsShares in airlines, holiday companies, pubs and cinema groups were among the biggest risers on London’s stock market on Tuesday morning, after the prime minister signalled plans to further reopen the economy from next week.Investors were boosted by Boris Johnson’s decision to set out a timeline for the reopening of outdoor markets and car showrooms in England from 1 June.

If the summer holiday season can be saved it would be a big plus after most of us wrote it off.”However, a continuing stock market rally depends on whether lockdown measures can be further eased, said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell: “Another key unknown is the extent to which a period in effective quarantine has affected consumer behaviour.

The Tory government risks a similar fateIt is not news that Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings treat rules with contempt. But there is one rule even they might be expected to obey, because it is crucial to the maintenance of power. Never, ever, make the people who place their faith in you feel like fools.Or, to put it another way, never let the people who think they are making a sacrifice realise that in fact they are the sacrifice. Before breaking this rule so flagrantly, Johnson and his consigliere would have done well to consider the fate of what used to be one of the most powerful institutions on these islands: the Irish Catholic church.Watching the Cummings road movie made me think, disturbingly enough, of my mother. She was, for almost all of her life, a devout Catholic – and it’s the “almost” that is most interesting. She was a kind and compassionate woman, and she did not judge other people. But she followed the rules. There was one rule in particular she found awfully hard: the church’s ban on contraception. But she believed in the authority of the church. She made the sacrifices, and did what she was told.I will never forget her rage and disgust when, in her late 70s and early 80s, she discovered that the same church she loved and obeyed had been covering up the sexual abuse of children for decades. She was revolted by those crimes, of course. But she also felt that the bishops had made a mockery of her faith. They made her feel gullible. Her belief that she and the people she looked up to were together in this thing, that they had shared a tough commitment and the pain it involved, had turned out to be a charade.She was not alone. And there was no going back from this moment of betrayal. The authority of the church melted away in the heat of this anger. For while people forgive their leaders a great deal – often far too much – there is no forgiveness for that terrible moment when you realise that the anguish you have endured for the greater good was, to those in authority, just a mark of your credulousness and inferiority.If Cummings were half as smart as he is supposed to be, he would have shown in his press conference some glimmer of understanding that this kind of betrayal is of a completely different order to the one he and Johnson engage in so routinely. The ordinary treachery of saying one thing and doing another – there will be £350m extra every week for the NHS there will never be a border in the Irish Sea – is mother’s milk to them. Perhaps because it is so habitual or because they are so used to getting away with it, their sense of how it works has become dulled. They missed the crucial fact that this time it’s different. This time it’s personal.The mundane duplicity that is Cummings’ and Johnson’s stock in trade comes with a knowing smirk: you didn’t really think we meant that literally, did you? It is part of an elaborate, highly performative, game. But the rules for collective survival in a pandemic are not ironic. They are intimate. They are embodied. They are the detailed texture of the lives we live every day. Like the rule that said Catholics must not use contraceptives, they inhabit people’s most private selves. You mock those selves at your peril.If we were all coolly rational creatures, the reasons why Cummings should not be anywhere near the levers of power in a self-respecting democracy would already have been abundantly clear. His contempt for law and order was obvious from Vote Leave’s flouting of funding rules in the 2016 Brexit referendum. His scorn for the very idea that he might be held to ordinary standards of public accountability was amply demonstrated by his literal contempt for a parliamentary committee looking into that abuse. But he got away with that stuff.So why does his odyssey during lockdown produce a whole different kind of emotion? Because it reaches into the innermost experiences of millions of people. It cuts right through to the pain of a loved one dying alone, of grandchildren growing distant, of precious human bonds being forcibly severed. It grabs hold of that torment and it squeezes the meaning out of it.We endure these things inidually because we understand ourselves to be also enduring them collectively. Cummings’ actions – and, even more, Johnson’s valorisation of them – strip away the second part. The big, communal and institutional structure that gives a value to the millions of inidual sacrifices has been kicked away – in Johnson’s defence of Cummings, the only value is the inidual “instinct” of the members of the ruling caste. To use the Blitz analogy that England apparently cannot escape, it’s fine to leave your lights on during the blackout if you’re an important person with documents to read.As the Catholic church found in Ireland, people don’t forgive this violation of the sense of meaning that gives dignity to their own sufferings. They don’t forgive because they can’t forget. This kind of betrayal is not just an event out there in the public world of media and politics and power. It is an experience that happens to every citizen inidually and privately. It is not possible for people to think about it without thinking of love and loss, of the grief they have felt and the intimacies they have foregone. To do so is to hear, as the soundtrack to the images stored from these months in the mind and the heart, an unpardonable snigger of elite condescension.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/279f1942fc2d274e2eae78a88cb0862d61d88cce/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05a9d4ead7fe72d02455e10130262758","title":"dominic cummings lockdown rules coronavirus","story":"A sense of shared responsibility has been crucial during the coronavirus crisis. Let’s hope it hasn’t been shatteredDuring his rose garden press conference, Dominic Cummings was asked if his trip to Durham had undermined government public health messaging. I hope not, he replied. Later, Boris Johnson was asked the same question. His response was more definitive: no one in No 10 has undermined the messaging. I hope they are right. For this matters. If people stop listening to what the government asks them to do and if they stop adhering to coronavirus measures then the number of infections will rise and more people will die.But I cannot be as certain or as optimistic as the prime minister and his adviser. All that we know about adherence (knowledge that behavioural scientists have repeatedly stressed to the government during the pandemic) suggests that damage has been done.First, for all the complexities of Cummings’ story, the bottom line is very simple. While millions of people up and down the land faced agonising personal circumstances and decided to stick with lockdown, Cummings did not. He went to Durham at the very time his government was insisting “stay at home, don’t travel”. He went to a beauty spot at the very time his government was insisting we avoid them. And nothing has happened to him. Instead, his actions have been endorsed. At the very least, that gives the appearance of “one rule for them, another for us” (possibly the best way of corroding trust in authority and adherence to the rules). And Cummings more than anyone else understands the importance of appearance in politics.Second, the one thing that has carried us through the pandemic so far has been an emergent sense of community. This “we” feeling has been critical in getting people to adhere to the restrictions, even when they personally were not at risk. It has been critical to all the volunteering and neighbourhood support that has helped us through hardship. It is the most valuable asset we have in a crisis. But the most notable thing about Cummings’ rose garden performance was that “we” was nowhere to be found. It was all about “I”.His explanation was entirely about his judgments as an inidual, his decisions, his personal concerns. At no point was there any thought to the impact of his actions on others. Still worse, in his defence of Cummings on Sunday, the prime minister seemed to endorse the idea that, when the going gets tough, it is fine to rely on your own judgments – and fine to follow your inidual “instincts”.In effect, Johnson’s defence of Cummings turned an issue of communal responsibility into an issue of inidual preference. Had everyone done that – had we all put so much energy into thinking about loopholes that served our personal circumstances rather than thinking about the impact of our actions on others – then lockdown would not have worked, the infection would still be raging and the NHS would have been overwhelmed.As we come out of lockdown these issues become, if anything, even more important. It isn’t that the infection has gone away. Rather we are now in a position, due to past sacrifices by the many, to use more targeted strategies against coronavirus. But these are dependent on us all maintaining physical distancing, increasing hygiene standards, revealing our contacts if infected and observing quarantine if contacted. All of these measures are personally inconvenient. Often it will be easier to ignore them. They will only work if we continue to act together and for each other.I hope this will happen. I hope people will continue to demonstrate the remarkable solidarity they have shown so far. I hope the collective spirit won’t be damaged. But this sorry affair doesn’t help, and the more they defend themselves, the more our top politician and his top adviser demonstrate that they don’t even appreciate what the problems are. • Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, an adviser to the UK and Scottish governments on coronavirus and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f61483d956a5b9b784807a246b0599f859afee89/244_246_2403_1441/master/2403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2f07086ddd3aa5c67fce9378253f6d","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of minimal","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘minimal’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘minimal’.Share your photos of what minimal means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 May at 10am.

Today, 42 pupils are in.At the moment there is one teacher to four students, which means pupils such as Caitlin can be given unprecedented tailored pastoral and academic support, without the usual pressures of time. “I think without school right now I’d be an emotional mess,” Caitlin says with a nervous smile. “It’s my GCSEs and I’m worried – we’re missing a massive chunk of learning. But I’ve had a teacher to help me whenever I’ve wanted. It’s given me that extra confidence.”Here at Rednock, pupils have been encouraged to try a huge range of new creative and practical activities: knitting, Zumba, TikTok, baking, kite-making and sign language.The school has ripped up timetables in a way no state school could normally contemplate. “We’ve said, we will be completely flexible to your needs,” says Kerala Cole, assistant headteacher. “We work in partnership with parents to personalise the deal for the students. It can be that they come in for just a couple of hours. And I think we are seeing huge benefits to that.”One boy who had refused to attend for eight months, has been coming in every day, thanks to this flexibility and the attention he can now be given. Another year 8 child, “who arrived midway through this year and has been struggling … he’s been attending for four weeks now and he’s really benefited”, says Cole. “You can just see how his shoulders have relaxed.”The gap in GCSE results between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest is thought to be around 19 months and, without changes in policy priorities, at the current rate it will take 50 years to close, according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank.Many fear children will fall even further behind during the pandemic, one reason the government gives for wanting to reopen schools to more pupils by 1 June. Rednock was hoping some 240 pupils would attend during lockdown, but numbers have been lower than expected.The corridors of the school’s spacious modern building are hushed. Children walk around alone, and don’t wear uniform. For many, “strange school” has huge advantages. “Before, I had quite a few classmates who were really annoying and distracting, but now this new way, it’s quieter,” says Edie, 13.“Teachers are ever so supportive, and it’s calmer because there’s not tonnes of people crowding around,” adds Molly, 11.“There’s less people who intimidate other people,” says Alfie, 12, whose parents, both nurses, have been at work during the crisis. “You can be yourself more rather than be the person other people think you should be.” His mum has had Covid-19, he says, and has recovered.Everyone nods. “Before, people used to sometimes judge you,” says Samira, 11. “You can sometimes have fake friends who really bring you down. This has given you a little bit of a break.”Because the school is being so careful about physical distancing, I meet students in the hall, with one child per desk. This small group either have key-worker parents, are under the care of a social worker, have an education, health and care plan (EHCP) for their special needs, or are otherwise defined as “high priority” by their teachers. They miss their friends but, to a child, say they feel immense relief from the pressures of “normal” school.“The teachers have more time to spend with you, and you get the help you need,” says Maisie, 12, whose mother works in food manufacturing. Samira agrees. “Teachers feel more like family now.” There is enthusiastic nodding from her schoolmates.The headteacher, David Alexander, and Cole, went through their entire roll to identify pupils they felt should have the opportunity to attend – those who were vulnerable, although not in the government’s stated categories.“We want as many to come in as possible,” Alexander says. As schools closed across the country, Rednock staff telephoned 280 families to make sure they knew their child had a place. “Some parents and carers are hesitant,” Alexander acknowledges. “And some prefer to have their children at home.” But efforts are unstinting to support the 160 or so students who, Cole says, “we would class as vulnerable, and who we’d prefer to be in school but aren’t”.Cole feels anxious for the welfare of some children who haven’t been seen for the past seven weeks. She is in regular contact with their social workers and, in some cases, the police. Teachers continue to check in, ringing some children weekly, some daily. In school, staff are sensitive to new needs. “Some here have really difficult home lives and they feel safer in school. And they feel worried about their parents who are at work. We’ve had tears, shouting, aggression,” says Cole.“Or they go quiet, or go off on their own,” adds Alexander. “Or you get over-the-top laughter, or clinginess,” says Cole.When all students do come back, Alexander and Cole are hoping there will be lessons they can use from lockdown. They know, too, that the return of the hurley burley will affect the more vulnerable children.And the pupils have mixed feelings about normal school resuming. Samira hopes there might be smaller classes, but says: “I’m not excited about going back – all the madness and screaming in corridors.” Molly agrees.: “It’ll probably be more stressful. Everything crowded again.”Caitlin is looking to the positives. “I’ve had the opportunity to reflect on who I want to be when I’m older,” she says. “I can be quite negative, and this time has given me a break. The extra support from school means that I know even when things get tough – because we’re in a pandemic and I’m getting through it – I can get through other things now.”Alexander and Cole emphasise that even in normal times this school tries to create a family atmosphere. But to these children, a caring school has never felt as much of a reality as it does now. There is no testing or targets, no pressure to achieve academically. They feel adults are there for them. And despite the immense stresses and limitations of living in a time of pandemic, they are blossoming.* All children’s names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e4ffa324fb65ac4495cbfcd028f1042181eb14/0_35_4019_2411/master/4019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96ab75958092b2bad0ccd6d2d0858d00","title":"food waste firm bags oprah winfrey and katy perry as investors","story":"US startup Apeel Sciences raises further $250m to help tackle supply chain disruption﻿A Californian startup that pioneered a high-tech solution to reducing food waste has secured personal investment from Oprah Winfrey and Katy Perry in its latest fundraising drive.Perishable produce such as avocados, lemons and limes stay ripe for twice as long as usual due to an edible spray-on coating on their skin made from plant materials and devised by Apeel Sciences.On Tuesday, the company announced it had raised further capital of $250m (£203m), led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Government of Singapore Investment Corporation GIC to help finance its expansion and tackle the disruption to the global food supply chain caused by Covid-19.This year, the company said it is due to save 20m pieces of fruit from going to waste at retail outlets, while also extending shelf-life in the home, where food waste rates are three times as high.James Rogers, the Apeel Sciences founder and chief executive, said: “Food waste is an invisible tax imposed on everyone that participates in the food system. Eliminating global food waste can free up $2.6tn annually, allowing us to make the food ecosystem better for growers, distributors, retailers, consumers and our planet. We’re putting time back on the industry’s side to help deal with the food waste crisis and the challenges it poses to food businesses.”The food technology startup was founded in 2012 with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help reduce food waste in developing countries without access to refrigeration. It works with exporters to treat fresh produce before it is transported around the world. Globally, almost a third of all the food produced, approximately 1.3bn tonnes, is wasted every year.First used commercially in the US in 2018, the coating has helped to more than halve supermarkets’ fresh produce waste. It is also being used elsewhere, including in large supermarket chains in Germany and Denmark the UK is due to follow this year. Asda carried out consumer trials last autumn on mandarins from Peru and tests on cucumbers, which could dispense with the need for plastic wrapping.The company’s new investors, Winfrey and Perry, live in Santa Barbara, near its headquarters in Goleta. Winfrey is an avocado aficionado and has an orchard at her Californian home.Apeel tested the technology on avocados because of their short period of perfect ripeness and relatively high price. It has opened satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey. It works with five suppliers of avocados, including two of the world’s largest, Del Monte and Del Rey.Although helping US and European produce suppliers and retailers will remain a priority, Apeel’s new funding will help it support farmers and communities in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, which are at greater risk of food security issues.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274312b947acca798a64e70ac6cca123ef4eac8/0_279_2726_1635/master/2726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c560998e80c0297cc0aee20935baee","title":"rylan clark neal i regret pretty much everything i wore on the x factor","story":"The TV presenter on finally being able to dress the way he wants to, and the importance of talking about cosmetic work I regret pretty much everything else I wore on that show.

The wounds were still too fresh, some argued. Turning a national tragedy into something a person can pay $12 to watch while shoveling popcorn down their gullet struck detractors as perverse, though critics spilled a goodly amount of e-ink debating the actual merits of the work itself. The conversation trafficked in shades of grey, but it posed a clear question: when is it appropriate to start dramatizing an intimately terrible chapter of recent history?If the parties at the vanguard of the emerging coronasploitation cinema genre called the shots regarding the timeline on our collective creative processing of 911, pre-production would have launched between the fall of the first and second towers. It would appear that any trepidation about being too soon has been supplanted by a fear of being too late.Five years separated the United States’ last generation-defining catastrophe and its first Hollywood treatment, and yet hardly five seconds could elapse before the film industry went to work on The Great American Coronavirus Movie. No fewer than a half-dozen projects in various stages of development are already endeavoring to capture the chaos, the uncertainty, the sadness, and the hope for an America in need of inspiring. Though of course, that’s the most generous assessment – one can surmise that the minds behind Corona Zombies didn’t set out to heal the soul of a nation.That film, slapped together in record time by redubbing footage from an old Italian grindhouse flick and splicing it with news broadcasts for timeliness, represents the bottom of this particular barrel. The reek of cashing-in emanates most strongly from those productions wholeheartedly embracing their B-movie origins, such as the “The Ultimate Lockdown Film” 19 Covid Lane, a winking ripoff of 10 Cloverfield Lane in concept and design.Though Keshvari rushed through a three-day shoot before social distancing protocols ramped up, the bigger treatments still to come will have to contend with harsher restrictions. It’s been announced that Sliding Doors director Peter Howitt will tackle the pandemic as an Irwin Allen-style ensemble piece, tracking seven lives across Los Angeles over the course of 60 days. The Deadline exclusive breaking the news mentions that the producers are “eyeing” a launch of principal photography in September 2020, by which time they’re presumably banking that things will have returned to relative normalcy. Whether that’s an unduly optimistic start date will be determined in time, but even if that’s how the chips fall, it won’t be business as usual by any means.Michael Bay and the other producers behind the gestating Songbird plan on forging ahead, viral threat be damned. A report last week on Deadline detailed a schedule that has shooting commencing in five weeks’ time, employing novel means to make working on the streets of Los Angeles safe for the actors and crew. While the article refrains from specifying how that could possibly work, there’s mention of “remote training” for actors. More importantly, the guilds responsible for looking after the well-being of performers and craftspeople have all given the okay for these mystery methods. While a half-dozen issues immediately come to mind – how unmasked actors can share screen time, maintenance of proper distance for crew during takes, getting everyone fed when the craft services table provides a breeding ground for germs – some industry insiders are busying themselves figuring it all out.The most eyebrow-raising notice comes from the horror factory Blumhouse, where the top brass have been devising a new approach to working on a studio lot. They’re full steam ahead on a $6.5m genre picture to be shot on Universal’s sound stages, with a “set of safety protocols” in place. The specifics include an end to the craft services table, and more notably, putting up all of the cast and crew in a single hotel to contain the flow of contagions. A quote from a source at Universal makes clear that “Blumhouse and Universal aren’t moving forward with any plans until we get the green light from city, county and public-health officials.” However, the risk remains so great that no insurance company will agree to cover the production. If disaster strikes – as it did not so long ago, when Paul Walker died while working on Universal’s Furious 7 – Blumhouse and Universal will be left with a massive financial liability.Whether new laws change that much will number among the deciding factors in the evolution of a post-viral industry. That article from the Hollywood Reporter delves into the legal muck of this sticky situation, theorizing that Democrats in Congress will push new legislation requiring insurers to offer virus policies. That will be a long and arduous fight, however, with insurance corporations expected to push back as hard as possible on a mandate they see as setting them up for failure. Even if the film industry isn’t following its own example of post-911 delicacy, they’re hoping those chaotic days can still provide a precedent today in Washington following much debate and acrimony, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was passed in 2002 to force insurers to cover the eventuality of terrorist attacks.But there’s a disparity between the crisis that opened the millennium and the crisis unfolding now, a factor making them comparable and yet different enough that there would be no waiting period for Covid cinema. The vast majority of Americans related only symbolically to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a broadside against America that we all were supposed to fight as vicarious patriots. Everyone feels a sense of ownership over the coronavirus quagmire, because it has affected every single citizen’s life in an immediate, perceptible way. This has freed up Hollywood (and the wannabes lurking around its fringes) to claim these stories as their own for the telling. But that ubiquity is a double-edged sword. If we all share in custody of the story’s drama, we all share its hazards as well. Any film-maker hoping to capitalize on the fact that we’ve all been touched by the virus must also accept that that leaves the possibility of having been literally touched by the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e813637f5025b7a59e29718be5a0eda7d8d3ab2a/0_26_4638_2783/master/4638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2883e0d24402adf38982e2d51cfaf96","title":"michael moore film planet of the humans removed from youtube","story":"British environmental photographer’s copyright claim prompts website to remove film that has been condemned by climate scientistsYouTube has taken down the controversial Michael Moore-produced documentary Planet of the Humans in response to a copyright infringement claim by a British environmental photographer.The movie, which has been condemned as inaccurate and misleading by climate scientists and activists, allegedly includes a clip used without the permission of the owner Toby Smith, who does not approve of the context in which his material is being used.In response, the filmmakers denied violating fair usage rules and accused their critics of politically motivated censorship.Smith filed the complaint to YouTube on 23 May after discovering Planet of the Humans used several seconds of footage from his Rare Earthenware project detailing the journey of rare earth minerals from Inner Mongolia.Smith, who has previously worked on energy and environmental issues, said he did not want his work associated with something he disagreed with. “I went directly to YouTube rather than approaching the filmmakers because I wasn’t interested in negotiation. I don’t support the documentary, I don’t agree with its message and I don’t like the misleading use of facts in its narrative.”Planet of the Humans director Jeff Gibbs said he was working with YouTube to resolve the issue and have the film back up as soon as possible.He said in a statement: “This attempt to take down our film and prevent the public from seeing it is a blatant act of censorship by political critics of Planet of the Humans. It is a misuse of copyright law to shut down a film that has opened a serious conversation about how parts of the environmental movement have gotten into bed with Wall Street and so-called “green capitalists.” There is absolutely no copyright violation in my film. This is just another attempt by the film’s opponents to subvert the right to free speech.”Planet of the Humans, which has been seen by more than 8 million people since it was launched online last month, describes itself as a “full-frontal assault” on the sacred cows of the environmental movement.Veteran climate campaigners and thinkers, such as Bill McKibben and George Monbiot, have pointed out factual errors, outdated footage and promotion of myths about renewable energy propagated by the fossil fuel industry. Many are dismayed that Moore – who built his reputation as a left-wing filmmaker and supporter of civil rights – should produce a work endorsed by climate sceptics and right-wing thinktanks.Several have signed a letter urging the removal of what they called a “shockingly misleading and absurd” documentary. Climate scientist Michael Mann said the filmmakers “have done a grave disservice to us and the planet” with distortions, half-truths and lies.On Moore’s official YouTube channel, the usual link to the film has been replaced by a page noting “Video unavailable. This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by a third party.” On the Planet of the Humans website, the link to the full movie is also dead, though the trailers and other video material are functioning as normal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6a039f5d5953b613d87539b28ad1551100d01f/0_0_7081_4248/master/7081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f59fd676737be550a0d9472da44511","title":"move over potato salad the best veg side dishes for a barbecue kitchen aide","story":"It’s not only meat that benefits from the application of direct heat – vegetables are also transformed by fire and smoke• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theI find barbecue sides uninspiring. Any tips for a good veg dish that isn’t potato salad?Dan, London E13First to get up in your grill, Dan, is live-fire cook Genevieve Taylor. But before we go any further, we must address your potato salad takedown. “Grilling potatoes on the barbecue is a really lovely thing to do,” counters Taylor, who wrote Charred: The Complete Guide to Vegetarian Grilling and Barbecue. She cuts new potatoes into wedges, grills them slowly until crisp on the outside, then adds “an Italian-style olive-oil-based dressing and basil” while they are still warm. “Pretty much every veg you can think of is boosted with a little bit of smoke and fire,” says Taylor. The beauty of cooking this way, she says, is that you can layer textures, flavours and colours in a way that you can’t with meat: “I might start with a base of root veg, such as carrots, which always benefit from a little blanch first to open up the cell walls so you can then hit them with a marinade, such as cumin, garlic and chipotle chilli. Then grill them until charred in places and nice and sticky.” Taylor layers them with herbs, spring onions, nuts and ricotta.Whole cauliflowers have become a barbecue’s best friend, but only when blanched first, then cooked slowly. “A lot of vegetables take longer to cook on the barbecue than you might imagine,” says Taylor. “My top tip is to set up your barbecue so that you have different zones of heat – only put charcoal on one side of the barbecue, so that you have the option to cook indirectly or directly over the fire.”Taylor cooks the cauliflower over an indirect heat until tender, then slides it over the fire to caramelise. Then, says Georgina Hayden, the author of Taverna, it is all about the finishing touches. She tosses her cauliflower in a mix of tahini, yoghurt, garlic, lemon and olive oil, then adds herbs andor chilli. This works well with broccoli, too.Vinegar is a useful tool to contrast that charcoal flavour, says Neil Campbell, the head chef at Rovi in London: “Try slicing white onions, mixing with apple cider vinegar, sugar and salt, then leaving to sit. Lightly grill some asparagus and green beans, then chop and toss them in the vinaigrette and throw in some basil.” Onion also makes a cracking side to meat: “Cut red onions in half (skin on), then cook face down until they are pretty much black, then slip them off the direct heat and cook skin side down so they sweat and steam.” Once they are done, Campbell removes the skin, slices the onions and adds Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.To spice things up, look for inspiration from cultures where fire cooking is prevalent, says Taylor: “Indian tandoor cooking, Mexico or south-east Asia, for all those wonderful marinades with lemongrass, lime leaves and coriander.” And if you have some citrus fruits knocking around, toss them on to the grill, too, then squeeze over veg before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76f550937bb4bbd48a791a623ecdf1e69aaf16b6/0_2477_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373f81fa13ec2e5116704a40a77de64a","title":"nigel slater recipe for green and cheese","story":"You won’t be able to resist this warming veggie midweek dishSoftened onions, a lovingly made sauce and some grated cheese is the perfect base in which to use up any leafy, thick-stemmed greens.Pour 500ml of milk into a saucepan, add a couple of bay leaves, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, half a dozen peppercorns and half a small onion.

From Gauntlet to Diablo, this genre has always featured dank subterranean lairs, treasure chests and warrior skeletons – all beloved Minecraft components. The signature blocky visuals also work well, ensuring that Minecraft Dungeons will look familiar to fans as they hurtle through dioramas of hack-and-slash fun that rearrange themselves each time you play.The plot is paper thin: a vengeful loner discovers a treasure that turns him into a powerful mage and duly begins a reign of terror over the Minecraft kingdom. The game can be played alone, but it is most enjoyable to play its co-op mode, which can be enjoyed on a console or online. In this mode players work together to bring down waves of skeletons, slime monsters, and giant spiders, reviving fallen allies as they go. With four players taking part, each equipped with magical weapons, the screen is soon awash with arrows, explosions, lightning bolts and freeze rays in a confusing but exciting light show. As Gauntlet veterans will recall, it’s the hidden rhythms of this genre that are really delightful the anticipation of the next wave of enemies, the anarchy of battle, then the delicious gluttony of loot collection.Fighting is highly intuitive – one button for melee attacks, one for ranged weapons. You start with a basic sword and bow, but soon unlock more powerful weapons such as spears, battle hammers and rapid-fire crossbows. You can also earn enchantments for your weapons, giving them new attacks – a poison cloud or lightning strike, for example. Armour and artefacts imbue you with their own special abilities, from lasers to healing auras. The generous cornucopia of defensive and attacking options add a rich seam of strategy and planning to the chaos of the levels.From the first encounter with a cute skeletal archer to the final mega battle against the Arch Illager himself, Minecraft Dungeons is a delightful thrill ride of a dungeon game. The levels are filled with detail, from lush pixellated woodlands to deep red stone caverns where clattering mine carts rush through the narrow tunnels and torches flicker on craggy walls. Each level has a clear path to the end, but there are plenty of side routes to explore, along with whole cast of baddies and bosses including the terrifying Endermen, accompanied by horror movie music, and necromancers who generate hordes of zombies.Minecraft Dungeons is enlivened by a sprightly, varied score, theatrical sound effects and many references to the original Minecraft. If you aren’t charmed by the baby zombies rushing at you, arms outstretched, or by the collectible anthropomorphic dungeon keys that run away in terror when you’re attacked, then you have had your soul extracted by a sorcerer.Minecraft Dungeons isn’t exactly an epic challenge. You’ll be able to complete a basic run-through in an evening, though escalating difficulty levels bring up ever more powerful and interesting weapons and items. Plus, as the levels are partly random, they’re never quite the same when you return, adding to the replay value.

The country’s poor treatment of Roma and Gypsy children was criticised while the UK’s anti-terrorism strategy, Prevent, was found to have a stigmatising effect on Muslim children.British children’s views were not systematically heard in developing policy that affects them, the report found. It also highlighted concerns around lack of legal aid while many children feel they are not listened to by social workers, paid carers, judges and other professionals working in family legal proceedings.Chad has fallen behind Afghanistan to reach the bottom of the rankings while Sierra Leone has the third worst result.The advocacy group’s chairman, Marc Dullaert, told the  the pandemic would have a dire impact: “Our index shows that even before Covid-19, countries were not allocating sufficient budgets around the protection of child rights. Now we expect the economic consequences of the crisis to turn the clock back 10 years on the progress made around the wellbeing of children, unless governments take swift action.”Countries are scored using UN data and evidence collected from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. They are assessed across five areas including health, education, and enabling an environment that promotes child rights.“Overall, we see two big red flags in the findings this year,” said Dullaert. One is lack of government funding around children’s health, education and protection.The other is around the discrimination of children with more than a third of countries having the lowest possible score in this area.“We see in 91 of 182 countries that girls do not have the same rights as boys in terms of inheritance rights, access to education and equal treatment in legislation. It is not only in developing countries that there is a problem with discrimination.”Italy ranked 15th in the index, up from 74, after being commended for adopting laws on cyberbullying and protecting children with disabilities. It was criticised for smear campaigns against organisations helping migrants.The index is not an absolute ranking of countries where children have the best life but nations are scored relative to their capacity to implement children’s rights.“Once we take this into account, surprising rankings might occur,” said Professor Karin Arts, of the International Institute of Social Studies, who was among those who compiled the data.“Examples are the ultra-low scores of Australia (135), New Zealand (168) and the UK (169), and the high ranks of Thailand (8) and Tunisia (17),” she said.Australia has dropped from 19 last year to 135 because of the poor treatment of refugee and migrant children, as well as Aboriginal young people who were found to be discriminated against in ways that affected their rights to education and health.Dullaert said: “It is really sad to see that recent welfare reforms have pushed more children into poverty in a rich country like the UK. We are also concerned about children in detention who, because of the indirect impact of Covid-19, are effectively in solitary confinement and have nearly no contact with family or the outside world.”The Kidsrights Foundation said the fallout from measures taken by governments to reduce the spread of Covid-19 would have lasting effects on children globally.School closures in 188 countries affect 1.5 billion children, leaving them vulnerable to child labour, child marriage and teenage pregnancy.“Millions of children were out of school for a long period and we see especially in developing countries that, even after the easing of lockdown, there is an enormous drop-off rate, with large numbers of children failing to return to school again,” said Dullaert. “As with the Ebola crisis, this will result in more children being put into work and early marriages for girls.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=80f565094aea3b82cabbd0095f1a1dd5","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

He was ill for 10 days, then recovered. He’s usually a crazily prolific songwriter – two of his band’s most celebrated albums, 50 Song Memoir and 69 Love Songs, obviously contain 119 songs between them – but he hasn’t come up with any new numbers since he got ill. The problem is that he can only write songs in bars. And not just any bar – it needs to be “one-third full of cranky old gay men gossiping over thumping disco music”. Plus he needs a glass of cognac, to be slowly sipped, and a corner with a light so he can see his notebook.Fortunately, before the outbreak, he was able to find a place that fulfilled these conditions and the result is the Magnetic Fields’ latest album. Like most of Merritt’s records, there’s a concept – on this one, titled Quickies, all the songs but one are two minutes 15 seconds or less. However, that’s not an unusual length for a Magnetic Fields tune – as Merritt points out over the phone, one-third of the songs on 69 Love Songs would qualify.Is it ingrained in him that this is the perfect length for a pop song? “It’s ingrained in everyone in Gen X or earlier,” he says. “It used to be that seven-inch singles were 2 mins 50 in length maximum – this is before Bohemian Rhapsody and such epics were considered singles.” It’s much more rare for him to write a song that lasts around five minutes. “That’s long to me, yes, both in my tastes and musical output. I like bubblegum and experimental music so I’m comfortable with two minutes and I’m comfortable with six hours.”This is a relatively loquacious answer for Merritt, whose laconic baritone has had many interviewers tearing their hair out. When I mention his long-standing interest in brevity – he co-wrote a book, 101 Two-Letter Words, with the New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast, inspired by the shortest words you can use in Scrabble – his entire answer is: “Hm.”He’s hilarious, if you don’t mind protracted awkward silences – a man of passionately held, if quietly expressed, views. Don’t get him started on bonus tracks. “I’ve always hated bonus tracks. The whole idea bugs me. Either it’s an album or it’s not an album. It gets my Asperger’s up to even think about it.” Does he really have Asperger’s? “I don’t know, I refuse to ask for a diagnosis, but my various friends with Asperger’s swear I do, yes.”As well as brevity, it’s Merritt’s way with a lyric that makes the songs on Quickies extraordinary. It’s hard to imagine anyone else writing tracks called You’ve Got a Friend in Beelzebub, I Wish I Were a Prostitute Again and The Biggest Tits in History. Merritt says that I Wish I Were a Prostitute Again is something a couple of his friends have regularly lamented. “They both harp on it a lot. I have heard a whole lot of the lyrics to this song verbatim. But clearly it’s an exaggeration of what they actually do.” (The song includes dressing up as King Tut, Betty Boop and the Turin Shroud and selling one’s “urine” and “poop”.)Then there’s the song The Day the Politicians Died, which describes global revelry breaking out in response to the event of the title. A bit extreme? “It’s a little less extreme than what I think about politicians,” Merritt counters. “It would be illegal for me to express my actual political opinions in probably any country in the world, and I definitely wouldn’t be allowed to travel.”He pauses – again – and then elaborates. “In reaction to Donald Trump’s suggestion that people ingest disinfectants, Howard Stern suggested that there should be a Trump rally in which his supporters drink disinfectants and, quote, all drop dead, unquote. I admire Howard Stern for being able to say these things and keep his job. I also completely endorse that sentiment.”Magnetic Fields fans know more about Merritt than we usually would about a musician. His previous album, 50 Song Memoir, had a lyric about each year in his life (he’s now 55) and detailed everything from his eccentric mother – who gave away all her money and joined new-age cults around the US, dragging her son with her – to the many odd illnesses he has been plagued with. The most debilitating is hyperacusis, an acute sensitivity to certain sounds, which would make it impossible for Merritt to play with an amplified rock band – Magnetic Fields gigs are much quieter affairs.Merritt believes he all but destroyed his hearing watching the industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten play a gig in New York in the early 80s. When I interviewed him 16 years ago for the cult gay magazine Butt, a publication for which he also posed naked, he told me: “I was standing too close to the circular saw being scraped across corrugated metal, and listening to the incredible sounds in my own ear of what I now realise was my hearing being damaged.”Though Quickies is mainly fiction – one song is called I Wish I Had Fangs and a Tail – Merritt’s life has still informed it. I note that there are two songs about the sinful allure of dancing (Evil Rhythm and The Price You Pay) and suggest that dancing is a theme on the record. “And all other popular music, yes,” comes the reply.Merritt takes pity on me and elaborates. “When I was young I lived against my will on a Tibetan Buddhist commune in Vermont, where music was forbidden. Music distracts you from enlightenment or something. But I was – also against my will – made to grow up in Boston for a while, which had a long history of Puritanism where all sorts of things have been banned, one of those being music, another being theatre, and I am heir to all sorts of Puritanical impulses. Also, my mother was a radical feminist acolyte of Mary Daly who I have relentlessly satirised in a number of songs, including Kill a Man a Week” – another song on Quickies. “That’s really not an exaggeration of Mary Daly’s actual opinion, it’s only a reductio ad absurdum but not actually an exaggeration.”The Magnetic Fields’ first single came out in 1991 by the late 90s Merritt’s songwriting was already revered in the music press, before 69 Love Songs, released in the US in 1999, showcased the range of Merritt’s talents to a wider public. Ranging from songs about horny puppies to sharp attempts to fathom the nature of love itself, it’s still a monumental record that is destined to overshadow the rest of Merritt’s work – which he doesn’t mind, since that was the intention. Like all his records, it ranged stylistically from folk to jangly post-punk, to Fleetwood Mac-inspired AOR and even Ace of Base-style Swedish reggae, though some genres – particularly rock – are always off-limits.Quickies, of course, is being released in the teeth of the pandemic, and Merritt is brutal about the implications for his career. “We’ve already postponed our US tour from June to January and I don’t know if January’s realistic at this point. So it may have simply ended my concert career, we don’t know.”What would happen if you couldn’t play live? “Well, I would probably have to get a job. But I would actually be relieved that I didn’t have to perform any more because I’ve never been a big fan of performing.” Like most musicians, Merritt won’t be able to get by on streams and record sales alone: “The money in the music industry is mainly in concerts at this point.”It all spells trouble for gigging musicians. “Medium-size mass gatherings will be the last thing to come back,” he predicts. “I see no reason why there can’t be big outdoor festivals, but we really really don’t do big outdoor festivals – we have a cello. Although I guess we could just have the cellist switch to bass guitar.”And then you could rock out, I joke – since if the choice was between making rock music and surviving, or staying pop and perishing, Merritt would choose the latter every time.“I don’t begin to know where to go with that,” he replies.• Quickies is out now. The vinyl version, on five seven-inch EPs, is out on 29 May, as is the CD."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

But his press conference left questions unanswered – and also caused a degree of bafflement.1 Why not try other options?Dominic Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, have family in London. But he said that they explored no other options before settling on their trip to Durham. Why not?Did Cummings consider whether there was any risk that his wife’s trip to hospital in Durham with the couple’s son could take Covid-19 on to the site? Did he consider whether the difficulty of getting an immediate taxi was sufficient reason for him to drive to the hospital when he could “barely stand up” the night before?If Cummings had concerns over whether his eyesight was good enough to drive to London, why was he confident enough to drive 30 miles to Barnard Castle, with his wife and son in the vehicle?4 How extreme was the risk?The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said that the only reason to travel with coronavirus in search of childcare was if there was an extreme risk to life. Did the family’s situation constitute such a risk?5 Why not talk to the media earlier?Cummings said that the media had been told things were wrong but “repeatedly reported them anyway”. How does he reconcile this account with Downing Street’s refusal to engage with attempts by the  and Daily Mirror to seek comment for more than six weeks? Why did Downing Street only issue comments after the publication of key articles by the two newspapers?6 When was the walk in Durham?Cummings said that he took a walk in the second week of his stay in Durham “after I started to recover”. That would suggest he still had some symptoms. The Public Health England guidance on outdoor exercise changed that week and by 9 April all outdoor exercise was prohibited for those with symptoms. So when exactly did the walk take place?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/601d7fbfd24549094fdb3900431a2763972c7adc/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3eee2fbf12188f8c5e496e1fdabeefe9","title":"can coronavirus affect eyesight evidence is lacking say experts","story":"Medics including Royal College of Ophthalmologists say cases of impaired vision alongside coronavirus infection ‘rare’See all our coronavirus coverageSpeaking to the press on Monday, Dominic Cummings said he drove, with his wife and child, on a 30-mile trip to Barnard Castle during lockdown to see if he could drive safely, concerned that his eyesight might have been affected by coronavirus.In a press conference later the same day, Boris Johnson also claimed to have experienced problems with his eyesight following Covid-19, brandishing a pair of glasses and saying: “I’m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years … I think that’s very, very plausible that eyesight can be a problem associated with coronavirus.”Eye problems are not on the UK’s list of coronavirus symptoms. At present, only a high temperature, new continuous cough, and loss of taste or smell are considered common signs of the disease.A spokesperson for Moorfields eye hospital, in London, said there was, at present, very little evidence to suggest Covid-19 could affect eyesight.“Cases where Covid-19 is recorded alongside an impact on eyesight are rare, so we cannot establish a direct causal effect,” the spokesperson said.Prof Chris Hammond, Frost chair of ophthalmology at King’s College London, who is also a consultant ophthalmologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS trust, said: “Eye problems with coronavirus, Covid-19, seem to be extremely uncommon and there aren’t any reports that I can find in the literature of anyone having visual loss due to the virus.“Maybe something like one in 100 people may get a bit of conjunctivitis, which can in theory blur vision. But it is pretty uncommon.” He added that such eye problems were more frequent among patients who had been ventilated.Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the eye, and typically has symptoms including pinkness of the eye, watering and a sticky discharge.Robert MacLaren, the professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, said reports from Wuhan suggested a link between Covid-19 and conjunctivitis, as well as conjunctival hyperemia (red eye), chemosis (eye swelling), epiphora (watery eye) and increased secretions (sticky eye). MacLaren noted such symptoms could affect vision.A spokesperson for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said the college was unable to report on an association of vision impairment with Covid-19 due to the lack of evidence. But, they added, the college had previous noted coronavirus might cause conjunctivitis.Hammond said it would be clear to an inidual if they had conjunctivitis. “You would be aware that you had a bit of a pink eye and it was a bit watery and discharging. A bit like a windscreen wiper on a car, you have to blink to clear the muck off the tear film.”Hammond said a report from Brazil suggested that, from scans, some Covid-19 patients appeared to have some damage to the retina, but the patients did not have any symptoms of eye problems or loss of vision.Hammond added that severe Covid-19 might mean patients needed their reading glasses more. “It is true when you have been significantly unwell, that as all your muscles are a bit weaker, the muscles that control the focus of your eyes can be weaker,” he said. But the situation, he noted, applied only to far-sighted people, adding that Cummings appeared to wear glasses for short-sightedness – myopia – being unable to see well in the distance.As for getting behind the wheel of the car to test your eyesight, Hammond said the Highway Code stated that drivers needed to be able to read a vehicle number plate at a minimum distance of 20 metres. “When you have your driving test to see if you are seeing well enough to be allowed to drive, they test whether you can read the number plate before they allow you in the car,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe6ef4dcbe791529b89a99cdc34e266f17a4e0e0/0_177_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ba9d4565edcbe19fa212197d8709886","title":"spacex nasa human space launch","story":"Elon Musk’s SpaceX, in partnership with Nasa, to launch Falcon 9 rocket from Florida carrying two American astronautsIn a historic moment a decade in the making, the skies above Florida will light up on Wednesday when the launch of a rocket born from a groundbreaking public-private partnership returns the United States to the business of human spaceflight.Not since the retirement of Nasa’s space shuttle fleet in 2011 has the US possessed the capability to send its own astronauts into orbit, and the success of this week’s mission, formally known as SpaceX Demo-2, is likely to shape the direction of the space agency’s near-Earth ambitions for a generation.At 4.33pm, a Dragon crew capsule attached to a Falcon 9 rocket is set to take flight from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, bound for the international space station (ISS). It will carry two Americans as test pilots, both veterans of previous space shuttle missions. They will remain there for up to three months while mission managers evaluate the spaceship’s performance.The hardware was built by SpaceX, the private California-based company founded by the controversial billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, and funded by the US government under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP).While every previous US space program was a government venture, Nasa signaled a switch of direction in 2010 with the initiative to subcontract low Earth orbit operations to private industry while concentrating its own efforts on longer-term goals, such as returning to the moon by 2024.In a symbolic nod to the new world order, the astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will ride to the launchpad in an electric car manufactured by Tesla, another of Musk’s pioneering companies, foregoing the “tin-can” Astrovan that has been the traditional crew transport since the US began sending humans into space in 1961.“We are on the cusp of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil yet again,” said Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, who referred to Wednesday’s planned launch as “the big show”.“This time we’re doing it differently than we’ve ever done it before. Nasa is not going to purchase, own and operate the hardware the way we used to. We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, drive down our costs and increase the access to space.”According to the Planetary Society, Nasa has invested $6.2bn in CCP since 2010, making it the lowest-cost human spaceflight development effort in almost 60 years. The money has been mostly split two ways, to SpaceX and its rival Boeing, whose uncrewed test flight of the Starliner human-rated capsule ended in partial failure in December, pushing back its next launch attempts to 2021.SpaceX, which has been ferrying cargo to the ISS since 2012 under a separate freight contract with Nasa, has had to overcome challenges of its own. A Crew Dragon capsule was destroyed in a ground test explosion at Cape Canaveral in April 2019, and in 2015, a Falcon rocket carrying supplies to the ISS exploded 139 seconds into flight.“Spaceflight is not easy. They’ve had hiccups along the way and they’ve overcome them,” said Dr Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.“They’ve done quite well. They’ve been in existence 20 years, so not quite your startup at this point. They have a younger, more energetic workforce along with hiring some very good, experienced people, most having cut their teeth on government programs, be it Nasa or defense programs.The cancellation of the workhorse shuttle program in 2011, after 30 years of flight and punctuated by two disasters that cost 14 astronauts their lives and lost the orbiters Challenger and Columbia, marked dark days for the space industry. More than 10,000 jobs were lost, and the economy around the Florida space center tanked, despite Nasa’s continuing robotic exploratory missions to Mars and beyond.With each astronaut’s seat on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS costing the US government up to $85m, some even feared for the future of Nasa itself. In recent years the industry has become resurgent, with entrepreneurs such as Musk Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, through his Blue Origin operations and Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson fuelling a building boom at Cape Canaveral and elsewhere.Blue Origin and Virgin are pursuing the space tourism market, while expanding ambitions in other directions: for example, a team including Blue Origin was selected in April to begin development of a lander capable of returning humans to the moon under Nasa’s Artemis program, while Virgin Orbit, a Branson offshoot, was planning the first test flight of its airborne rocket launch system LauncherOne this week.Donald Trump, who has made American spaceflight a policy priority through the foundation of the Space Force as the sixth branch of the US military, and an ambitious order to Nasa to make the first crewed moon landing since 1972 within the next four years, will attend Wednesday’s launch.Coronavirus, however, has led to Nasa urging the public to watch on television from home to avoid large crowds gathering on beaches and causeways near the space center. The agency has set up a website, Launch America, to enhance the experience.“This is a moment when we can all look and be inspired,” Bridenstine said. “We have a moment in time when we don’t just have to reflect on how difficult things are right now, we can talk about how bright things are going to be in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

It means rather than working on the frontline, she has to shield at home. “The guilt has been awful, with the feeling that I should be ‘doing my part’ and helping share the burden of my colleagues on the wards,” she says.Due to the nature of medical training, she moved to the area only last August and worries about asking for help with food supplies. “It feels like a big ask of new friends after their long shifts in sweat-drenched PPE to do a shop for me.”Jackson feels the government’s “stay alert” slogan is too vague and misinterpretation could be “catastrophic”. “If this was a hospital guideline, it would be sent back to the drawing board as unfit for purpose,” she says.“I live on my own and have been finding it difficult. Having no visitors – and no prospect of that – is hard,” agrees Alison Smith, 59, who has chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. “I feel like the older and high-risk amongst us are being sacrificed to get the economy going again but I actually feel more sorry for those being forced to work,” Smith says. “I used to commute on the London underground and the thought of having to do that now makes me shudder. I’m tired and also very, very angry.”For Susan Jenkins*, 58, who is shielding due to a chronic lung condition and is on oxygen 247, basic issues such as food are key. It took her weeks to get a government letter to say she was high risk but because of a lack of online food deliveries, her husband and teenage daughter are still having to brace the shops. “Each time they go out, they risk bringing back the virus and it will kill me,” she says.Jenkins is used to the risks of getting ill – her family wear surgical masks at home if they have just a cold – and is unimpressed by ministers. “I don’t really know what the government’s plan is. Neither do they,” she says. “The one measure the government could take is to start telling the truth and appoint someone as their spokesperson who can construct a sentence.”Others who are shielding are struggling with the financial impact. Jenny Pearhouse, 35, has severe asthma and is shielding alongside her husband, Chris, and two young daughters – who also have asthma – to keep safe.Chris works for a supermarket and – like many carers and high-risk workers – has been given leave from work but is not being paid. “We don’t have a rent holiday and still have to pay bills and food,” Jenny says. Government vulnerable food packages do not feed all four of them and they’re currently surviving on charity from churches and food banks. “I worry every day how we are going to manage.”Cheyne Moore, 38, is in lockdown in Cornwall with his wife and four-year-old son who has cystic fibrosis. Moore has had to close his small surfing school but his worries are focused on what being indoors is doing for his son’s health. “He swam every week, skateboards, went to the beach every day before the lockdown. Because of shielding we have not left the house or garden in the best part of eight weeks and all our fitness and health has suffered because of it.”Moore believes shielding will end up lasting longer than the original planned three months and says provision is going to be needed to support disabled people through it. “The ability to exercise and the mental need for space and fresh air has been deemed essential for the general population from day one, but what about the shielded?”In Bristol, Milner thinks the government should start to develop measures to help – such as mandating an hour in which only people who are shielding can go outside, which other countries are modelling. “It’s hard to see other people have more freedom, which effectively means the world will move on without us,” she says. “Boris Johnson didn’t mention us in his speech at all. It feels like I’m an afterthought.”Additional reporting by Paul Campbell*Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eaebc822f10a0a681eaf1164568d1d57c36ba4c/805_290_5749_3450/master/5749.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=969195ef69a53fccaf42543dcb7c24c3","title":"poverty debt young women self harm poorest backgrounds","story":"Report says those from poorest backgrounds five times more likely to harm themselvesYoung women are being driven to self-harm as a result of poverty, debt and their struggles to pay household bills, research shows.Women aged 16-34 from the poorest backgrounds are five times more likely to harm themselves than those from the most well-off families, according to the study by NatCen Social Research.Its findings, released by the charity Agenda, show a close association between wealth and mental ill-health, and show that young women in poverty are much more likely to suffer psychologically.Jemima Olchawski, Agenda’s chief executive, said NatCen’s research showed that the debate about the recent rise in mental health problems among young women – which often cites social media, exam stress and body image issues as negative influences – took too little account of deprivation.“It’s devastating to see such high and increasing levels of self-harm among young women, especially those living in poverty and facing deprivation. This is especially concerning as we move into an economic downtown,” Olchawski said.“The increase in self-harm among young women is deeply worrying. Yet the discussion around this issue and women and girls’ mental health is often very narrow, focusing on issues like social media rather than reflecting on wider causes. This research highlights the important relationship between self-harm and poverty.”Agenda is an alliance of groups working to help young women and girls affected by abuse, poverty, poor mental health, addiction, homelessness and criminal justice issues.NatCen, which based its findings on face-to-face interviews with more than 20,000 people in England, also found other stark differentials in mental health related to young women’s financial circumstances.Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s Budget Group, said: “This powerful report shows the strong links between poverty, mental health and self-harming for younger women. We know that young women are particularly likely to have been hit badly by the economic impact of Covid-19, since they are more likely to work in sectors like hospitality and retail that have been closed down.”Men, especially middle-aged men, are more likely to kill themselves than women. However, the suicide rate among girls and young women aged between 10 and 24 has risen: in 2018 it was the highest on record.Sally McManus, who led the research for NatCen, said: “People have become increasingly likely to report using non-suicidal self-harm as a way of coping and this increase is particularly apparent in young women. This report indicates that self-harm often occurs in the context of poverty and debt, especially for young women.”Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: “This survey underlines that economic and social inequalities have a major impact on our mental health. Young women’s mental health has deteriorated significantly in the last decade, and those who are most disadvantaged are at a far greater risk still.“The impact of Covid-19 on young women’s mental health is likely to add extra pressure both now and in the coming months and years. It’s vital that we take action now to protect mental health for all and reduce the inequalities that lie behind so much of the distress this survey has brought to light.”A government spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to supporting everyone’s mental wellbeing, especially during this unprecedented period. Vulnerable young women can continue to access mental health services, including virtually, and we have released new tailored guidance to help people deal with this outbreak through practical tips and advice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82e0dcd716897bf7e032ab6dbf1edf132f1cbbd8/346_31_2231_1339/master/2231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd246a7b57cdb79c515453821166620c","title":"ascot postpones shergar cup horse racing","story":"This year’s Shergar Cup, the competition involving jockeys representing regions of the world along with an international women’s team, has had to be cancelled. The Ascot event, scheduled for its usual early-August slot, was perhaps the race day most vulnerable to the coronavirus crisis, since it requires the presence of jockeys drawn from all around the world performing in front of a family-based crowd of up to 30,000.Nick Smith, Ascot’s director of racing, said: “Regrettably, given the complexities of flying jockeys around the world and uncertainty over what governmental regulations will be in place at the time, the Shergar Cup won’t take place this year.”Guy Henderson, Ascot’s chief executive, added: “We decided that this event, even if logistically possible, wouldn’t be the same without crowds and that the best option was to plan ahead to return with the event in 2021.” Ascot will work with the British Horseracing Authority to devise a replacement programme of races for the day.The event would have featured the return to Ascot of Emma-Jayne Wilson, the swaggering Canadian rider whose cheerful volubility made her a crowd favourite and a staple at the event for several years until her most recent appearance in 2017. Hayley Turner was also expected to take part, a year after finally winning the Silver Saddle for top rider at the meeting, which she described as “a massive thrill”.While Ascot hope to press ahead with the Royal meeting behind closed doors next month, the Shergar Cup would be much less likely to succeed in such a format, even if an appropriate collection of jockeys could be assembled. Its appeal is mainly to those present in the grandstands purist followers of the sport have not warmed to it in great numbers, while its programme of 10-runner handicaps featuring unfamiliar riders means it is of only limited appeal to punters.“I’m absolutely gutted,” Turner said. “I understand why it has to be this way but the Shergar Cup is always the highlight of the year for me. It’s good fun and it’s nice to get together with the international riders. But we can’t grumble, can we? There’s a lot worse things going on.”Meanwhile, Andrew Balding has enthused about the 2,000 Guineas prospects of Kameko, fourth in the betting for the Classic a week on Saturday. Balding sent his stable star, a Group One winner when last seen in November, to Kempton for a gallop last week and liked what he saw.As a caveat, the jockey expressed his admiration for the Guineas favourite, Pinatubo, whose unbeaten juvenile season made him the best two-year-old in Europe for 25 years. “I think he deserved his rating last year, he beat everything impressively. I thought the day at the Curragh was just incredible and the clock backed it up as well. So we have massive respect for him. You just hope one horse has improved more than the other from two years to three.”Balding added that soft ground would be a concern for Kameko but weeks of dry weather in Newmarket makes that seem a remote possibility for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/256ec21274030b7f759a9b7d0da8045152199e4d/476_92_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f236794a24351d376b962c989e44764","title":"my favourite game gerrard and torres humiliate manchester united","story":"They fell just short of winning a league title, but on a glorious afternoon at Old Trafford Rafael Benítez’s Liverpool thrashed one of the finest sides Alex Ferguson ever assembledIt is a measure of Liverpool’s recent progress that the closest shot at a Premier League title under Rafael Benítez doesn’t feel that close any more.I started supporting Liverpool as a child during the barren years of the 1990s, and while Gérard Houllier’s subsequent era was trophy-laden in comparison, the triumphs felt almost demure next to those of the country’s two best teams: Manchester United and Arsenal. While we celebrated, it felt like we were looked on with pity by our rivals, like our accomplishments would only make their footnotes.Enter Benítez in 2004, and everything changes. He won the Champions League in his first season. An FA Cup followed, so did another Champions League final. Finally we were being looked at with genuine admiration, even envy. It was the first time in my life a Liverpool team had the makings of champions, fuelled by the boundless naivety of being a teenager, and they reached their apotheosis in 2008-09. Pepe Reina was the reliable goalkeeper we’d been yearning for for a generation, Sami Hyypiä and Jamie Carragher were imperious, in midfield the brain of Xabi Alonso dovetailed with the brawn of Javier Mascherano. Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres had an almost telepathic connection up top.Benítez’s men arrived at Old Trafford on 14 March 2009 joint second but trailing Alex Ferguson’s side by seven points. We came into the game fresh from hammering Real Madrid 4-0 to face a legendary United team: Edwin van der Sar Nemanja Vidic Rio Ferdinand Ryan Giggs Carlos Tevez Wayne Rooney Cristiano Ronaldo. A team that had conceded just five goals in 13 home league matches. At a ground where Liverpool hadn’t tasted victory in almost five years (and hadn’t scored in the last three).A tentative opening quarter was brought to life when Reina felled Park Ji-sung. Ronaldo converted the penalty to deliver another ill omen for Benítez in six years after Ronaldo arrived in Manchester, United had never lost a home game in which he scored.Martin Skrtel sent a hopeful punt downfield that was horribly misjudged by Vidic. Torres was on to him in a flash, snatched the ball, and clipped it deftly over the legs of the oncoming Van der Sar. El Niño taunted United fans with a five-fingered celebration (a reference to our European Cup successes that was mimicked with delightful impertinence by Harry Wilson while on loan at Derby last season).With the game approaching half-time, Gerrard raced on to a ball from Torres, and was brought down inside the box by Patrice Evra. Up he stepped to plant the ball in to the net, and then a kiss on to the camera. 2-1. Delicious.United started the second half on fire, laying siege to our penalty area, and with just over 15 minutes remaining Ferguson rolled the dice with a triple substitution. But after 75 minutes it was game over. Vidic, already being given the runaround by Torres, hauled down Gerrard after being dispossessed and was shown a second yellow card (his second of four sending offs against Liverpool). The resulting free-kick was curled in with such breathtaking beauty by Fábio Aurélio even Van der Sar just stood there, admiring.Liverpool fans’ euphoria was soon to reach an even higher level. Another long ball caught out United’s defence and when Andrea Dossena, one of a long line of mediocre left-backs consigned to the at-least-he’s-not-Paul-Konchesky bracket, starts lobbing world class goalkeepers from outside the box you know you’re dealing with narratives of the ine.Benítez never won the Premier League, and Alonso’s departure that summer sparked a rapid curdling of his team, which finished seventh the following season. But on a gloriously sunny March afternoon, Liverpool stepped up and above their greatest rivals and humiliated them at their own gaff. And it was beautiful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee80b4e38712d180ff80fed2433e8287173af92c/0_458_3896_2336/master/3896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9e4eea3790f945982b15e2bcc8c401","title":"one giant leap meet the new generation of male royal ballet stars","story":"Beauty, strength and bags of energy: BBC Four’s Men at the Barre documentary gets up close and personal with the Royal Ballet dancers on the rise‘It’s a golden era of male ballet dancers.” So says Emma Cahusac, the commissioning editor behind a new documentary, Men at the Barre, part of BBC Four’s dance season. It’s not just hyperbole. The young men rising up at the Royal Ballet are some of the most exciting in dance right now: principals Matthew Ball and Marcelino Sambé, first soloists Cesar Corrales and William Bracewell, and first artist Joseph Sissens all feature in Men at the Barre. With the majority of them British or UK-trained, it’s a giant leap from the grumblings of a decade ago about the lack of local dancers making it to the top.I spoke to Ball, Corrales and Sambé by phone, all staying resolutely positive during this enforced break from their intensive dancing lives, but all desperate to get back to work with colleagues they’re certain are something special. “I see so much beauty and so much strength and power in that company,” says Sambé. “There has been a surge in this younger generation,” says Ball.Why this wealth of talent has arrived right now isn’t easy to pinpoint, but they definitely spur each other on. There’s healthy competition – ballet boys can’t resist a pirouette-off Corrales’ record is “at least 15” – but they all talk about how secure they feel because each dancer is very different.Liverpool-born Ball, 26, who trained at the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11, is the tall athlete-poet with a flair for drama. He took leave from the Royal Ballet to make a dazzlingly seductive turn in Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake and his interests lie in character and storytelling. “He’s almost dancing with his brain,” says Sambé. “There’s always something so intense going on he’s bubbling, bubbling, bubbling.”Ball and Sambé have been friends since the latter joined the Royal Ballet Upper School at 16. “Marcelino is so full of energy and vivacity and life,” says Ball. “That’s his personality and his dancing matches that. When you see him move it’s like a fish to water, it just makes sense.” Sambé’s joy as he springs and bounds has made him an outright audience favourite, although he admits his beaming smile was originally a mechanism for coping with nerves. “The one thing that made me feel comfortable was a big smile, to connect with the audience,” he says.Corrales, at 23, is the virtuoso prodigy. The son of Cuban ballet dancers, raised in Canada, he joined English National Ballet aged 17, was a principal at 20 and moved to the Royal two years ago. “He’s a real firecracker,” says Ball. “He certainly pushes us to achieve one more centimetre higher or an extra turn. People often talk about British dancers being controlled or mannered and that’s something I personally don’t want to buy into.”A notable line in Men at the Barre comes from ballet master Christopher Carr, who was a dancer in the Royal Ballet in the era of Rudolf Nureyev. He says that if Nureyev was around now, he wouldn’t be such a big star: “There are now better dancers.” Corrales takes issue with that. “Nureyev was on another planet!” he says. But it’s true that while Nureyev was ahead of his time, and had blazing power and charisma, there are technically better dancers with every generation. The expectations on young dancers now are much greater than their predecessors. Everything is bigger, faster, higher training draws on hi-tech sports science, and they must master not only the exactitudes of classical technique, but be versatile enough to perform the most contortive contemporary moves. They don’t just follow directions, either, but help develop movement with choreographers. “It’s very different to other generations,” says Corrales. “You need to have that skill of contributing, bringing ideas to the table.”With two ballet dancers for parents, Corrales had the genes and the set-up for a smooth career path. In Cuba dancers are revered, with footballer-like status, but growing up in Canada he experienced bullying, “especially since I was the smallest in the class,” he says. He could laugh, because “they just had no clue” about dance, but at the same time he thinks that spurred him on to literally jump higher. “All those negative comments, the bullying in school from a young age, gave me that power and explosiveness to become who I am today.”The teasing Corrales experienced probably chimes with most people’s expectations about the lingering stigma attached to boys who do ballet – mocking comments made by US television presenter Lara Spencer about Prince George doing ballet feature in Men at the Barre. But it’s not everyone’s experience. Ball, whose mother is a dance teacher, remembers “leaving school halfway through the day to go and audition in London and all the lads giving me high fives and wishing me good luck. I was actually quite supported, which some people might be surprised by, especially in Liverpool which is such a football city.”Unlike Ball and Corrales, Sambé doesn’t come from a dancing background. From a poor family in Lisbon, his construction-worker father died when he was eight and he was fostered by another family with a daughter at the Lisbon Conservatory, where Sambé studied. His earliest dance experience was in African dance and he first saw ballet on YouTube. He wouldn’t have found his calling without it, he says, especially seeing black dancers such as Carlos Acosta. “An incredible moment, thinking, yeah, of course you can do this.”The internet has inevitably had a huge impact on this generation of dancers, and on the reach of an art form previously confined to the stage. Having a social media profile is part of the job for dancers now, and the combination of gorgeous bodies and photogenic grit and strength has turned out to be catnip for brands looking for ambassadors and influencers. The dancers’ Instagram accounts reveal superhuman tricks and off-stage candour (Sambé has an account dedicated to his beautiful backstage shots of colleagues). You can check out how they’ve all been spending lockdown: Corrales and principal dancer girlfriend Francesca Hayward giddily laughing their way through multiple pirouettes Ball and his partner, fellow dancer Mayara Magri, filming their plyometric fitness routine in the park. When we speak, Ball has just taken delivery of a shoulder rig for his camera, using the time off to explore his other creative interests – he thinks there’s a lot of potential to better capture dance on film.Sambé has been painting and gardening, he tells me, and working on his own choreography, some of which can be seen in a film made (pre-lockdown) with Cloakroom magazine, all undulating muscles and sharp turns. It’s a hint of what’s to come, the choreography connecting to Sambé’s first experience in African dance, a meshing of dance identities he wants to pursue. “To be able to explore incredible ballet dancers’ bodies doing this kind of movement I think will be really cool.”Ballet can be so much more than its traditional image, insists Sambé, but it means this generation breaking out of the ballet bubble. “I believe the art form is still in its infancy,” he says, “and there’s so much more to explore. We need to look out at what is happening in the world, from politics to arts, and bring that into the ballet world.” More than ever, young dancers aren’t just empty vessels, he says. “There are so many layers to being an artist this way. The process is so rich and intense and visceral. The sacrifice brings such a specific grain and incredible strength. I feel there’s a misconception that we all just go on stage and look pretty, but no, there’s so much more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68899ccaa99451d4b4c876e6cd45724952cae551/0_148_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b92d79ff6cdfbc6f77d9072c25dfec9","title":"swan lake bath ballet bbc corey baker lockdown bathtub","story":"BBC commissions choreographer Corey Baker’s splashy new lockdown-friendly take on the classic balletIt has been performed by ballet companies in the grandest of opera houses around the world. Now a new take on Swan Lake, commissioned by the BBC, is to be performed in the confines of dancers’ own bathtubs.Swan Lake Bath Ballet, set to Tchaikovsky’s music, has been choreographed by Corey Baker who says the idea came to him, appropriately enough, in the shower. Baker wanted to create a piece uniting dancers who are in lockdown and he asked himself what they might all have in their home. “Everyone has a bath or a shower,” he said. “And I love choreography with water. We thought about recreating The Rite of Spring and then Swan Lake came to mind. I turned the music on and had a splash around.”Baker created the choreography in his own bathroom and made tutorial videos for a global lineup of dancers, some of who also improvised their own moves. Baker found that he had to direct and rehearse with the dancers from his toilet seat, so he could appreciate the confines they were performing within. When he tried to direct from his roomier kitchen, he would be moving around too much and asking them to execute moves that were impossible in their bathrooms.Each performer has been filming themselves on cameraphone, using an app from Filmic Pro that upgrades the quality of the footage. Baker is keen for the film to have a professional finish. Some dancers perform in coloured water one uses the feathery fillings of 20 pillows. “It’s a bit wild,” he says, laughing. “It’s been like hanging a picture blindfolded, a mile away.”Originally from New Zealand, Baker started out in ballet and joined the British company BalletBoyz before forming Corey Baker Dance. The company has often performed in unexpected locations, rather than theatres and opera houses, as Baker is keen to bring dance to new audiences. A lot of his work has concentrated on climate change, such as the dance film Spaghetti Junction, featuring dancers from Hong Kong Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet, which was released on Earth Day as part of Culture in Quarantine.Baker is grateful to have been busy with commissions, and draws attention to how many of his friends in dance and theatre have suffered during the coronavirus outbreak. One upside of the Covid-19 lockdown, he says, is that “the environment is going to benefit from a break and it will give climate scientists a chance to get real data that’s not speculative”. This current period, he suggests, allows “time for us all to think about what is essential, what we need to live and to make our society thrive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691d191445cb8abe6f83c6379549662a3d237e94/0_253_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cc414fd840d4ad9c65bfd1a50b7e528c","title":"what is it like to live on uk borders during lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from people who live on the border of two nations with different lockdown guidanceAfter Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refused to adopt the British government’s new “stay alert” slogan, instead opting to continue the original advice to “stay home”, the four nations’ approaches to coronavirus has begun to fracture.For those living on the UK’s borders, this ision has left them grappling with conflicting guidelines.

It’s both. The market town grew around the castle after its stone fortifications were built by Bernard de Balliol in the 12th century. The castle itself is a popular tourist destination.I guess it’s closed now, thanks to coronavirus. Yes, it is. Normally, there’s plenty to see in Barnard Castle, if your eyesight is up to it.Such as? There’s the Bowes Museum, which has an amazing silver swan automaton that preens itself.Is the museum open? Of course not. There’s a pandemic on, remember?So what would be the point of going to Barnard Castle? You can still have a lovely stroll through the town, or a dry cough by the river.And it’s only 30 minutes from Durham? That’s all – a quick day trip, as well as a great rehearsal for a longer journey to somewhere more exciting.I don’t think I should be making unnecessary car journeys just now. Yes, you carry on obeying the rules – they apply to you, after all.They apply to everyone, don’t they? It certainly can’t hurt for you to believe that.Sorry, but you’re being really confusing and contradictory. I know – I’m trying to reflect government policy in the wake of No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings’ admission that he drove from Durham to Barnard Castle after he was spotted there by members of the public.Why did he do that? He said he was testing to see if his eyesight was good enough to make it all the way to London.He drove 60 miles to check that he could see well enough to drive? Yes, but the good news is: he could! Should he not have gone to Specsavers? There’s a branch in the town, but there’s no evidence he dropped in. After his admission, TripAdvisor was deluged with spoof reviews for Barnard Castle, many purportedly from Cummings.What did they say? They’ve all been taken down now, because they “do not describe a firsthand experience”.At least non-firsthand reviews can’t be accused of violating either the letter or the spirit of the government’s pandemic restrictions.

Its star Dave Burd, AKA Lil Dicky, reveals where it all comes fromSo … does Burd, AKA Lil Dicky, really have two “pee holes” and a “dick made of balls”, as he says in the opening episodes of his sitcom Dave? “Everything about my penis in the show is true,” Burd affirms, saying that he was born with a tangled urethra and the condition hypospadias, where the opening to the urethra is on the underside of the end of the penis rather than the tip. “I wanted the show to be as real as possible and to be written from my own experience.”Dick jokes have been the cornerstone of Burd’s craft since he began his music career in 2013 with the release of the song Ex-Boyfriend (about meeting his ex’s boyfriend and standing next to him at a urinal: “This dude’s got a dick that I don’t comprehend  I had to move my neck to see it end to end”). Burd and his 10-part series Dave exist on the knife-edge of profundity, absurdity and hilarity. Co-written by Burd and produced by Seinfeld showrunner Jeff Schaffer, the show focuses on Burd as the eponymous Dave, a Jewish rapper trying to make it in the world of hip-hop as his alter ego Lil Dicky while negotiating his whiteness and litany of insecurities. It largely reflects Burd’s own experience – he quit his job as an advertising copywriter to become a rapper after Ex-Boyfriend hit 1m views in a day once he put it on YouTube.Throughout the show, the penis material underscores a continuing meditation on masculinity, especially in the face of the bravado promoted by Dave’s rap idols, such as Kanye West. We see Burd negotiate an intrinsic belief in himself and his greatness as a rapper with charges of cultural appropriation and the general disbelief of those around him. That meandering between arrogance and humility is reflected in reality too. “In record label meetings in real life, am I saying, ‘I’m Kanye but I’m white?’” Burd asks. “No. But I am saying, ‘I’m Kanye.’”Burd spent a year working on his rap material while working in advertising. “I’ve always believed for no particular reason that I was meant to be a star,” he says. “I always pictured myself being on screen but when I started telling people I wanted to be a rapper, they all thought I was insane. I was on vacation with my parents and my girlfriend in Hawaii just before I put anything online and they went around the table each saying why it would ruin my life.” When Burd’s videos went viral, he finally felt validated.“Imagine believing your whole life that you could be the greatest with nothing to base it on and everyone telling you it’s ridiculous, and then you get a million views in one day,” he says. “It was the best day of my life.” Initially releasing songs for their comedy value – “ridiculous tunes grasping for attention” – Burd soon realised his talent for verbal dexterity and his passion for rap was overtaking his satirical ambitions. “I stumbled into being a rapper,” he say. “I was the kind of guy who wouldn’t even do karaoke since I found it that hard to perform but now I’m so competitive I just want to be the best.”Yet, as a white rapper, Burd understands he exists as a privileged minority in hip-hop. It is an issue he tackles in the show as others question his use of a black hype man – who is also his real-life collaborator GaTa – and his description of some beats as “too urban”. “Cultural appropriation is when you’re stealing from something and not making it your own,” he says, “but when I rap, I try to be objectively unique in myself at all times. If there’s still an issue, then I don’t know what more I can do for you, since I am just explaining my own perspective via rap.”It is clearly a perspective that resonates, as Dave has become the most watched comedy show in its network FX’s history, beating rivals such as Donald Glover’s acclaimed Atlanta. The outcome is, of course, no surprise to Burd. “I’ve always believed that it was going to be a great show because the people who worked on it are too smart and the subject matter is too good,” he says. “I’m relieved because I’ve had one dream my whole life and I did it. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders.”But what about so many people now having an intimate understanding of his biggest insecurity: his penis? “I’m luckily just sitting in my house all day at the moment, so I’m not facing the reality that when I meet someone they might know about my dick,” he says. “And there’s even crazier stories for the next season, so who knows what things will be like when I go outside.”• Dave is on BBC Two on Sundays at 10pm and on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d0e5132c8ae2ae011d0f7a06558b6a834f878d/0_1695_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abd958ac3fe95e3de5c9ab1449a50f08","title":"succession made me glad i was born poor susan wokomas lockdown tv","story":"The star of Chewing Gum and Year of the Rabbit on bingeing HBO’s delectable yet disturbing hit, and the show she regrets watching in quarantineSusan Wokoma is in Netflix’s Enola Holmes and Amazon’s Truth Seekers, both released later this year"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13c5a3f4df4f10bdb6e7bd92f6506303c2c28f7/288_100_4682_2808/master/4682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be1610abf1cba0f59ae944aa2b04b3e3","title":"native americans coronavirus impact","story":"Coronavirus is novel to the world, but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experienceIn the first few weeks of 2020, as president Donald Trump dismissed and mocked warnings about a novel virus killing people faraway in China, Native American leaders were taking the deadly threat seriously.And they were right.The infection rate among the Navajo Nation has now surpassed the state of New York, the centre of the pandemic in the US, and on Monday stood at 2,680 cases per 100,000 people compared with 1,890 in New York.The data emerging from some smaller tribes is even worse. By mid-May, the known infection rate in the Pueblo of Zia, which has a population of 934 people, was 3,319 per 100,000 – ten times the rate of New Mexico where the tribe is situated, and almost double the rate of New Jersey – the second worst hit US state.The nearby Pueblo of San Felipe, population 3,544, is also badly affected with 3,301 known cases per 100,000. Reporting lags mean the actual infection rate for both tribes could be significantly higher.Coronavirus is novel to the world, but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experience. Native Americans feared the worst because they’ve been here before many times.“More than any other population in the country, the shared experience of surviving a pandemic is in our blood, it’s not historic, it’s current for American Indians, it’s our reality. We took it seriously because we had to,” said Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear, a social demographer at the University of Arizona and citizen of the Northern Cheyenne tribe in Montana.As a child, Rodriguez-Lonebear recalls being told by her grandfather not to play in certain spots where their relatives who died of smallpox and typhoid were buried.Now, it’s increasingly thought that the cruel conditions of colonization such as forced displacement, enslavement and starvation created the perfect conditions for deadly disease outbreaks, according to Jeffrey Olster, historian at the University of Oregon.“The impact of Indian removals like the Cherokee trail of tears forced people into horrific conditions of poverty and destitution. It wasn’t just because they weren’t immune, it was the conditions of colonization which made them vulnerable,” said Olster.This would also explain the lack of population rebound after each epidemic: the same horrific conditions caused low life expectancy and high infant and maternal mortality.Again, experts say that parallels can be drawn with what’s happening today as the coronavirus pandemic rages across the US.The disproportionately high Covid-19 infection rates in Indian Country are attributed to chronic structural and economic inequalities such as overcrowded housing, understaffed hospitals, lack of running water and limited internet access – resulting from the US government’s failure to comply with treaty obligations which agreed adequate funding for basic services in exchange for vast amounts of tribal land.“Back then, like today, tribes are trying to tackle a fatal virus without adequate resources. That’s a strong historic parallel, the simple failure of the federal and state governments to provide the resources necessary,” said Ostler.In addition, high rates of medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease have contributed to worse Covid-19 outcomes. For instance in Arizona, the death rate for indigenous people is 42.8 per 100,000 – almost six times higher than for white people. In Mississippi, they are dying from Covid-19 at 10 times the rate of whites, according to analysis published last week by APM Research Lab.Native communities, who rely on their elders for oral history and traditions, are also concerned about the survival of their ancient cultures.“We are survivors of genocide, our numbers prove it… for nations with less than a thousand citizens, losing one person is too many,” said Rodriguez-Lonebear. “And losing even one of our elders threatens the future of our tribal nations as it means losing our language, oral histories and the cornerstones of our families and communities.”In fact, the situation is likely worse as the data currently available is extremely patchy.In New York, where significant ethnic disparities have emerged, no data is being collected on indigenous peoples. “This oversight is especially hammering… it’s a painful blindspot in New York,” said Andi Egbert, senior demographer at APMResearch.Native peoples with Covid-19 are being “eliminated from the data” because their ethnicity is so frequently misclassified or ignored, according to Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the national tribal epidemiology centre based in Seattle.“Without the data, we’re going to keep dying and nobody is going to acknowledge that… and resources allocated by congress won’t reach the communities,” said Echo-Hawk.Over recent weeks, Trump and his supporters have pushed for America to reopen for business, even though scientists are still months from finding a vaccine or treatment.Yet native communities have demonstrated a greater historical awareness of the experience of pandemics, and tried to protect their citizens through measured emergency responses with limited resources, but which assert their right to self determination and governance.“Indigenous nations have been through so many waves of pandemics and epidemics that they have a well of resilience, stamina and intergenerational knowledge that others just do not have,” said Jessica Kolopenuk, a political theorist and indigenous studies scholar at the University of Alberta. “I am of the strong opinion that indigenous knowledge and world views can really help change the course of this pandemic.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? The infection might have been traced to animal carcasses piled in a seafood market’s lanes, and after they were destroyed – and experts issued their usual warnings that a more serious outbreak was inevitable – the coronavirus story might have ended.What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments.In the middle of the night in Baghdad, on 3 January, a US drone fired the most consequential shot in the Middle East in a generation, killing 10 people including Qassem Suleimani, leader of the expeditionary force of Iran’s Revolution Guards.The 62-year-old general had been a thorn in the side of the American-led occupation of Iraq, overseeing the Islamic republic’s campaign in Syria and nurturing proxies that turned Iran into a regional player. He was thought to be untouchable. Donald Trump marked his killing with a wordless tweet of a grainy American flag.The chaotic days following the killing involved a deadly crush at one of the general’s public funerals, Iran’s first ever missile strikes on US troops, the accidental shooting down of a passenger jet over Tehran – killing all 176 aboard – and an outburst of anti-regime protests in Iranian cities.The reverberations may be felt for years: nearly all the regional projects Suleimani was overseeing when he died have faltered, the Observer reported this month, and the al-Quds force is struggling to manage its network of proxies without his giant presence.The largest swarms of locusts in decades have descended on farms in parts of Africa, south Asia and the Arabian peninsula this year, posing “an extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods”, according to the UN.The pests form vast, destructive clouds that can travel about 55 miles (90km) in 24 hours. A swarm about a square kilometre large can consume the same quantity of food in a day as 35,000 people. The risk of second waves is said to still be critical, including in Yemen, where food security is already dire amid the ongoing civil war.Hostility towards Indian Muslims has crept further into the Indian mainstream in the past five years since the country’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected. In February, it boiled over during a state visit by Donald Trump, culminating in the country’s worst religious violence in decades.The catalyst was widely acknowledged to be a ruling party leader, Kapil Mishra, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum that if the police did not clear the streets of mostly Muslim protesters, his supporters would be “forced to hit the streets”.At least 50 were killed in the ensuing violence between Hindu and Muslim mobs, amid allegations that the Delhi police stood back to allow Hindus to commit violence while beating to death some of the Muslim men in their custody.The riots and killings contributed to growing unease about the kind of India that may emerge from Modi’s years in power.After nearly 19 years, more than 43,000 civilian casualties and three US presidents, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban on a Saturday afternoon in late February.It was a good deal for the Taliban: they managed to exclude elected officials in Kabul and deal with the Americans directly. On paper, US troops could be gone from the country by spring 2021. The Taliban have promised to sit down with their Afghan government counterparts and make a separate peace deal later, but there is no guarantee they will do so, and their attacks on the Afghan army and police continue.The US says the ongoing violence means their troops may stay, but it is clear, not least to the Taliban, that Washington is desperate to get out of the war.For a few days after Bernie Sanders swept the Las Vegas Democratic primary, it appeared that a self-described “democratic socialist” was going to win the nomination of a major American party. Instead, the Democratic establishment rallied behind former vice-president Joe Biden, the campaign’s standard-bearer for the liberalism of the Obama and Clinton eras.Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday and soon after clinched the nomination, but there was no victory tour, nor conciliatory rallies with his opponents. Instead, the 77-year-old appeared to vanish from view as the scale of the coronavirus emergency finally broke through to policymakers and the public. He is currently campaigning from the basement of his Delaware home.On 6 February, an Argentine weather station on Antarctica’s northern tip recorded a temperature of 18.4C (65.1F) – roughly the same as Los Angeles that day, Nasa noted. The freak temperatures were attributed to the confluence of warmer than average sea surfaces, a high pressure system over South America and a warming phenomenon known as the foehn effect.They come against a backdrop of another looming crisis: an almost 3C temperature increase on the Antarctic peninsula over the past 50 years, part of a pattern of unusual weather events associated with global heating, including Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season.Campaigners in April hailed the passage of a new law that makes the practice punishable by up to three years in prison, but were sober about its impact. The practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture and will take time to be eradicated entirely. “There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,” Fatma Naib, a Unicef communication officer in Sudan, told the .A dawn raid in a Paris suburb in May snared one of the world’s most wanted men. Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy Rwandan businessman, is accused of creating and funding the notorious Interahamwe militia that carried out the 1994 killings of about 800,000 people in less than three months.His radio station, the Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, allegedly helped lay the groundwork for the genocide with its relentless dehumanisation of the Tutsi population. “You have missed some of the enemies,” it said in one notorious broadcast during the killings. “You must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full.”A 2003 attempt to capture Kabuga in Nairobi ended with the mysterious death of the man who was supposed to give up his location. French police said the 84-year-old had also spent time in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.He is yet to enter a plea in a French or international court, but his lawyers said last week that he had the right to be presumed innocent.The fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African American, as he jogged in a coastal city in the US state of Georgia in February, initially received little national attention. The two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in self-defence. Police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case.That changed with the 5 May release of a video depicting Arbery’s last moments. The man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street. He reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear. A struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off. The last scene shows Arbery dying in the street.The shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting, and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities, and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths.Once a fringe notion espoused by Israel’s far right, the idea the Jewish state would simply declare swaths of the Palestinian territories – where its settlements have been proliferating for decades – its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream.The Trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with Palestinian leaders, but it is unclear what conditions – if any – the White House would impose on the Netanyahu-Gantz government. The annexation was “an Israeli decision”, Mike Pompeo said recently.European leaders, the UN and scores of retired Israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan, arguing that it would isolate Israel and pour petrol on the volatile region. It would also signal the death of the two-state solution, the 1994 outline for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations, but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99978e01289d465b6fda28dace6e07ec14db7de9/0_0_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dba469e916a187150abe25598025f4f0","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance ","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,508,904. The death toll stands at 346,612. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK has topped 47,000, according to the latest available data. The total includes new figures published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics covering England and Wales, which combined with information published last week by the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that so far 47,343 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.The controversial French doctor Didier Raoult has dismissed a study suggesting the drug he hails as a miracle treatment for coronavirus is ineffective at best and possibly life-threatening at worst. The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. But Raoult dismissed the concerns: “Nothing will change what I have seen with my own eyes,” he said. “I’ve no idea if elsewhere, hydroxychloroquine kills, but here it’s saving people.”A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in Yemen, a country ravaged by five years of war that finds itself uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was seeing a “growing number of families resorting to harmful coping mechanism” such as begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A UNHCR spokesman, Charlie Yaxley, said: “We are reaching a potential breaking point in our programmes where if we don’t receive further funding soon, many of our programmes and particularly our cash assistance programmes to internally displaced Yemenis may have to stop.”Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, from 21 June. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted from 31 May, while a phased lifting of curfews will begin this week.Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342.Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an “immediate second peak” if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: “We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down.”The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has said he will not allow students to go back to school until a vaccine is available. Children were due to return to school at the end of August after classes for more than 25 million primary and secondary students were shut down in March. But Duterte said he believed the risk was too great, even if it held students back academically. “Unless I am sure that they are really safe it’s useless to be talking about opening of classes,” the president said. “For me, vaccine first.”The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.Australia will not open the country’s borders “anytime soon”, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. “I was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we’ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,” Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.Children under the age of two should not wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d7dcede8bab1705891c6686a5d4e8ae8788b31/547_966_5537_3322/master/5537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f02167906c3cadaf7e55de934bc04df6","title":"how a haredi community in london is coping with coronavirus photo essay","story":"Photographer Grey Hutton has been documenting the Haredi Orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill as the lockdown has disrupted ways of lifeEli Sufrin was admitted to University College hospital with Covid-19 just before Passover. He was rushed there by the Jewish volunteer ambulance service, Hatzola, after they had called at his house to check up on him. While he was in hospital, another volunteer organisation took care of Eli’s family’s shopping for Passover as they were self-isolating. Twice, a local restaurant cooked and delivered supper for the family, and when Eli’s wife wanted to send him kosher food to eat and books to read, Lecheiris, a local volunteer group, took the package to the hospital for her.Across the UK, communities have hastily pulled together in the pandemic, with leaflets posted through doors, WhatsApp groups set up and crowdfunders launched. Many people are meeting neighbours for the first time. In Stamford Hill, north London, the networks of support are well established. “Not on my fingers and toes could I count the times I’ve been helped by community organisations recently,” Sufrin said as we chatted on the street during the Jewish holiday of Lag B’Omer.Many strictly Orthodox Jewish families in the Stamford Hill community do not have access to social media and mainstream news outlets, so some were slow to grasp the severity of the situation. “Close-knit means we’re all there for each other and we keep in daily contact. But it also means we tend to congregate more, and the virus has spread much quicker,” said Mrs Davidovits, a part-time teacher and volunteer at the Interlink Foundation.Haredi men pray at least three times daily in the synagogue, and some spend six or seven hours there. So when Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, ordered the closure of all United Synagogues, the largest network of Orthodox synagogues in the country, in the same week that schools across the UK were told to close indefinitely, the community was shaken.Sam Friedman, a local graphic designer saw what was going on and started a physical distancing awareness campaign putting notices in local magazines and on social media. He said: “For some people essential things means going to the supermarket, but for some essential means what’s ideally required by the Jewish law, and that is prayer in groups. Many people have never prayed by themselves in the house setting, with kids around. It’s very tough. These people needed an extra dose of awareness to adhere to the law.”Yoni Koppel works in property maintenance, and for the last three years he has volunteered with Chaveirim in his spare time. Chaveirim offers a free 247 service to help with breakdowns, gas leaks and other odd jobs around the area, but when I met him in April we drove to Homerton and Royal London hospital to drop off food and drink packages to the NHS staff there. Covid-19 has forced many organisations in Stamford Hill to adapt to the needs of the community. “At first my wife was worried,” Yoni said. “But we have been brought up in the same area, and here if people need help you have to put yourself in the frontline. So she does understand.”It’s not only men volunteering to criss-cross town dropping off packages and offering support. But when I reached out to some of the women, they politely declined to talk about it. Mrs Davidovits told me some Haredi women were leading organisations in Stamford Hill, but they did not want to attract attention due to tzniyut, a Hebrew word that best translates as modesty. “It’s not only about the way we dress, but it’s behaviour as well and about putting ourselves out there. It’s very central to our way of life, for men and women.”The virus has shone a light on cracks in every community, but it has also unearthed resilience. The close-knit way of life in Stamford Hill meant lockdown presented previously unimaginable challenges and many were at risk. Everybody knows people who have died. Equally, those like Eli who needed support in a moment of need have undoubtedly received it.

But what do we know about how the system works and if it will be ready by next week?What is contact tracing – is is just about a new phone app?No. The NHS app being trialled on the Isle of Wight is a very useful addition to contact tracing, but no replacement for human beings who will get in touch with people who may have been in contact with those who have coronavirus symptoms.Is the contact tracing system ready to go?Not yet. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said 25,000 telephone contact tracers had been recruited – more than the 18,000 he set as a target – although we do not know whether they have all been trained and are ready to start work. However, the much-discussed NHS app that is supposed to alert people who have been close to somebody who has Covid-19, has been delayed and will not be ready until 1 June. Last Thursday, Prof John Newton, of Public Health England, told the Downing Street briefing there were advantages to starting one part of the operation ahead of the other.How important is the app?The government initially set great store by it. Hancock is known to be a great fan of technology. It was hoped it would make the work of contact tracing much easier, but the trial on the Isle of Wight has thrown up problems. For one thing, it appears the app does not work so well with Google- and Apple-operated phones.What will the call handlers do?They will work from home initially, and possibly in call centres later. They will be given the details of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 and call them to find out whom they have met in the previous two days. The call handlers will phone those people and advise them and their family to self-isolate for 14 days. They should then check on them regularly to ask how they are and whether they are coping. If any of those contacts becomes ill, the call handlers will ask them in turn for the names and numbers of people they have been with.Will people who get a call and are told to self-isolate cooperate?Some will and some may not. A pilot project run by a group of doctors in Sheffield found a number of problems, including a reluctance by some people to self-isolate when it meant being unable to earn money. Several of those people were working in care homes.Many public health doctors think the tracing schemes should be run at local authority level, by people who are part of the community and will be better able to find and support people, rather than call handlers who may be located in a different part of the country. Contact tracing in the past has been done by local environmental and public health officers.Will Dominic Cummings’ decision to travel 264 miles to Durham to self-isolate make it more difficult for call handlers to persuade people to stay at home?That is the fear of some behavioural scientists. Some families may think if he can interpret the rules how he likes, then so can they."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253487.1589465788!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cao decision time what should you study at college","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSelecting a college course requires a considerable  level of planning and commitment. Too many students end up dropping out of courses for which they are unsuitable.With all the uncertainty that Leaving Cert students have been living with over the past three months it is only now that they can turn their minds to the final list of CAO course choices, which they will have to submit to the CAO by 5.15 pm on 1st July next. Securing a degree at the end of three or four years of study will be a major achievement, but you’ll only manage it if you’re determined and focused on its course content from day one.Unfortunately, thousands of current Leaving Cert students have applied to the CAO to go to a college purely because their friends plan to attend, while others will have applied for courses without conducting any detailed research.Many of these students will drop out of their courses before Christmas 2020, once the reality of what’s involved in completing the programme dawns on them.Would you start a marathon on a whim? Absolutely not: such a task requires months of training and planning. Selecting a college course requires the same level of planning and commitment.If you think you might be one of these people, you have just over a month to rectify the situation. By now you are no doubt aware of the course options available to you depending on how you perform in the forthcoming grade assessments, undertaken by your teachers. If not, Qualifax has details of every course on offer, and its advanced search facility will enable you to refine your search to those subjects that genuinely interest you.The litmus test is what will motivate you to get out of bed on a cold morning next winter, when nobody will be checking whether you do so or not, to attend lectures, study the topics in the library, write the assignments that such research will generate, and then pass your first-year exams next May. All of the above is of course contingent on how colleges organise the delivery of their programmes in a post covid19 world. At this stage choosing a course should have very little to do with what job you will get when you leave college in three to four years’ time.Ensure you select a suitable courseIf you think you will not have enough CAO points, following your teachers assessment of your performance over the past two years, to get on to your preferred course at your preferred college, look at other options farther afield, where smaller college-age populations result in lower point requirements.You should also research local further education (FE) Post Leaving Certificate options, which may have reserved places on your preferred course, meaning you could secure a place on the programme in September 2021.Even if you are perfectly happy with your original course choices, it is wise to review them. Courses are discontinued all the time, and colleges often add new courses to the CAO system. Dozens of courses on offer in May 2020 did not exist when the CAO printed its handbook last summer. Explore them now.Between now and July 1st, log on to your account on cao.ie and see what courses you have listed, and in what order. For the courses you have listed, study the full content of each year’s lectures and how they might allow you to progress to employment or postgraduate opportunities, on qualifax.ie. Where will a degree in the subject you select now lead to? Technological change is rapidly reshaping the nature of work, and a degree completed in 2025 or 2026 could well open opportunities in the labour market that have not yet been envisaged. So, don’t worry about it now just get your course choices right over the next few weeks. What happens if I make that mistake?If you end up in August when the colleges offer their places, accepting a course that is not right for you, be it because you do not like the curriculum, you did not research the content thoroughly or you realise that you have selected a course you have no interest in, you may end up dropping out during the academic year or failing the exams.If either of these happens and you decide to return to college the following year to study another course, you will have to pay another registration fee of €3,000 in 2021. You will also have to fork out the course fee of at least €5,000 that the Department of Education will pay the college on your behalf this year.The Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the State, will pay course fees only once for each year of an approved course. If you end up repeating a year, you (or more likely your parents) will be the one paying. This extra €5,000 would bring your total fee for your first year to at least €8,000. This is far beyond the means of many families, especially when you factor in the living costs of attending college.Even if you choose a course at a private college this year, then leave it to follow one in a State-funded college next year, you still must pay the full fees. Fees paid to private colleges are tax deductible at 20 per cent on any charges over €3,000, and so are treated in the same way as State-funded places, even if you do not claim the tax relief.Things to checkMake sure you meet all the entry requirements and have taken the required subjects at the appropriate level. (An example of this is the higher-level maths requirement for level 8 engineering degrees.) With this list in hand, put them in an order of preference or priority.The coming month will be one of the most intensive periods of engagement between colleges and prospective students. Colleges will facilitate inidual interactions with staff, via online communications or virtual open days. You can use these forums to discuss any programme you are seriously considering. Contact the course director or programme office. You will find phone numbers and email addresses in the college prospectus or on the college website. When you have completed this process list your final course choices on your CAO record in the order you want them, allowing for all possible outcomes from your assessed grades.You have up to 10 choices at both level 8 higher degrees and level 7 and 6 ordinary degrees and higher-certificate programmes. Never disregard the level 7 and 6 courses out of academic snobbery: almost all these programmes allow you to progress to the level 8 higher degree with an additional year of study.Do not finalise your choices without consulting the key adults in your life, such as your parents and guidance counsellor. Although you can no longer communicate with your teachers, your Guidance Counsellor will continue to communicate with you online to help you finalise your course choices. Make sure to use their expertise before you finally submit your course lists.

How do I apply to receive my calculated grades? All Leaving Cert and Leaving Cert Applied students are required to register on gov.ieleavingcertificate by 10pm on Thursday May 28th. Students - where relevant - are also required to confirm the level at which they intended to sit each of their subjects. Cabdidates will have the option of confirming the level or changing to a lower level. When registering on the website, students must have the following information to hand: (1) Your examination number (2) Personal Public Service number (PPS), which you will use to create a four-digit PIN code (3) Email address (4) and mobile phone number.Once the Department of Education has received all the necessary data from schools, students will be asked to opt in through the portal to indicate if they wish to receive calculated gradesHow, simply, will the calculated grades process work?There are two stages to the process.First, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank in their class. These estimates will be based on coursework and in-school assessments over the last two or three years. Secondly, the department will apply a national “standardisation” to the grades. This could result in the adjustment of grades up or down based on a number of data sources.These sources include a school’s achievement in a particular subject over recent years and the proportional distribution of grades nationally, sometimes referred to as a bell-curve.What will happen in the case of a teacher who is due to grade their son or daughter?Teachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.Are there any rules to prevent students or parents lobbying teachers on their grades?Any attempt to inappropriately interfere with the grading process may be recorded by a school and forwarded to the department. In addition, the department has stated that teachers and schools must not be subjected to “any type of influence, inducement (including gifts), pressure or coercion by a parent, student or any other person in relation to a student’s mark or ranking either before or after it has been assigned”.Such contact would be regarded as “totally inappropriate” and a “serious attempt to interfere with the fairness and objectivity” required of teachers and schools in the assigning mark for the students in the school as a whole. I performed terribly in my mocks. What exams or assessments, exactly, will teachers base their judgements on when calculated grades on?The guidance will state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions. As a result, an inidual mock exam should not distort a student’s achievement.What happens with the 100 per cent mark I was due to receive for the cancelled oral exams?The department says these marks are no longer valid and all subjects will be assessed using the calculated grades model. Teachers will be asked to consider what they feel the student would have achieved in the oral exam, based on past performance, as part of the process for awarding calculated grades.What will happen with Leaving Cert candidates who have been studying for subjects outside their schools?In cases where students are studying a subject outside school with a tutor or teacher, this shouldn’t be a problem. Schools will be required to engage with the tutor or teacher (it doesn’t have to be a registered teacher) outside the school when determining a student’s estimated grade. Problems may arise in cases where a student is studying a subject outside school and does not have a tutor. Similarly, there may be issues for an “external candidate” (such as adult learners, home-schooled students or those in alternative or private college that are not officially State-recognised) who does not have a teacher or tutor.A total of 2,858 external candidates are entered to sit the Leaving Cert this year, though it’s hard to say how many do not have a tutor or teacher.Put simply, the calculated grades process is primarily school-based and requires teachers to be able to make an informed estimate of a student’s likely grade based on their work to date. If this evidence is not available, a school principal will not be able to stand over the grade.The department says it will examine all cases on a “case by case” basis, but has acknowledged that some may not be able to receive a calculated grade and will need to wait to sit the written Leaving Cert exams.What happens if a student in a school is taking an extra subject outside the school, such as Polish?A school will be asked to include that tutor’s estimate of a candidate’s mark if the school is satisfied it can stand over the estimate. The student’s performance in that subject will then be amalgamated with the school grades. However, if the school is not satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available to them to stand over any estimated mark, it is required to inform the department. In this case, the student may not receive an estimated result for this subjectMy school is new and has never had a Leaving Cert class before. Will our grades be assessed differently?It is expected that these schools will be advised to work with whatever historical data is available for students during the senior cycle, in the same way as any other school.Will international colleges recognise my calculated grades?Students will receive a State-issued certificate and it is understood that these will be recognised in the UK and EU. Other countries, such as the UK, are also awarding calculated or predicted grades, which in turn will be recognised by Irish third level institutions.When will results be issued?There is no official date yet, but Minister for Education Joe McHugh has signalled that the provisional results will issue as close to the usual time in mid-August as possible.Will I be able to appeal my grades?Yes, but the appeals process will be limited to checking data entry errors rather than reviewing a teacher’s professional judgement.Students will also be entitled to submit a request for their mark and school ranking under data protection legislation. Those who are still unhappy will have the option to sit the deferred Leaving Cert written exams whenever they are held, which will be in line with public health advice. However, it will be too late to start college in the coming academic year based on these exam results Leaving Cert results.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258268.1589994578!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"third level gears up for blended learning","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents will have to familiarise themselves with using the virtual learning environment  this year  due to  the increasing emphasis on  social distancing caused by the Covid-19 virus.As prospective students finalise their CAO choices and social restrictions introduced to disrupt the coronavirus pandemic are eased, what should this year’s crop of first year undergraduates expect when they start college in September?The first thing worth noting is that the third-level landscape is going to look very different when compared to previous years as the sector has undergone profound change in the space of just a few months.The arrival of the coronavirus on Irish shores triggered an abrupt move away from the traditional face-to-face style of teaching that most Irish students were familiar with.Almost all teaching activity had to be rapidly migrated to online teaching platforms as lectures were cancelled, campuses were evacuated, and many examinations were called-off or postponed.While some restrictions have eased in recent weeks, the expectation is that we are facing into a period of prolonged social distancing and by implication, continued disruption to the traditional university model.In a sector where you could have up to 500 students attending a single lecture, social distancing restrictions will directly impact how these courses are delivered at our third level institutions.In many colleges, lectures will be delivered online and students will attend campus in smaller groups for face-to-face sessions, tutorials and lab work. This combination of online learning and traditional classroom-based elements is referred to as blended learning.Students should check course specifications with the institution in question to see how their preferred course may be affected.The majority of third level institutions already had systems in place to facilitate remote working and distance learning before the arrival of Covid-19. These systems, sometimes referred to as virtual learning environments, are now expected to feature more prominently in the coming years as critical tools for the delivery of tertiary education.Video conferencing tools, online quizzes and specialised simulations might be more reflective of the global digital age than of traditional teaching methods but when used properly they can be effective tools for teaching and learning.Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Dr Alison Hood, Dean of Teaching and Learning at Maynooth University says online course delivery gives students the flexibility to work at their own pace.Learning through technology can also help students “develop the digital literacies necessary for their future careers.”The use of technology can enable new opportunities for groupwork and collaborative learning and according to Dr Hood, can generate new opportunities for conducting assessment and providing feedback.“If utilised well, technology can improve access and support more inclusive participation for students with disabilities,” she says.One strategy that has emerged as a feature of distance learning is ’classroom flipping’. This is an approach to blended learning that is focused on enhancing engagement within the classroom setting. Whereas in the past students would attend lectures, take notes and then perhaps then prepare homework or assignments, flipping means the lectures are watched remotely and the work is prepared in advance while the ’live’ session is spent analysing the work in the presence of the instructor.To facilitate the new dispensation, students in many cases can expect college to start earlier than usual this year in order to facilitate special orientation sessions designed to help them adapt to the new learning environment.At DCU for example it is expected that first-year students will begin two weeks earlier than usual. However, as elsewhere, the health of students and staff will be prioritised as the virus is likely to impact how courses are delivered on an ongoing basis.Protecting the health and wellbeing of students and staff “is paramount and overrides everything else,” says DCU President, Professor Brian MacCraith.He says the approach taken at the university enables flexibility and the ability to “adapt to any change in circumstances.”“We will leverage DCU’s experience and capabilities in online and blended learning to offer every student a safe and high quality learning experience. If any student cannot access campus because of their specific healthcare situation, we will provide the highest standard of remote delivery to overcome these issues.”Most colleges will have additional supports in place to help guide students . As the focus continues to shift to blended and online learning, more resources are likely to be allocated to help improve outcomes.The National Institute for Digital Learning at DCU is developing a free ‘Learning how to learn online’ course for students at the start of the next academic year.The course will support students as they adapt a greater focus on learning online in higher education settings. Insights gained from the course will help harness the potential of online education and provide improved online learning experiences for students.The increased use of blended education is likely to have some unforeseen consequences for the education sector and those within it.There is a danger that the digital ide could increasingly prove to be a barrier to access as technology is increasingly integrated into the learning experience.To overcome this barrier to learning students will not only need high quality internet access and the technical tools required to do so but colleges and universities will need to ensure the requisite supports are in place to address the social equity imbalance.Nuala McGuinn, who is Director at the Centre for Adult Learning \u0026amp Professional Development at NUI Galway says when it comes to the development of online content best practice should include an “awareness that there will be differences in terms of access to the internet and digital resources so flexibility in learning will have to be featured into course design.”It is also important to build in support for remote learners. “Make sure to build in opportunities for pastoral support of students or some “online coffee-like threads” to check in and see how students are coping with the online environment”, she says.Another unforeseen consequence of the pivot to blended learning is the impact it could have on the student rental market.The wider rental sector was one of the first to be impacted by the pandemic. Within days of the shutdown, property websites recorded a surge in rental properties coming onto the market as demand for short-term lettings collapsed.It was reported earlier this month that the number of homes available to rent across the State has jumped by nearly 40 per cent as a result of the crisis.From a practical point of view students whose presence is no longer required on a full-time basis in college should justifiably ask whether it is worth their while renting accommodation for the year or if other arrangements such as commuting to college on the days they have to be present might be a better option.Social distancing rules will invariably limit the degree to which colleges can ask students to be present on campus. However, blended learning could offer greater access to third level education and as colleges work out how they can rotate students in and out of campus there could be an opportunity to open programmes up to more people than would typically register for a traditional course.There is no doubt but students and colleges are facing into an uncertain year. No-one knows how long the restrictions will last.Some colleges are already making preparations to rebalance back towards face-to-face learning in the event of the virus being fully eradicated.But, so as not to be caught off-guard, they are also preparing to react swiftly to any reintroduction of government restrictions.Students will have to familiarise themselves with using the virtual learning environment to a greater degree this year than they had to in the past. There will be challenges for some disciplines, as students of fine arts might attest, but there will also be new and innovative ways of tackling problems.Flexibility is therefore likely to be a key feature of college life in 2020.“Now is a period of great uncertainty and our university community will undoubtedly be presented with challenges,” says Professor Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh President, NUI Galway.“Recommencing teaching in the autumn will require creative thinking and flexibility to adapt to the continuing restrictions and disruptions to normal life.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Rite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong timeNetwork could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issues"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Students who left the State before completion of their studies due to Covid-19 may return and resume their studies, according to new measures introduced by the Department of Justice.Under current guidelines English language students from outside the EU can study for a maximum of two years in Ireland on a visa which allows them to work in casual employment for a maximum of 20 hours per week during school term and 40 hours per week during holidays.Language students, whose visas were due to expire between May 20th and July 20th, have had their visas extended by two months. It allows them to remain and work part-time in Ireland provided they re-enrol in an online course of study. An estimated 1,000 foreign language students have been left thousands of euro out of pocket following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, with many living in overcrowded settings and with no means of securing an income because of the closure of so many pubs, restaurants and shops. Many language schools offered credits rather than refunds to students. Many of those students who have left will not be able to return to Ireland.

Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

The sector required a specific plan. We knew that Covid-19 disproportionately impacts on older people. The planning and focus was almost exclusively on our acute hospitals. Multiple clusters initially emerged in our hospitals. But the numbers in nursing homes started to increase.”Mr Daly is expected to tell the committee that in the absence of a national strategy and response for the nursing home sector, a number of challenges emerged. These included insufficient testing of residents and staff, mass shortfall of PPE and aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE as well as discharges from acute hospitals to nursing homes without testing.According to his opening statement, Mr Daly says the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the authority responsible for the commissioning of nursing home care, “fell silent as homes incurred considerable and responsible costs to manage the pandemic. The Department of Health eventually intervened.”“Key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days. The dismay will live forever with us.”The committee will also hear from representatives of the Sage advocacy group for vulnerable adults and older people.According to an opening statement for the group, the initial warning signs regarding a Covid-19 pandemic were generally recognised by private nursing homes.“However, because of the lack of effective working relationships with the HSE, and the focus at state level on an expected surge and resultant threat to the acute system, the dangers to the most vulnerable who were in nursing homes did not become centre stage until the systemic weaknesses of the outsourced system became clear.”The group says that “the development of such a significant ‘blind spot’ at statutory level is something that requires considerable reflection.”The advocacy group will also say that in the absence of a robust testing system it is “most likely that there would have been some transfers of Covid-19 positive patients into nursing homes.”Furthermore, staff shortages in some cases led to “risk taking with staff in some facilities having to continue to work while ill and in other cases encouraging people back from isolation.”“Other staff, frightened for their own health and aware of the Covid-19 payments, chose to stay away with the result that some nursing homes were so short staffed that phone calls from extremely concerned and distressed relatives went unanswered in some cases for days.”It will say, “staff transfers from the public sector to the private sector were on a voluntary basis, negotiations took up valuable time and delivered little. From the perspective of one person involved, ‘The cavalry never came’.”Speaking in advance of the hearing, Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly said “the opening statement from Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) for the Oireachtas Covid19 Committee reveals the failure of the Government and the HSE to put a proper plan in place for nursing homes before they became gripped by the Covid crisis.“It further points out that planning and the cost of managing the pandemic fell on the shoulders of nursing homes and how the Department of Health only belatedly intervened.“The whole statement points to a complete failure of the State to enact a structural plan for the nursing home sector, with the necessary financial and staffing resources, until late in the day.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Protesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownLeader missed out on a seat as the venue was too full under Covid-19 restrictionsSecond most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism was taken into custody when he was sixStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Prime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeCases in region limited to 17 with no deaths recorded thanks to effective quarantineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4262894.1590489400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"might coronavirus trauma permanently change new york","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk along the East River on Monday, US Memorial Day, in New York. Photograph: Jason SzenesEPAJust over a year ago, before the modern plague descended, Manhattan’s Hudson Yards threw a launch party that was Versailles-like in its overabundance of champagne, oysters, top chefs, beautiful people and other trappings of a great city.But on a recent afternoon, Hudson Yards was a ghost town. Its 93,000sq m shopping mall was shuttered and its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, would soon declare bankruptcy. The Vessel public art sculpture – likened by one reviewer to a giant doner kebab, and usually teeming with tourists – was empty but for a security guard patrolling its base.The only foot traffic was a steady stream of soldiers, who had been treating Covid-19 patients at the hastily-erected field hospital at the nearby Javits convention centre. They were lined up, at six-foot intervals, to collect free meals at a Hudson Yards storefront that had been converted into a soup kitchen.Alongside them were delivery drivers, postal workers, office cleaners and others manning the frontlines in New York City’s struggle against coronavirus.The tableau is a reminder of how drastically the virus has transformed New York, which has potentially suffered more deaths than any other city in the world, in just a matter of weeks. As New Yorkers inch towards a reopening, probably next month, according to mayor Bill de Blasio, they are contemplating with trepidation how their city will emerge from the pandemic – and what sort of future it will find on the other side.More than other large cities, New York exemplifies the urban characteristics that the virus has turned into vulnerabilities – population density, sky-high cost of living, a reliance on retail, culture and tourism and a dependence on crowded public transport.The modern history of New York City is one of periodic disasters shadowed by the fear of exodus – to other cities that are cheaper, safer, more convenient. There was the 1970s fiscal crisis and the decay that followed the 1987 stock market crash the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis – not to mention various hurricanes, floods and power outages.Yet in each case the doomsayers were proved wrong. The city bounced back stronger than before, and in some ways, reinvented itself. September 11th, for example, gave rise to a more vibrant downtown and set in motion Hudson Yards, a $25 billion development on Manhattan’s west side that is North America’s largest.After 2008, the world’s financial capital morphed into a technology hub to rival Silicon Valley and strengthened its magnetic pull on a new generation of talent.“No one is working in New York because it’s cheaper or easier. Nobody. It’s because the talent is here,” says Mary Ann Tighe, chair for the tri-state area at CBRE, the real estate services group.Reflexive faithCarl Weisbrod, a veteran of city government who led the revival of Times Square in the late 1980s under Ed Koch and was recently appointed by de Blasio to a new task force to guide the city’s recovery, acknowledges that the next 18 months will be difficult. But he also concludes that “as long as New York holds on to its talent, I have no doubt whatsoever that, as an economic matter, it will recover”.Other civic leaders tend to echo that reflexive faith in New York’s future. Some even talk about a unique opportunity to reimagine the city – to clear away nettlesome business regulation built up over generations, attract new industries, or correct the social inequities exposed by the crisis.As de Blasio said recently: “If ever there was a moment, a breakpoint moment, in the city’s history, this is it. It’s time to look anew at everything we do and see what works, what doesn’t work.”Before New York can set about reinventing itself there is uncertainty, even among its most ardent supporters, as to how the city will bridge the immediate catastrophe. Many are plagued by a troubling sense that this time is different.“This is much more complicated,” says Carol Kellermann, who ran the charitable fund created after the September 11th terror attack and also led the Citizens Budget Commission advisory group. “I think it’s going to have much deeper, longer-lasting impacts.”September 11th was brutal and devastating but the world rallied around the city and its economy resumed within days. After 2008, New York City ended up benefiting from policies that pumped vast sums of liquidity into the financial system.With coronavirus, there is no quick fix in sight. The city’s morgues are overflowing after more than 21,000 fatalities – roughly eight times the city’s toll from the 911 attacks – and some are forecasting unemployment will rise to 20 per cent in June. Yet the city is arousing less sympathy from the nation than partisan resentment. New York feels alone.Worst of all, the very thing that distinguishes New York City and accounts for its unique alchemy – its density –is what makes it so vulnerable to the pandemic. “Other than better treatments and a vaccine, I don’t know that there’s any government policy that can make people feel safer,” Kellermann says.Those with the means have left, quarantining in places such as the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Aspen. How many will have gone for good, she wonders, if the city’s cultural life is effectively closed and therefore unable to offset its high taxes and other indignities.“There’s definitely going to be urban flight,” says Winston Fisher, a third-generation developer, who voiced an ever-present fear among New Yorkers of a certain vintage about a reversion to the bad old days. “I grew up in the city. I’ve been robbed at gunpoint. I remember what 59th and 6th used to look like, Times Square,” he recalls. “New York City can be bad. Don’t forget that.”DecontaminationTo prevent that, there is an emerging consensus that authorities must create a sense of safety, just as they managed to do after September 11th. Otherwise, it will be impossible to restore business – let alone bring back tourists. It is a public health challenge but also a psychological one.In the absence of a vaccine, the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, has turned to former mayor Michael Bloomberg to spearhead a testing and tracing system. The hope is that as the city begins to reopen, the testers will be able to quickly find new infections and seal them off before they become outbreaks. As Cuomo readily acknowledges, it is a huge undertaking.Meanwhile, developers are rushing to refit office buildings that had been designed to accommodate a taste for ever-increasing density. Lifts are being reprogrammed to respond to smartphone apps so there is no need for users to touch a button. Internal doors are being removed for the same purpose.A critical focus in this decontamination is the world’s biggest – and possibly most blighted – underground system. The politan Transportation Authority has begun a regime that would have been unimaginable just a few months ago: to scrub and disinfect each subway car and station every single day.“New York City and the MTA are fundamentally built on density. That density creates intellectual collaboration and culture and business and Wall Street and finance and design,” says Pat Foye, the MTA chairman, explaining the subway’s essential role as the circulatory system for a global metropolis.Foye predicts that new cleaning technologies “could be real game-changers in terms of public confidence in the system”. But cleanliness will come at a cost: he estimates “hundreds of millions of dollars” in additional expense at a time when passenger traffic and fare revenue are down by more than 90 per cent.The MTA has received $3.9 billion (€3.6 bilion) in emergency funding from the federal government and is already pleading for another $3.9 billion infusion just to make it through this year.That is but one example of the fiscal challenges now lurking at every turn. De Blasio, whose administration has added 30,000 workers to the city’s payroll since he took office in 2014, has estimated the budget shortfall caused by the virus shutdown at $7.4 billion. Others have put it closer to $10 billion.Whatever the figure, Seth Pinksy, who led economic development during the Bloomberg administration, worries that it may pose the most direct threat to a virtuous circle in which talent and companies have chased each other to the city.“The key to New York’s success over the last 20-plus years has been the first-class workforce it has been able to attract,” says Pinsky, who recently took over as the head of the 92nd Street Y, one of the city’s leading cultural institutions. “What I worry about is that as government starts to react to the fiscal situation we are going to be forced to make cuts to basic services that are going to be so devastating that they will undermine the quality of life in the city.”Punishing tax cutFinding ways to preserve restaurants, museums, galleries and the like was not just “having a soft spot for arts and culture”, Pinsky says. Rather, it was essential to maintain the appeal – and viability – of an otherwise expensive and challenging place to live.When Donald Trump was elected president, some New Yorkers consoled themselves that he was, at least, one of them, and could therefore be counted on to look out for the city’s interests. But his sustained hostility to the city that voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016 is dimming hopes for federal support.Trump’s 2017 tax cut was largely paid for by punishing New York and a group of other, Democratic-leaning high-tax states. Even if Trump were inclined to help, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has dismissed pleas for coronavirus aid as “blue-state bailouts”.After September 11th, Bloomberg responded to the downturn by raising property taxes, a stream of revenue that accounts for nearly a third of New York City’s $89 billion budget. But that trick will not be easily repeated.Developers may be in no position to shoulder a heavier financial burden at a time when many of their own tenants have stopped paying rent. They are also confronting a larger fear: after a crash course in remote working, some of the city’s biggest employers – including BlackRock and Morgan Stanley – have announced they will require less office space in the future. If that conclusion is widespread, then Manhattan property values may be headed for a reckoning.Even before coronavirus, the wealthy were beginning to flee the city’s rising taxes for places such as Florida and Texas. “People are leaving New York and they’re leaving New York in droves,” says Norman Radow, a one-time New York developer who is now based in Atlanta. The coronavirus, he adds, “is just the icing on the cake”.Still, Radow’s own experience made him wonder if there might be investment opportunities ahead. He first moved to Manhattan in 1978, the depths of the fiscal crisis, and bought a two-bedroom apartment for $63,000. “Everyone thought it was the end of New York,” he recalls. “And look what happened.”Next phaseAmid the wreckage there are shards of hope. Some are warming to the possibility that a city that became so overheated in this cheap-money era – a bastion of billionaires, ensconced in Hudson Yards – might now undergo a pandemic-induced reset. Cheaper rents may eventually make the city more accessible for a new generation, who will put spaces to use in ways their elders can scarcely imagine.“It always happens after every crisis. It seeds the next phase,” says Daniel Kaplan, senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. The shared workspaces provider WeWork, Kaplan notes, was born from the unused office space left in the wake of the 2008 crisis.Kellermann agrees: “My daughter, who’s 35, says it’s going to go back to what it was in the ’70s and ’80s – grittier, but more risk-takers.” (She acknowledges that her daughter had not actually experienced New York in the 1970s – a time when the annual murder rate breached 2,000 and the subway was off-limits after nightfall.)Fisher now sees a rare chance to streamline an antiquated city government and improve the flow of credit to small businesses. Like other members of the business community, he would also like the city to prioritise the life sciences industry as a next source of high-paying jobs – just as the Bloomberg administration cultivated the tech sector.Even with Amazon’s decision last year to cancel plans for a second headquarters in Queens, New York City has still managed to attract billions of dollars in investment from the online retailer, and Facebook and Google, that have shined and reshaped the city’s west side, including Hudson Yards.Weisbrod wants to build more affordable housing. “I think the pendulum has swung way too far against development,” he says. “Everybody says they want more affordable housing but nobody wants it in their neighbourhood.”With coronavirus prying open the public’s eyes to the disparities between rich and poor, there may be the chance. At the same time, Weisbrod and other civic leaders worry how the crisis will eventually shape the city’s politics. Will it be a constructive force that brings reform – or a isive one that ultimately pits communities against one another?The race next year to succeed de Blasio as mayor may be one of the most consequential campaigns in the city’s modern history. Will his successor be another self-described “progressive” or a member of the executive class, in the mold of Bloomberg – or something else entirely? Whoever prevails should have faith in New York’s resilience but also, as Pinsky warns, not forget its darker days.“Those were ugly times,” he says of the 1970s, when New York City’s economic base was wrecked and its population shrank by 800,000 residents. “It took us decades to crawl out of that hole. We should be very careful about not falling back in.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

GPs were told to stop seeing patients face-to-face and to triage all cases by phone or video in case of infections.As a result of the measures, NHS capacity was not breached, and the Nightingale hospitals were barely used.But there are major concerns about the collateral damage the population is facing because of delays to accessing key health services for a lengthy period.The number of patients given an urgent referral for suspected cancer dropped by a fifth in the first month of the pandemic. Officials believe this is because patients with lumps in their breasts, blood in their urine or other red flag symptoms are putting off seeing a GP until the virus crisis is over.Cancer Research UK estimates that the number of deaths from cancer could rise by 18,000 in one year alone, while doctors have warned of a dramatic fall in the numbers coming forward when they need immediate help, with fears that heart attacks and strokes are being missed until it is too late.Official statistics show less than half as many patients are going to A\u0026ampE, with fewer than one million visits in April compared to 2.1 million a month before the pandemic began. Charities fear a host of other devastating consequences will be seen, either because services were stopped or because the public was fearful of accessing them.Official figures on Friday showed 36,393 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. But the Office for National Statistics also tracks excess deaths, which could include people who missed out on care for other conditions because of the crisis. Since the Covid-19 pandemic reached Britain, there have been 44,742  excess deaths in England and Wales compared to what would be expected over the period. Of those, 37,375 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate.As well as cutting lives short, the crisis may have a devastating impact on the quality of many lives, experts have warned. People with dementia may have deteriorated after being denied family visits and because of lack of access to routine services.And postponing operations – such as hip, knee and cataract surgery – has left thousands of people, many elderly, in increased pain or with limited vision. The backlog of cancelled operations could take years to be cleared.Charities have also voiced concern about the impact of the lockdown on the country\u0027s mental health, which will add to pressures facing the NHS. In particular, there are worries about the impact of loneliness and depression on the elderly, with research suggesting it has the same impact on life expectancy as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.Despite a host of technology challenges, the one positive legacy of coronavirus for the NHS is that the restrictions of social distancing have forced a digital revolution that had previously been little more than rhetoric.Nine in 10 GP practices are now offering video consultations, and a recent survey found 18 per cent of hospital specialists have been carrying them out. When the Royal College of Physicians carried out a similar survey last year, they found that fewer than six per cent were doing so.Phone appointments and online messaging have also proved popular, with the NHS now routinely adopting practices which, until recently, had been largely been promoted by the private sector.The desperate hunt for a vaccine or treatment for coronavirus has seen thousands of clinical trials suspended, meaning patients will wait far longer for new therapies, new figures show.Just a quarter of the trials overseen by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) are progressing as usual, with a further 16 per cent forced to make changes. Nearly six in 10 have been stopped entirely.A survey by the institute – to which 4,758 of 5,544 study groups responded – found that 2,817 trials have ground to a halt. If extrapolated to all the trials, it could mean as many as 3,409 have shut down since the start of the epidemic.In March, the NIHR also suspended new applications for trials, saying coronavirus must be given the highest priority, although that decision was reversed on May 21 and the institute said it would be working towards resuming ongoing research and setting up new trials.Yet with labs requisitioned for mass coronavirus testing, a lack of clinical supplies and research nurses drafted to help on the frontline, the U-turn is unlikely to bring any immediate relief.Many patients have been unable to leave lockdown to attend trials, and studies have experienced such damaging interruptions that they will need to start again or have to be abandoned completely. There are also fears that charities will no longer be able to afford to fund research, with many experiencing huge drops in donations since the virus crisis began.The Association of Medical Research Charities (AMRC) believes there will be a £250 million shortfall in available funds for trials and research in 2021 from its members. More than 900 (70 per cent) of clinical studies funded by AMRC charities, involving 148,000 patients, are currently stopped, paused or delayed.Aisling Burnand MBE, the chief executive of AMRC, said: For many patients, the opportunity to take part in clinical research provides hope, and losing this opportunity is devastating. Clinical research is vital to the development of new treatments and improved understanding of diseases, and for some it can be a crucial lifeline. Stopping trials can have a significant physical and emotional impact.Cancer Research UK funds around 200 trials involving 25,000 patients but said it had been forced to cut funding, pause research and stop recruiting for new trials. The charity is expecting to see a 25 per cent decline in fundraising income this year because of the pandemic, which it says will directly impact its goal to see three in four people survive cancer by 2034.Emlyn Samuel, Cancer Research UK\u0027s head of policy, said: This is particularly worrying for cancer patients with few other treatment options.Hospitals where trials have been paused would not have taken the decision lightly – one of the major factors has been concern for patient safety, as the consequences for cancer patients of getting Covid-19 can be very serious. In some cases, patients have continued to be treated on trials thanks to changes to protocol such as follow-up appointments up by phone instead of face-to-face.Plans to get clinical trials back up and running when safe and able to do so are in place, and we\u0027ve heard that some cancer trials have already started recruiting patients again. But it\u0027s important that more trials restart as quickly as possible to ensure cancer patients can access innovative treatments.The British Lung Foundation said it was forced to pause a phase two clinical trial for new drugs to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma, a condition for which there is currently no cure and which just five per cent of men, and 10 per cent of women, survive for more than five years. Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: This is not good news for a cancer where survival rates are dismal and there is no cure.We completely understand the need to focus on Covid-19 right now, but the impact will be colossal, with huge repercussions on the research community and patients who, heartbreakingly, don’t have time to spare. This will mean delays in the trial going ahead and any potential new treatments reaching those who need them.”Elsewhere, most major drugs companies have been forced to stop trials. In March, Geneva-based Addex announced that it would delay the start of a clinical trial to treat involuntary movements in people with Parkinson\u0027s disease.The US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly announced that it would halt enrolment in 86 ongoing studies and delay the launch of new trials, including 30 in final phases. GSK has also paused new trial recruitment, while Roche said it had seen impacts on clinical trial continuity in all the regions where we conduct clinical studies.Belgian drug maker Galapagos has paused enrolment into seven studies of filgotinib, a drug to treat diseases of the immune system.Many life-changing drugs which were expected to come to the market this year are now likely to be delayed, including asthma medicine tezepelumab, fitusiran, a hemophilia therapy, and ozanimod, for multiple sclerosis.The Alzheimer\u0027s Society has called for emergency financial support from the Government to help charities survive the lockdown and get trials back on track. Fiona Carragher, its director of research and influencing, said help was needed to continue funding life-saving research to improve the lives of people with dementia and provide hope for the future.Kate Shaw, the CEO of Innovative Trials, which helps recruit patients, said three-quarters of the trials it supports had been disrupted, and warned that the economic fallout from coronavirus could make it difficult to resume research even after lockdown.Getting trials back up and running will need a lot of investment from pharmaceutical companies, she warned. It will not be business as usual.Dr Elizabeth Robertson, the director of research at Diabetes UK, said many of the healthcare researchers iy funded had been recruited to the NHS frontline.Last week, the NIHR set out a new framework to try and help some trials resume or get started.Dr. William van\u0027t Hoff, the chief executive of the NIHR Clinical Research Network, and senior responsible officer for the NIHR Restart Programme said: We know taking part in healthcare research is good for patients and good for the NHS, so it\u0027s right that we make sure research can be resumed as soon as NHS or care services are able to restart across the country.The claim that coronavirus does not discriminate is inaccurate on many levels. But it is, perhaps, most inaccurate when it comes to its impact on education. In the two months since England, Wales and Scotland closed schools and sent children home, experiences of remote learning have been varied.Some schools have laid out a full timetable of home learning activities for pupils, while others have been slow to get their act together. Even where teachers are doing their best to organise activities for children to work on at home, whether the children actually do the work or not is another matter.Professor Lee Elliot Major, an expert in social mobility, says a home learning ide is inevitable as not all children will benefit from the study space, computers, internet and general support you might find in middle-class households.A poll by the Sutton Trust and Public First, taken just after the Easter holidays, found that two thirds of children had not taken part in any online lessons during lockdown. It also found that pupils at private schools are more than twice as likely to receive daily online tuition than their state-educated peers.  Fifty per cent of teachers in private schools said they are receiving more than three-quarters of work back, compared with 27 per cent in the best state schools and just eight per cent in the least advantaged state schools.  Another indicator of the rich-poor ide in home learning is the boom in online tutoring during lockdown, with many firms reporting a surge in demand for their services. Children from better-off households are more than twice as likely to have had more than £100 spent on their education since the shutdown, a study has found. Ministers have attempted to address the issue by promising to deliver laptops and 4G routers to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.But it is not just children from deprived households that are falling behind. Lazy youngsters, regardless of their family\u0027s income, are also struggling to keep up with their education at home. As the chief inspector of schools pointed out, children who lack motivation will also be among the biggest losers from the lockdown.And apart from the impact on children\u0027s academic progress, there is also the social and emotional cost of closing schools. Children are missing their normal routine, seeing their friends and end-of-year events such as sports day, as well as other rites of passage like a leavers\u0027 ball.Students in older years are missing the opportunity to take their GCSE and A-level exams and are instead being handed predicted grades by their teachers, based on previous work which they did not know at the time would count for anything.Schools have not, of course, been entirely closed during lockdown. They have remained open for the children of key workers and the most vulnerable youngsters, with ministers predicting that up to 10 per cent of pupils would still attend. But in reality, attendance has been as low as one per cent at times, with many parents choosing to keep their children at home even if they are eligible for a school place.The Government had intended for primary schools to begin a phased reopening next month, with pupils in Reception, Year One and Year Six returning first. But in the face of opposition from unions and local councils, ministers now acknowledge that some schools may choose to remain shut for longer.Since lockdown began two months ago, it has been a struggle for the Armed Forces to carry on as normal. In March, the Army halted all face-to-face training, while the May entry for recruits to join the Britannia Royal Navy College in Dartmouth, the naval academy at which the Duke of Edinburgh was trained and where he first met the Queen, was suspended. While a phased restart of socially-distanced training resumed for many at the beginning of the month, the Army acknowledged that any interruption in training has the potential to impact Army numbers. In order to protect the nation, we need to ensure we have enough soldiers trained to continue operations and other essential tasks, it said. Under the new measures, recruits and officer cadets returning to establishments like the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst were informed that, in order to adhere to the Government\u0027s advice, they would become a gated community with all visits off-site, from going home at the weekend to going to the shops, cancelled.James Heappey, the armed forces minister, previously warned that, if training did not resume while lockdown was still in place, we cannot hope to have that capability which we need to keep our nation safe next year. Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence select committee, warned that the virus crisis was proving the perfect global distraction for adversaries and competitors to regroup, as well as weak democracies to see authoritarian leaders leverage legitimate emergency powers to tackle the virus for their own advantage.Threats to global security were already on the increase prior to this outbreak, and we are likely to see a very fragile post-Covid world order, he told The . It\u0027s critical countries such as ourselves take a proactive role on the international stage and resume our duties as quickly as possible.However, Andrew Brooks, the director of Air League, a leading aviation and aerospace charity, said the Ministry of Defence was intelligently managing the risk during the crisis, citing the Typhoon package in Lithuania which has managed to operate within Covid-19 requirements and the way in which HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain\u0027s most powerful warship, was still able to sail with F-35s on board at the end of last month despite the unfolding crisis.  The effects of coronavirus have not just been felt at home. A number of overseas exercises were postponed in order to reduce international travel to a minimum, including the Joint Warrior operation, the largest military exercise in Europe, which brings together all three forces, along with forces from other nations, to practice airborne assaults, amphibious landings, evacuations and live-fire exercises.Other overseas exercises halted included the Swift Response exercise, where 600 British personnel train alongside American and French allies in Croatia, and Prairie Storm, a 35-day exercise on the British Army Training Unit Suffield training area in Canada, which prepares soldiers and officers for future deployments. Training missions in Iraq, where the British Military has held a presence since 2014, were paused for 60 days as a precaution due to the global pandemic.  While the MoD ensured key military personnel retained a presence throughout the country, a number were deployed back to the UK.As the UK has reached the peak of the crisis, the military\u0027s involvement in the pandemic has been reassessed. In a written statement to Parliament earlier this week, Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said the MoD\u0027s contribution and force posture was to be tailored to the evolving situation so it can both respond to Covid-19 and continue fulfilling other critical defence outputs. Now, just 7,500 personnel from its original 20,000 personnel will continue to operate as part of the Covid Support Force, so that they can return to other tasks and preparations for future operations.Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the Royal United Services Institute, added that it was important not to underestimate the lessons that can be learnedfrom the military\u0027s involvement in the Government response to the crisis.One of their top priorities has been to support the national effort at home, he told The . They have done a lot to fill the gaps in civilian absences. They have spare capacity designed to respond to crisis.Mr Chalmers added that one of the questions the military will need to ask is how it recognises and re-prioritises for national military tasks and what lessons the military can contribute to the Government. Perhaps these will be addressed in the long-anticipated Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy, delayed as a result of the pandemic. For now, only time will tell.If it is true that justice delayed is justice denied, then the suspension of all jury trials on March 23 only served to make a growing crisis in this country even worse.Before the lockdown was even announced, the backlog of criminal cases waiting to get going sat at a staggering 37,000. This meant some victims of crime, including those who had been raped or violently assaulted, might have to wait more than a year to see their attacker in the dock.Throughout the two months (and counting) of lockdown, another 2,000 cases have been heaped onto the backlog. Lawyers fear it will be years before the system catches up, increasing the risk that some criminals will escape justice.While the courts might have largely ceased work during the pandemic, criminals did not, so work began last month to try to get things moving again.A Jury Trials Working Group, chaired by Mr Justice Edis, was set up and the first tentative steps to resumption were taken on Monday, with a handful of jury trials beginning at three crown courts including the Old Bailey.There are plans to expand in the coming weeks but, with social distancing measures having to be maintained, even a simple case is proving a logistical headache, with hearings usually spread across two separate rooms connected via video link.As a result, more space is needed and plans are being discussed to commandeer other public buildings such as theatres, churches and leisure centres to serve as temporary courts.More radical proposals, including a move away from the 900-year-old jury system and the introduction of judge-only trials, have also been suggested.The Lord Chief Justice recently warned that the crisis would need some imaginative thinking from the Government, but lawyers fear the delays may take years to resolve.Amanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: In just two months, Covid-19 has struck at the heart of the operation of the entire justice system.Because many courts are closed and others are not operating at anything like full capacity, the existing backlog of cases has increased at an alarming pace, even with the judiciary conducting remote hearings.These ever-growing delays mean witnesses, victims and defendants who are waiting to go to court, are left in limbo, losing engagement with the system and connection to their case.She also warned of the impact the lockdown was having on the legal profession, with a recent survey suggesting that over three quarters of criminal barristers will have gone out of business by October.Caroline Goodwin QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, agreed that the lockdown had dealt a devastating blow to the administration of justice.She said: The upshot of a growing case backlog is that justice is going to be further delayed for victims of crime, their families, witnesses and defendants waiting in limbo to clear their name in court.Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society, also painted a bleak picture and warned that the public\u0027s ability to access swift justice would be severely impacted.Evidence may be impaired by the length of time between the events in issue and the trial. Those wrongly accused will wait far longer to clear their names, he explained. Where people are kept on remand, the remand prison population will increase, and people may end up spending more time in prison than any sentence they would receive if convicted.Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs Council, admitted there was concern among police leaders about the growing backlog, saying: We are working really hard with our Ministry of Justice colleagues to make sure we can get the system up and running as soon as we can. There is a lot of work going on to identify ways to get through the backlog.While jury trials were halted, magistrates\u0027 courts, which handle the bulk of criminal cases, have continued to sit, making use of technology to ensure hearings can still take place.John Bache, the national chair of the Magistrates\u0027 Association, said that, as lockdown was lifted and the justice system began operating fully again, there would inevitably be practical issues to address.By their nature, magistrates\u0027 courts are busy public spaces that bring together people who would not otherwise come into contact with each other, he said. This creates some challenges in how best to enable courts to handle more cases and we are impressed by the continuing efforts of Her Majesty\u0027s Courts and Tribunals Service to protect the health of all court users.“This will require an approach that combines a greater use of video technology, rigorous social distancing within courthouses and robust case management to ensure that court time is used efficiently.Police and charities were braced for a surge in domestic violence when Britain went into lockdown after rises of 30 per cent and more in China and France early in their outbreaks. In Hubei, the pandemic epicentre, it tripled year on year in February.What has happened in the UK is, however, more nuanced and as yet not fully explained. Police figures show domestic abuse incidents have risen by just four per cent during the lockdown, although this contrasts with a 25 per cent fall in overall crime in the same period.Yet, the number of calls to domestic abuse helplines and online requests for information from charities have risen by 30 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.Charities fear this could be because victims are trapped by the lockdown in their homes with their abusers, out of sight of relatives and neighbours who often raise the alert on their behalf and unable to escape from the house with their controlling partner watching their every move 247.They fear that coming out of lockdown there could be an explosion in cases.This was why this week the Home Office launched a “codeword” scheme where victims will be able to approach staff in supermarkets and pharmacies to say the word and be taken to a safe space in the store to call police or the national domestic abuse helpline.“It’s designed for those victims who may have no other opportunity to seek help, maybe because their phone has been removed by the perpetrator or they cannot use it in front of the perpetrator or they may not have internet access,” said one of the charity initiators of the scheme.It is also why police - backed by victims’ groups, charities and the Government - have tried to adopt a more proactive approach including visiting potential abuse victims alone at home. Their partner who may be subject to bail or a protection order is told to attend an appointment elsewhere.Police play down reports of a doubling in the rate of women and child murders during the lockdown, which stand at 19, according to the Counting Dead Women group.But charities are prepared for any surge in reports as lockdown is eased and “hidden” abuse surfaces. And it is not just partner abuse.The pandemic has also shone a light on other “Cinderella” forms of domestic abuse that have not had the same national profile or even support.The number of elderly abused by relatives or carers has risen by as much as 37 per cent during lockdown, according to Hourglass, a charity which runs the national helpline for elderly abuse.It has had to ert and increase staffing to deal with the surge in calls. Yet, despite a £60,000 cash injection from the Government, it faces a financial crisis and may have to start scaling back its operations in three months as it digs into reserves.The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it had seen a sharp decline particularly in elderly people - and children and young people - with mental health problems seeking help during lockdown primarily because of their or their parents’ fears of contracting the virus if they visited NHS centres.Psychiatrists reported seeing a 45 per cent fall in routine appointments but 43 per cent increase in emergency cases, suggesting people were only seeking help once their mental health reached a crisis.“Our fear is that the lockdown is storing up problems which could then lead to a tsunami of referrals,” said Professor Wendy Burn, college president.The past two months have cast the UK economy into the most rapid and brutal recession the nation has ever seen.Eight million furloughed workers are being paid by the Government to down tools and stay at home.Entire industries have closed down overnight. Economic activity has ceased in a way never previously contemplated.It is a deliberate act to stop human contact and slow the spread of the virus.It has been extremely successful, with as much as one-third of economic activity wiped out for the period of the lockdown.The usual definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of falling GDP.This recession’s lightning speed is almost too rapid to meet that description.Rather than the ‘usual’ recession pattern of a boom turning to bust, this induced collapse sent a stable, if sluggish, economy into instant freefall.GDP fell 2pc in the first quarter of 2020, effectively matching the worst period of the financial crisis even though the virus only really struck the economy in the final month.In March alone monthly GDP plunged 5.8pc, almost matching the entire fall in the financial crisis. Economists expect a fall of as much as 20pc in the second quarter.More than one-fifth of the workforce in total is furloughed, and surveys by the Office for National Statistics show which industries have been hit hardest.Among businesses which have not permanently closed, more than three-quarters of food services and accommodation workers are being paid by the Treasury to stay at home. Almost two-thirds of those in arts, entertainment and recreation are doing the same, as are 45pc of construction workers.Having created the recession, the organs of the state have thrown everything they have at trying to ensure it is only temporary, so businesses and their staff can bridge this hole in GDP and get back to normal as quickly as possible.Andrew Bailey, the new Governor of the Bank of England, ramped up £200bn of quantitative easing and slashed interest rates to the new record low of 0.1pc, even hinting that the Bank could consider taking the rate below zero in future.Rishi Sunak, the new Chancellor, looks set to borrow more than £300bn this year to fund the furlough scheme, business loan guarantees, grants to small companies and tax breaks for empty high streets.In a sense, however, the recession may already be over.Some businesses have begun to reopen, which means GDP should be rising once more.Almost 80pc of accommodation and food services companies are closed, but of those now open, almost one-fifth reopened in the past fortnight.Construction and manufacturing businesses are also gearing up to go back to work.That said, the level of GDP remains far below its pre-pandemic peak. That means jobs are still at risk - for instance, restaurants implementing social distancing rules need fewer waiting staff, while businesses with depleted resources will have less money to spend on staff or to invest. Job vacancies plunged last month.At best, we are at the bottom of a very long slope leading back to a fully restored economy.Much of the financial pain of this crisis still lies ahead.The charity sector is on its knees, with fund raising activities cancelled, donations drying up and high street shops closed.Yet at a time when finances are stretched to the limit and staff have been furloughed, their services, such as domestic abuse, suicide and mental health support, are needed more than ever, with “staggering” increases in demand.Many, including the Alzheimer’s Society and the NSPCC, have launched appeals for urgent funding, warning that without a substantial and rapid cash injection their future is uncertain.As early as March 25, just days into lockdown, Rob Wilson, the former charities minister, warned in the  that the sector was on the brink of collapse.Weeks on, the outlook remains just as bleak.All of the nation’s 11,500 charity shops, which generate annual profits of some £330 million, remain closed, cutting off a vital lifeline for many organisations, as well as a wider community resource.Robin Osterley, chief executive of the Charity Retail Association (CRA), said: “Income across the sector has dropped off a cliff.“Events can’t be held, street fundraising is on hold, there is a clear trend for people to ert donations away from charities to the NHS.“Yet the demand for its services has never been greater - it’s a significant double whammy.”It is predicted that charities will have lost more than £4bn by the end of May. Experts have warned that Government support, which includes a £750m grant, has not been enough.“It’s not about propping up charities, it’s about the continuation of vital services,” Mr Osterley said, noting that if furloughed charity workers were allowed to return to work as volunteers, which many are keen to do, it would make a substantial difference.Each organisation is facing its own pressures. The number calling the British Heart Foundation’s helpline has doubled on average since the Covid-19 outbreak, requiring it to extend its helpline hours and add to its specialist nursing team.Yet with its 750 UK shops closed and fundraising events such as its flagship London to Brighton bike ride cancelled, the pandemic is estimated to be costing the charity around £10 million a month.Childline has been forced to close its night service and has seen volunteer hours drop by 30 per cent due to counsellors having to self-isolate, prompting the NSPCC to appeal to the public for £10 donations to ensure the service continues.More than half of the UK’s animal rescue centres have warned they have just three months of income remaining, with many facing imminent closure.And while the Trussell Trust, the country\u0027s biggest food bank network, has reported an 81 per cent increase in demand for emergency food parcels, donations nationally have fallen and volunteers - many of whom are elderly - have been forced to self-isolate.Roberta Fusco, director of policy and engagement at the Charity Finance Group, said: “We are needed now more than ever but the support has been taken away.“It took a long time to get the £750million package from Government and we’re still waiting for the majority of that to filter through.“Almost three quarters of charities with paid staff are using the furlough scheme, simply as a means to survive. Yet its very use represents a loss of both delivery and capacity.”It is not all doom and gloom. The herculean efforts of Captain Tom Moore, who raised £32.8m for NHS Charities Together means that every NHS charity across the UK has been given £35,000 as well as a second grant based on the size of the trust they serve.Other charities have witnessed a spike in donations and volunteers, particularly those providing emergency supplies and meals to the vulnerable, such as the Felix Project in London.Meanwhile, the Government has announced that VAT collected on donated PPE will be given to charities supporting the NHS and care workers.The high street we return to post lockdown could look very different to the one we left behind, according to retail analysts.While grocery and online sales have boomed with the nation stuck at home, in-store shopping at non-essential retailers has fallen to nothing.This led to a warning from Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, that as many as one in five shops plan to close permanently after restrictions are lifted.Only essential retailers, like supermarkets, have been allowed to open to customers since the lockdown was announced on March 23, while restaurants have only been allowed to offer takeaway.Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, the analysts, said: “A lot of retailers were already struggling financially so I think, for many, it will be the final nail in the coffin.”He said before the pandemic he estimated retailers had around 20 per cent more store space than they needed or could support. While he had thought this would be “stripped out” over the next decade, this will now be accelerated.That means shops will close their doors for good.However, it hasn’t all been such grim reading. Supermarket sales have performed strongly as they have been forced to swiftly adapt to a new way of working.Mr Lim said: “The grocery sector has shown its strength in terms of its adaptability.”Nick Carroll, of Mintel, another analyst, said that while larger grocers do prepare for cataclysmic events, the pandemic still came relatively out of the blue.However, they adapted quickly by boosting the number of delivery slots available and implementing strict social distancing policies in store, including ordered queues to enter and one-way systems inside.The lockdown has also caused changes in consumer behaviour. We have embraced shopping online, with the Royal Mail revealing this week that the number of parcels it handles has increased by 31 per cent during the lockdown.Mr Carroll said 40 per cent of people are spending more online and that this trend has been reflected with the older generations too, with 43 per cent of over-65s doing the same.Shoppers are also spending less on luxuries, something Mr Carroll said was to be expected during a recession, which experts warn is looming as a result of the economic impact of the virus.Mr Carroll said: “Nearly 46 per cent of people have cut back on non-essential spending. The majority of sales for retailers come from stores and consumers are cutting back.”Despite this, oddly, hobbies appear to have become more important to iniduals during the lockdown, perhaps because people have realised they need to alleviate the boredom of working from home.Sales of things like board games and puzzles have been strong, according to Mintel.Both analysts said some of these changes in consumer behaviour could be permanent or last for a long time. Data from the Royal Mail suggests that four in five people intend to continue spending online at the same level once the lockdown ends.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Coronavirus has been the single biggest disruption to the retail industry in decades and the measure of success for many firms will be whether they are still operating in six months’ time.“This is why Government support is so essential - to protect three million retail jobs and the local communities they are part of.”A glimmer of hope among the storm for retailers will be that many shoppers are looking forward to returning to the high street.The results of research recently carried out by Mintel found that 17 per cent of people are looking forward to a day out shopping when this is all over.They warned of a “ticking time bomb”. Care homes were already struggling to keep their doors open without hiking rates after their budgets were repeatedly slashed.Now, just when they’re needed the most, some have already been forced to close. Many others threaten imminent collapse after being ravaged by the pandemic. For them, the lockdown has meant that they have been locked in with the virus.Almost 15,000 care residents are suspected to have died of Covid-19, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates. Academics at the London School of Economics (LSE) suggest the figure is more like 22,000 - equating to one in 20 care home residents. Healthcare professionals warn the true figure is even higher.The Government has released £3.2billion of financial support to local authorities to support public services - including the care sector. Some care home managers have warned that they still haven’t received a penny of this money - or that they’re only receiving a 5pc increase in budget. Last week, as the death toll of the vulnerable and elderly continued to grow, ministers announced a further £600million injection to help tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes.Despite throwing money at the problem and devolving responsibility to local authorities, central Government is now asking itself - while the public and care sector have demanded to know for months - how, exactly, the lockdown has exacerbated the care homes crisis.Ministers stopped making international comparisons during the daily Downing Street briefings weeks ago, long after it backtracked on the ‘herd immunity’ plan and the World Health Organisation (WHO) deemed it a “dangerous concept”. Now the UK had the highest death toll in Europe - with almost half suspected of being in care homes - and is turning to the rest of the world for help to understand why.Jeremy Hunt, former health secretary who, in his current role as chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee, has begun conducting something of a ‘lessons learned’ post-mortem into the number of care home deaths after assembling a panel of witnesses from Hong Kong and Germany. On Tuesday morning he sat in front of his carefully curated bookshelf and asked a panel of international experts over a live-streamed hearing why the UK’s care home death toll was so high.“There have been 3,000 care home deaths in Germany and 12,500 in the UK” Mr Hunt said “What processes did you take regarding hospital discharges?”, he asked. The answers were clear. The Government\u0027s lockdown strategy meant that care home residents had been locked in with the virus - with increasing numbers of infected people allegedly being forced through their doors.Managers have spoken out about being forced to take in infected patients - even if they had not been tested - amid threats of being reported to police or social services. Giving evidence to Select Committee hearing, Isabell Halletz, CEO of Germany\u0027s employers\u0027 association for care homes, reiterated this. She said the reason why she had seen so few deaths in comparison to the UK during lockdown, was because they did not discharge infected patients into care homes where people were most vulnerable and likely to die of the virus. “This was the hot topic,” she said. “Either test or make sure these people coming from hospitals stay in quarantine for 14 days, whether inside the care homes or in separate health facilities like rehabilitation centres.” She even gave the UK some free tips - use Army doctors to help with care, use empty hotels to quarantine the sick and get tests for everyone - because some people are asymptomatic.Professor Terry Lum, Head of Social Work and Social Administration at Hong Kong University, chipped in: “We didn’t have a single healthcare professional being infected in Hong Kong”.  In the UK, at least 35 carers have died.  “In South Korea, there hasn’t been a single death in a care home,” Adelina Comas-Herrera, Assistant Professorial Research Fellow at LSE, added. This is despite both countries’ proximity to China and shorter time to prepare for the crisis.Someone signed off on a policy discharging older patients into care homes full of other older people with underlying health conditions - the legality of which is currently being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).Government guidelines encouraged care homes to accept discharged patients if they were asymptomatic, without testing. This guidance was abolished last month – but care providers warned that it was too late and the damage was already done. The UK’s lockdown was enforced on March 23. Unless care homes took it upon themselves to ban visitors, government guidance decreed that they were still allowed visitors as late as April 2.Now, at least 5,889 care homes have reported a suspected outbreak of symptomatic or confirmed coronavirus as of Monday. This equates to 38pc of all care homes in England. However there are some things which the UK has managed to do right during the lockdown, but the initiative has not come from those in power. Care experts estimate that around 20pc of carers - many of whom earn just above the minimum wage - have moved into their place of work in order to take care of elderly residents. In Spain, the Army found corpses abandoned in their beds in care homes. The lowest paid, hardest working members of UK society are doing everything they can to help keep the residents they care for safe, and alive. However the lockdown, and its mismanagement, has meant that carers and residents have been locked in their own homes along with the virus, with deadly consequences.The cultural sector was paralysed by closures just before the UK went into official lockdown, and two months in it appears the severe financial cost of coronavirus safety measures could continue long after lockdown has ended.In mid-March theatres, music venues, museums and galleries were closed to prevent large crowds, and experts fear continuing to avoid risky gatherings will further ravage balance sheets even when restrictions are eased.   Around £900 million is expected to be wiped from the billion-pound live music business in the UK, £330 million has been lost in the previously thriving theatre industry after venues shut their doors, and cultural organisations dependent on sales have lost the majority of their income while reserves have dwindled.The future of the nation’s heritage sites has also been thrown into doubt, with restoration experts and craftspeople left without business.  Museums have been badly affected with staff furloughed as the usually relentless tourist footfall was halted in London and across the country, although the Government’s job retention scheme has been credited with keeping staff, and grant funding can help ensure the future of institutions like the British Museum.  However, experts fear that even when the long lockdown is over, the broader sector will remain on its knees while vital audiences are diminished, and far from an economic recovery there will be a catastrophic collapse.West End producer Sonia Freedman has warned that: “70 per cent of our performing arts companies will be out of business before the end of this year. More than 1,000 theatres around the country will be insolvent and might shut down for good.”This is because theatre is incompatible with social distancing, making even accessing the bar or the bathroom a safety hazard if restrictions continue.The Royal Albert Hall chief executive Craig Hassall revealed that the venue\u0027s reserves have been ravaged during lockdown, and the hall could close as limiting capacity to ensure social distancing would mean fewer tickets sold, and financial ruin. The UK Live Music Group fears mass job losses and a £900 million economic hit, and has warned that more 500 grass roots venues face permanent closure.Two months into lockdown certain grand institutions, like the British Museum which receives a large amount of funding through grants, are thinking of how to safely reopen.While income from the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport remains secure, timed ticketing could allow some museums and galleries to open with limited capacity.Chairman of the National Museum Directors\u0027 Council Sir Ian Blatchford said museums will likely reopen in “a series of considered stages”, and options were already being considered for how to maintain social distancing and still get visitors through the doors. Elsewhere in the sector sales are essential, and limited capacities of 25-30pc would spell financial disaster and closure for the likes of the Old Vic, Royal Albert Hall, and Shakespeare’s Globe, which now faces potential insolvency. The reserves of theatre companies and venues are being swiftly depleted, with some West End playhouses enduring £30,000 weekly costs even while closed.This is also an issue for museums and galleries like the Royal Academy of Arts - losing £1 million each month - which do not receive their funding from grants, but must make their money through sales.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England said: “Safeguarding of their livelihoods will also determine the survival of our most precious heritage - if they go out of business during this difficult time, the hard truth is that some of our heritage will be lost forever.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus world round up countries easing lockdown could face","story":"Countries with declining coronavirus infections could face an immediate second peak if they let up on lockdown measures too quickly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. We need also to be cognizant of the fact that the disease can jump up at any time, said WHO emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan on Monday. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now, it is going to keep going down.Meanwhile, the WHO also announced it was suspending trials for a drug touted by Donald Trump as a cure for the coronavirus.The US President revealed he was taking hydroxychloriquine, an anti-malarial drug, last week. The nation has by far the world\u0027s highest death toll, reaching 98,218 on Monday, with more than 1.6 million confirmed infections.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has also heavily promoted hydroxychloroquine while the virus has exploded across nation, which this week became the second most infected in the world after the US.But the WHO decided to cancel trials after studies questioned the drug\u0027s safety, including one published Friday that found it actually increased the risk of death.In the past 24 hours, lockdown measures have been eased in Spain\u0027s two biggest cities Madrid and Barcelona, where people can now meet in groups of up to 10 in their homes or in parks or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. Beaches also reopen in parts of the country after months-long closures.Italy has reopened swimming pools and gyms, while Greece has done the same with restaurants and cafes. In Ukraine, citizens of Kiev can take the metro for the first time in 10 weeks.Iran has reopened its main shrines, India has resumed domestic flights and Japan has stressed caution but lifted a nationwide state of emergency.Joe Biden made his first public appearance in more than two months on Monday as he marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans park near his Delaware home.Since abruptly cancelling a March 10 rally in Cleveland at the onset of the pandemic, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has waged much of his campaign from his home in Wilmington.When Biden emerged on Monday, he wore a face mask, in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has refused to cover his face in public as health officials suggest.Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, laid a wreath of white flowers tied with a white bow, and bowed their heads in silence at the park. He saluted. Never forget the sacrifices that these men and women made, he said after. Never, ever, forget.I feel great to be out here, Mr Biden told reporters, his words muffled through his black cloth mask. His visit to the park was unannounced, and there was no crowd waiting for him.Though low-key, the appearance was a milestone in a presidential campaign that has largely been frozen by the outbreak. While the feasibility of traditional events such as rallies and the presidential conventions are in doubt, Mr Biden\u0027s emergence suggests he won\u0027t spend the nearly five months that remain until the election entirely at home.Saudi Arabia will begin easing restrictions on movement and travel this week, more than two months after stringent measures were introduced to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.Restrictions will be lifted in three phases, culminating in the curfew completely ending - with the exception of the holy city of Mecca - from June 21, the state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday.The Hajj and Umrah pilgrimmages - which attract millions of travelers from around the world - will remain suspended until further notice.The kingdom has so far recorded 74,795 cases of Covid-19 with 399 deaths. More than 2,000 cases are still being reported daily.Saudi Arabia had imposed 24-hour curfews on most towns and cities but eased them for the start of the fasting month of Ramadan. The 24-hour curfew was reimposed during the five-day Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday, which began on Sunday.Demonstrators defied restrictions to march in cities across Ecuador on Monday in protest against President Lenin Moreno\u0027s drastic economic measures to tackle the crisis.Mr Moreno last week announced public spending cuts including the closure of state companies and embassies around the world, but trade unions on Monday said workers were paying a disproportionate price compared to Ecuador\u0027s elite.Around 2,000 people marched in the capital, waving flags and banners and shouting anti-government slogans.Coronavirus has caused at least 3,200 deaths in the country, making it South America\u0027s worst hit nation per capita.

Defined as “the spirit of the British public pulling together to overcome times of adversity”, it has particular resonance today. On 26th May 1940 Operation Dynamo, the mission to rescue the British Expeditionary Force from France, began. The herculean efforts of the Royal Navy, the Merchant Navy and civilian volunteers, have become embedded in our national story.In his ‘we shall fight them on the beaches’ speech nine days later, Churchill said that “Wars are not won by evacuations”. True, but he knew they can be lost if such operations go badly wrong as for many days in that torrid time seemed all too likely.The Dunkirk story is now legendary. The qualities of courage and resilience in the face of extreme adversity are part of our identity, how we think of ourselves. This is exemplified by the Little Ships - the story of how a civilian armada helped save an army. Some say it was a miracle – an event so extraordinary that it surpasses all human powers. The truth is far more gutsy and practical, and utterly remarkable.Dunkirk was not a planned operation but an improvised one where initiative largely took the place of planning. Behind it all and led by the brilliant – and now overlooked – Vice Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, was a small team of men and women who, in tunnels deep under Dover Castle, hatched and guided the plan, adapting it to bounce back after every setback. In only a few days this team somehow found all the resources in ships, people and supplies required to lift an army. It was an almost superhuman effort, conducted by ordinary men and women. When it is safe to do so, you will be able once again to visit those tunnels, where English Heritage’s superb series of videos unfolds the story in the place where it actually happened.In France, retreating British and French forces dug in and held an area around Dunkirk while the evacuation proceeded. On the way in and out, ships had to fight off aircraft, E-boats and shore batteries, and negotiate explosive mines. Another, largely invisible, battle took place in the sky as the RAF engaged the Luftwaffe: catastrophic though the bombing of ships and beaches was, with over 230 vessels sunk, it could have been so much worse. It was an inferno in which the courage and determination of all those involved from all three Services enabled it enormously to exceed expectations. Having initially thought that about 50,000 could be saved, the total recovered was nearly 340,000, including some 140,000 French, Belgian and Dutch.Without the guiding hand of Ramsay and his team, it would have been a shambles. In a letter to his wife on 5th June he wrote: “… now all is done and the task is behind. The relief is stupendous. The results beyond belief. The success is mostly due to the first-class direction and management of the show, equally with glorious courage, skill and endurance of the personnel of all the ships. The one without the other would have been ineffective….”Although the circumstances of today are totally different, inevitably people will seek parallels. Improvisation was the key, together with quick decision-making 24 hours a day, often based on very limited information. Ideas had to be tried if they didn’t work – try something different.  Many mistakes were made and opportunities lost – it’s inevitable in chaotic situations like this. No decision one can take is without risk. Behind the apparent chaos – detailed planning, ruthless oversight by small,  focussed teams, and constant adjustments as the situation on the ground changed. If any of this is sounding at all familiar, I could add that one of Ramsay’s great joys at the end of it all was a long overdue visit to a hairdresser!English Heritage cares for Dover Castle and Ramsay’s tunnels on behalf of the nation and while the conservation charity will not be able to mark the 80th anniversary of the rescue mission from where it was masterminded, it will - using storytelling including first-hand accounts- evoke those desperate days on its Twitter channel.Sir Tim Laurence is Chairman of English Heritage.  Follow @EnglishHeritage and #Dunkirk1940 on Twitter to see the story unfoldMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should have gone barnard castle social media users mock cummings","story":"Dominic Cummings has been known for his brilliance in harnessing the power of social media to campaign against political opponents.However, the special adviser is now trending in a way he probably never thought he would - as the butt of many jokes and memes about his trip to Barnard Castle.Many made the point that an hour-long round trip in the car with a small child in the back was an unconventional way to test eyesight, joking that one should have gone to Barnard Castle instead of Specsavers.The Barnard Castle TripAdvisor page was also full of spoof reviews from people enjoying the joke.One wrote: Whizzed up on a whim from London with the family.

Latest advice on lockdown restrictions UK lockdown restrictions to be eased allowing more social contact and shops to reopenThe Chief Executive of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has called on the government to restrict access to the coast until there are lifeguards back on the beaches.Mark Dowie issued an open letter after two people died on Cornwall’s coastline on Monday. A 17-year-old girl died after getting trapped under a rigid-hulled inflatable boat near Porthilly Rock in Wadebridge.In a separate incident, at around 2.30pm a man was pulled from the sea by a member of the public at Treyarnon Bay in Padstow.With thousands flocking to English beaches now lockdown restrictions have been eased, we must choose between keeping the public or our lifeguards safe, Mr Dowie wrote.Safety advice and warnings will only go so far when people are desperate to enjoy some freedom after weeks of lockdown.As a lifesaving charity, the RNLI cannot stop people going to beaches – but the Government can – before more lives are lost around our coast this summer.Over the weekend 133 hotels and 65 campsites reopened in Croatia, igniting hopes that this summer season will not be completely lost to coronavirus.The country has enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity in the last two decades, and now relies heavily on overseas visitors – tourism represents around a quarter of its GDP – so it is no surprise that the tourist board is pushing for travellers to return. With 2,244 confirmed cases and 100 fatalities, the country is in a similarly encouraging position to Greece, which is also forging ahead with reopening plans in June. The Director of the Croatian Tourism Association, Veljko Ostojic, highlighted Croatia’s relative success in tackling the virus stating:A good epidemiological situation is a basis for achieving results this year and we are among the best in Europe in that regard.

I think that the UK has a big difference in terms of the current medical status of the country with Greece, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s likely it will be there, tourism minister Harry Theocharis told ITV. The UK recorded 1,625 new coronavirus cases and 121 new deaths on Monday, while in Greece the figure was just 4 and 1, respectively. For comparison, Germany saw 461 new cases and 57 new deaths yesterday and Italy 300 and 92.Greece\u0027s reticence to allow Britons to return could be a moot point, of course.

One said that talks were in the initial phase, while another said they hoped the agreement could allow Brits into Portugal and vice versa.Wondering what, exactly, an air bridge is? Greg Dickinson explains it all.Arapahoe Basin, one of the most popular ski resorts in Colorado, will reopen its slopes tomorrow as lockdown measures are eased across the United States, Lucy Aspden reports.“It’s going to be different from anything you’ve ever done at Arapahoe Basin,” said Al Henceroth, chief operating officer of the ski area.The resort, which was forced to close on March 15 due to the pandemic, is bringing in a number of measures to ensure social distancing measures are adhered to. Skiers and snowboarders will have to make a reservation before they visit and there will only be a small, limited number of lift tickets available to buy in advance – just 600 people will be allowed on the mountain each day.The resort joins a list of other American resorts that have decided to make the most of the remaining snow – Mount Baldy in California reopened last month much to the delight of its local fans, despite state and local orders prohibiting non-essential businesses from operating amid the pandemic. Arapahoe, which boasts an impressive snow record, is often one of the last resorts in the northern hemisphere to close each year, with skiing often possible until the Independence Day weekend and July 4 celebrations.Arapahoe ski resort will reopen tomorrowNeed some UK inspiration? Here are 10 great summer holiday ideas, from remote hikes to luxury yurts, chosen by Penny Walker. Explore the great British outdoors this summerCharlotte Johnstone reports that the loss of Shearings, the UK\u0027s biggest coach tour company, could have a devastating impact on dozens of popular holiday spots:The firm\u0027s three accommodation brands, Bay Hotels, Coast \u0026amp Country Hotels and Country Living Hotels, operated 44 UK properties in towns such as Harrogate, Bath, Newquay, Torquay and Llandudno. With the collapse of Shearings, they too have ceased trading, and unless they can find a new buyer willing to take a gamble on making money in the current climate, face permanent closure.The low-cost airline will return to the sky on June 15 and has shared its first post-coronavirus route map. It\u0027s a skeleton affair, with services to only 22 airports. UK routes include Gatwick to Edinburgh, Belfast, the Isle of Man, Inverness, Glasgow and Nice (its solitary route from Britain to Europe). Greg Dickinson reports that Japan is looking to boost tourism by subsidising a portion of travellers’ expenses, as the country lifts its state of emergency and eases lockdown restrictions.In a news conference last week, Hiroshi Tabata of the Japan Tourism Agency announced plans to allocate $12.5 billion (£10.2 billion) to a new reimbursement programme for tourism.It is not clear whether the scheme would target domestic tourists only, or if it could be rolled out to international visitors as well. Some reports suggest Japan could follow the lead of Sicily, which is looking to lure back foreign travellers by paying half their air fares and offering one free night of accommodation for every three nights spent there.The Portuguese islands of Madeira and Porto Santo will reopen to international travellers on July 1, it has been announced.Arrivals will have to either present a negative coronavirus test done no more than 72 hours prior to departure or be tested upon arrival, free of charge.Madeira has spent recent weeks billing itself as a Covid-free destination, while the rest of Portugal has been equally keen to kickstart tourism. The country\u0027s Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said last week that travellers will soon be welcome to return with no obligation to self-isolate on arrival. Madeira is getting ready to reopenSimon Parker isn\u0027t letting the lockdown stop him wandering the globe:First in are the French beans. Their remains have been found in Mexican and Guatemalan archaeological sites that date back 7,000 years, but they were most likely first domesticated in Peru.Christopher Columbus introduced them to Europe at the end of the 1400s, and over the next few centuries they migrated east to Indochina and the Indian subcontinent. I’ve seen them grow as big as boomerangs in the foothills of the Himalayas under multi-coloured prayer flags. Some French restaurants serve them crunchy, in goose fat and breadcrumbs, but I’ll likely cook mine Bhutanese-style, in a cheese and chilli sauce. My taste buds can still wander, even if the rest of me can’t. While it seems Britons must wait until July 4 to enjoy a domestic holiday, the Isle of Man yesterday gave the green light for self-catering properties to reopen. The move comes after camping facilities were given permission a week ago.Travel between the Isle of Man and the UK is still prohibited, but it is hoped islanders will take the chance to enjoy a “staycation” in the coming weeks. Other lifestyle businesses on the Isle of Man are due to reopen next month, including restaurants with outdoor seating, hair salons and tattoo parlours. Once travel restrictions are lifted, Britons may wish to visit too – the Isle of Man, part of the Common Travel Area, will be exempt from the UK’s new quarantine policy. However, that could take some time. Only during the final phase of the island’s six-step reopening plan will border restrictions be lifted, and that will be dependent on the situation in the UK.Should we head there in any large number this summer, it wouldn’t be the first time. The Isle of Man was once the holiday destination of choice for countless Britons. Talk about stating the bleeding obvious...With Italy hoping to welcome foreign tourists from early next month, the archaeological site of Pompeii has reopened to the public for the first time since March. From today, visitors will be able to walk a specific route through the ruins. They must book a time slot online and only 40 people will be permitted to visit every 15 minutes. All visitors must pass through thermal scanners and are obliged to wear masks. Social distancing must also be maintained. On the plus side, tickets have been reduced to €5 until June 9, when the while site will reopen. The ruins reopened this morningLatam Airlines, South America\u0027s biggest carrier, has filed for bankruptcy as it battles to survive the Covid-19 crisis. Passenger and cargo flights will continue to operate, and employees will still be paid.

Rob Crossan is confused:It would normally require the illogicality of a Kafka novel combined with the surrealism of a Magritte painting to be in a situation where a citizen of Normandy would find it quicker and easier to get to Dubrovnik than to Dover. But, of course, as Franz Kafka knew only too well, there are ‘facts’, and then there are facts. And, in the midst of the whirling dervish of science, rumour, fear and mis-trust that roars around the margins of Covid-19, nothing, not even summer holidays, are spared the torture of this potentially ruinous confusion.The science that much of the rest of Europe is adhering to when it comes to the easing of travel restrictions is being wilfully ignored by the UK. Just as Italy, Spain, Greece and Iceland are lifting their borders, we’re shutting them ever tighter.While Britons are still not allowed to pitch a tent in an empty field, Iceland reopened its nightclub and gyms yesterday and gave the all-clear for public gatherings of up to 200 people.Iceland started lifting restrictions in early May, allowing hair salons, museums and schools to reopen, after the country\u0027s chief epidemiologist said its outbreak was past its peak. No rise in infections has subsequently been reported. Everyone arriving in Iceland from abroad is currently required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival, but the country\u0027s government says it intends to ease restrictions on international visitors by June 15 at the latest.Spain will welcome foreign tourists back to the country from July 1, ending its two-week quarantine policy, and the move has been welcomed by Europe\u0027s biggest low-cost airline.Ryanair\u0027s CEO Eddie Wilson said: After four months of lockdown, we welcome moves by governments in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus to open their borders, remove travel restrictions and scrap ineffective quarantines. Ryanair will be offering up to 1,000 daily flights from July 1. All will operate with new health guidelines in place, which will require all passengers to wear face masks in the airport and on board aircraft.Despite a few reports of rowdiness on the Kent coast, the vast majority of Britons appear to have enjoyed an incident-free bank holiday weekend in the sun.

Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies head, said the virus could “jump up at any time” even in countries where infections have been falling.Meanwhile, the a clinical trial into a malaria drug touted by Donald Trump as a Covid-19 preventative has been halted over safety fears. The WHO said testings involving hydroxychloroquine had been suspended while “data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDeaths in England and Wales\u0026nbsppass 40,000Minister resigns in protest over Dominic Cummings lockdown breachCountries lifting lockdowns could face \u0027immediate second peak\u0027 in infectionsSpanish death toll reaches 27,000Spain\u0027s Health Ministry reported\u0026nbspthat a total of 27,119 people had died from the coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak.Confirmed cases of the virus reached 236,259, the ministry said.Today, the government revised down the country\u0027s cumulative death toll by nearly 2,000 after checking data provided by regions, a move which drew sharp criticism from political opponents.\u0026nbspAround 90 5G masts attacked during lockdownThe number of attacks on mobile phone masts has climbed to around 90 since the coronavirus lockdown began, the UK\u0027s network trade body has revealed.MobileUK said it has currently recorded 87 arson incidents against network towers across the country, but warned there might be a delay on information from over the bank holiday weekend.Attacks against mobile masts have surged since March amid conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to the spread of Covid-19, a claim experts and scientists have called unproven, baseless and utter rubbish.One attack reported in April was on a mast serving the Nightingale hospital in Birmingham.Theories being spread about 5G are baseless and are not grounded in credible scientific theory, Mobile UK has repeatedly argued.Mobile operators are dedicated to keeping the UK connected, and careless talk could cause untold damage.Continuing attacks on mobile infrastructure risks lives and at this challenging time the UK\u0027s critical sectors must be able to focus all their efforts fighting this pandemic.Coronavirus \u0027disastrous\u0027 for children\u0027s rightsMeasures to taken by governments to curb the outbreak of coronavirus have had a disastrous impact on many children, a report has warned.School closures affecting\u0026nbsp1.5 billion children across 188 countries have left\u0026nbspboys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, child marriage,\u0026nbspteenage pregnancy, and domestic violence, according to the NGO Kids Right.It also warns unprecedented pressure on healthcare has shut down regular vaccination programmes\u0026nbspsuch as polio and measles and will cause a spike of hundreds of thousands in additional infant mortality.The United Nations estimates that an extra 42 to 66 million children could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis this year, the report notes.Scottish Tory leader calls for resignation of Dominic CummingsThe leader of the Scottish Conservative Party Jackson Carlaw has called on Boris Johnson’s under-pressure advisor Dominic Cummings to resign.The MSP said the scandal over the strategist’s trip from London to Durham during the lockdown was proving too much of a distraction.Carlaw said he had made his view that\u0026nbspCummings should “consider his position” known to Downing Street, according to both the BBC and STV.It\u0026nbspfollows the resignation of Douglas Ross, the Under Secretary of State for Scotland, from the government over the issue earlier today.No reason to keep Swedes out when Nordic neighbours reopen borders, insists minister\u0026nbspExcluding Sweden from moves to open borders across the Nordic region as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic would be a political decision and not justifiable on health grounds, the country\u0027s foreign\u0026nbspAnn Linde has said.With many European countries looking to ease travel restrictions ahead of the summer, there are concerns elsewhere in the Nordic region that allowing Swedish tourists in could increase the risk of new infections.Sweden has not imposed a sweeping lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus, and\u0026nbsphe country\u0027s death toll of 4,000 is\u0026nbspnearly four times the combined total of the other Nordic countries.Swedish media has raised concerns that the country\u0026nbspcould be excluded as curbs on travel are relaxed, both in the Nordic region and elsewhere in Europe.It is a very complicated issue, and I think that all politicians in every country should also look at the long term effect before they take very politically motivated decisions, Linde said.Uber cuts 600 jobs in IndiaUber has cut about 600 jobs in India as part of plans to reduce its global workforce by 23 per cent, the company has said, joining local rival Ola as the Covid-19 pandemic crushes demand for app-based cab services.Last week, Uber said it would focus on its core businesses in ride-hailing and food delivery and cut staffing globally in an attempt to become profitable despite the coronavirus pandemic.The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber India SA with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce, Uber India and South Asia president Pradeep Parameswaran said.Laid off employees will receive a minimum of 10 weeks\u0027\u0026nbspworth of payout, medical insurance coverage for the next six months and other help, Mr Parameswaran added.The ride-hailing taxi business in India came to a halt in late March as the government enforced a countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since been eased, but companies across sectors face challenges as demand for their services has dropped.South Korea reports 19 new cases on day before children return to schooolSouth Korea has reported 19 new coronavirus cases on the eve of the return to school for more than 2 million children.The majority of the new cases were in the Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been actively tracing transmissions linked to nightclubs and other entertainment venues.South Korea\u0027s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention also reported two more deaths, bringing the country\u0027s total to 269 fatalities from 11,225 cases.Wednesday will see around 2.4 million pupils return to school, and health minister Park Neung-hoo urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures.A new law has come into force in South Korea requiring people to wear masks on public transport and while using taxis.Spain to seek highest amount of coronavirus emergency funds possibleSpain will seek the highest amount possible in transfers from the European Union\u0027s coronavirus emergency funds, government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero has said.We will keep fighting so that the transfers are the largest possible and so it doesn\u0027t mean debt for Spain\u0027s government, she told a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting.The European Commission will propose on Wednesday its blueprint for the 27-nation bloc\u0027s budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework and worth around a trillion euros, and the accompanying coronavirus Recovery Fund.China to step up military preparedness amid coronavirus pandemicChina\u0027s president. Xi Jinping, has said his nation\u0026nbspwould step up its preparedness for armed combat and improve its ability to carry out military tasks as the coronavirus pandemic is having a profound impact on national security, state television reported.China\u0027s performance in fighting the new coronavirus has shown the success of military reform, Mr Xi was quoted as saying, adding that the armed forces should explore new ways of training amid the pandemic.Mr Xi, who chairs China\u0027s Central Military Commission, made the comments when attending a plenary meeting of the delegation of the People\u0027s Liberation Army and People\u0027s Armed Police Force on the sidelines of the annual session of parliament.Restrict access to coast until lifeguard\u0026nbsppatrols return, government toldThe chief executive of the RNLI has called on the UK government to restrict access to the coast until lifeguard patrols are back on beaches.Mark Dowie issued an open letter following the deaths of two people - including a 17-year-old girl - in separate incidents along the Cornish coastline on Monday.With thousands flocking to English beaches now lockdown restrictions have been eased, we must choose between keeping the public or our lifeguards safe, Mr Dowie wrote.Safety advice and warnings will only go so far when people are desperate to enjoy some freedom after weeks of lockdown.As a lifesaving charity, the RNLI cannot stop people going to beaches - but the government can - before more lives are lost around our coast this summer.JK Rowling to publish fairy tale for children in lockdownJK Rowling will publish a fairy tale called The Ickabog\u0026nbspfree online so that children on lockdown can read it, with the first chapter to be published today.Over 10 years ago, I wrote a stand-alone fairy tale called The Ickabog, Rowling said. Until very recently, the only people whoâd heard the story of The Ickabog were my two younger children.The Harry Potter author said the mostly handwritten manuscript had been stored in her attic until a few weeks ago. She said she had done some rewriting in recent weeks.Iâve decided to publish The Ickabog for free online, so children on lockdown, or even those back at school during these strange, unsettling times, can read it or have it read to them, she said.Spain declares 10 days of mourningThe Spanish government has\u0026nbspdeclared\u0026nbsp10 days of\u0026nbspmourning\u0026nbspfrom tomorrow to honour the nearly 30,000 people who died from the coronavirus pandemic in one of the world\u0027s worst-hit countries.During the mourning period, flags will fly at half-mast all over the country\u0027s public buildings and navy ships, government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero told a briefing after a cabinet meeting today.The period will end with an official ceremony led by the head of state in remembrance of the 26,834 fatalities recorded in the country.Spain has reported a total of 235,400 confirmed cases of the disease.Portugal and UK in talks over tourism\u0026nbsp\u0027air bridge\u0027Portugal and the UK are in talks over a potential\u0026nbspair bridge\u0026nbspfor tourists that would allow British visitors\u0026nbspto avoid two weeks of quarantine upon arriving back in the UK, Reuters is reporting.Portugal\u0027s tourism-dependent economy has been hard hit by the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns at home and abroad, and authorities are trying to save at least part of the crucial summer season.The UK is the leading source of tourism for Portugal and is introducing a 14-day quarantine order for travellers arriving from abroad - including Britons arriving from overseas -\u0026nbspfrom 8 June.Reuters cited two Portuguese sources, who said the talks with the UK were at an early stage.Portugal\u0027s death toll of 1,330 and total cases at 30,788 are just a fraction of neighbouring Spain, where\u0026nbsp27,000 people have died\u0026nbspand more than 235,000 have been infected.India reports record jump in cases for seventh dayFor a seventh consecutive day, India has reported its biggest jump in coronavirus cases.The country\u0027s health ministry today confirmed 145,380 new infections, an increase of 6,535 from the day before, and 4,167 deaths.But officials\u0026nbspsaid the recovery rate had also risen above 40 per cent.Most of the cases are concentrated in two neighbouring states in central India, Maharashtra, home to financial hub Mumbai, and Gujarat, prime minister Narendra Modi\u0027s home state.An uptick in cases has also been reported in some of India\u0027s poorest eastern states as migrant workers returning to native villages from\u0026nbspcities have begun arriving home on special trains.India\u0027s virus caseload has been climbing as\u0026nbsplockdown restrictions have eased. Domestic flights resumed on Monday after a two-month hiatus, though at a fraction of normal capacity.Montenegro to open borders after declaring itself virus-freeMontenegro, the first\u0026nbspEuropean country to declare itself free of\u0026nbspcoronavirus infections, is to open its borders to citizens of some\u0026nbspEuropean countries - but not its neighbour and former ally Serbia.Dusko Markovic, Montenegro\u0027s prime minister, said the\u0026nbspborders would be opened from 1\u0026nbspJune\u0026nbspfor nationals of the countries that have no more more than 25 Covid-19 patients per 100,000 population.He said Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Albania and Greece met that criteria, set by Montenegrin health officials.Mr Markovic did not mention neighbouring Serbia, triggering an angry rebuke from Belgrade despite Serbia not meeting the criteria.Thailand extends emergency powersThailand\u0027s cabinet has\u0026nbspextended an emergency decree to fight the coronavirus to 30 June, with a government spokeswoman denying opposition suggestions that the country\u0027s prime minister\u0026nbspis seeking a return to unchecked powers.The state of emergency was first declared in late March came against the backdrop of student protests against the banning of a party opposed to prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.With new cases now dwindling, some opposition figures have suggested the emergency decree should be allowed to expire.The prime minister would like to say that since the beginning of the emergency decree\u0027s usage and every extension, we have based this on public health reasons and not political ones, government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat said after a cabinet meeting today.Thailand was the first country outside to China to report a case of coronavirus, on 13 January.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rocket and capsule that will carry the astronauts has been built by Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, and the mission represents the final test of both.Nasa and SpaceX launch could be delayed by weatherIt will also be the first time a private company has attempted to send astronauts into space.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about this mission, which will launch at 9.30pm UK time.The mission, known as Demo-2, will allow the US to once again send humans into space.According to Nasa, this is a demonstration mission to show SpaceX\u0027s ability to ferry astronauts to the space station and back safely.It is the final major step required by SpaceX\u0027s astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, to get certified by Nasa\u0027s Commercial Crew Programme for more long-term manned missions to space.Mr Behnken, 48, and Mr Hurley, 53, are experienced Nasa astronauts who have been involved in testing of the Crew Dragon capsule.Mr Hurley, who was a fighter pilot in the US Marine Corps, was on the final flight of the space shuttle Atlantis in 2011 before it was discontinued.Mr Behnken was a flight test engineer with the US Air Force before joining Nasa, and has spent just over 29 days in space, which includes 37 hours of spacewalking time.He will serve as the mission\u0027s joint operations commander and take responsibility for the rendezvous, docking and undocking of the Dragon capsule, while Mr Hurley will be in charge of the launch, landing and recovery of the vehicle in his role as the Crew Dragon spacecraft commander.The two men will be wearing spacesuits designed by SpaceX with help from Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez.The Falcon 9 rocket will take off from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley strapped inside.Shortly after lift-off, the rocket will separate into what is called a first stage and a second stage.The first stage will return to a SpaceX landing ship which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida, while the second part of the rocket continue the journey with the Crew Dragon.Once in orbit, the Crew Dragon will then separate from the second stage and travel at around 17,000mph before being in a position to rendezvous, and dock, with the space station 24 hours later.Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley will test the Crew Dragon\u0027s environmental control system, the displays and controls, and the manoeuvring thrusters.They will also monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station, according to Nasa.The duo will become members of the Expedition 63 crew and perform further tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station.But the pair\u0027s main mission is to conclude the validation process that is required by Nasa to ensure the spacecraft designed to carry astronauts can operate safely.The Demo-2 mission is expected to last anything between one and four months. But Nasa said the duration of this mission would be determined by when the next commercial crew will be able to travel to the space station.The spacecraft will be capable of staying in orbit for at least 210 days.When it is time to return, the Crew Dragon will autonomously undock with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley on board and depart the space station.Shortly after firing up its engines to re-enter the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, the spacecraft will deploy four parachutes to slow its descent and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.SpaceX\u0027s recovery ship, called Go Navigator, will be waiting nearby to retrieve the duo and ferry them to Cape Canaveral.In 2010, the US started to wind down its space shuttle programme which had carried astronauts into orbit for three decades with the aim of focusing on building technology for Moon and Mars missions.Nasa asked private companies such as Space X and Boeing to design the technologies which would allow passengers to travel to space, while opting to pay Russia to send American astronauts to the space station as an interim arrangement.If Demo-2 is successful, SpaceX will be allowed to go ahead with more manned missions to the space stations as part of their 2.6 billion US dollar (£2.1 billion) contract with Nasa.Boeing also has a similar deal with the space agency, worth 4.2 billion US dollars (£3.4 billion), to send astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, although its vehicle is not expected to be ready until next year.Both Nasa and SpaceX will be hosting live streams of the events, which will begin a few hours before launch. Tune in earlier to get a look at the astronauts as they are driven to the spacecraft before they set off, as well as for discussions about the mission with experts.Nasa\u0027s live coverage will be hosted on Nasa TV, which can be watched here, via YouTube, as well as on the space agency\u0027s official site:SpaceX\u0027s coverage will be hosted on its own website too, on a launch page that currently gives a full rundown of how the day will play out.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will be the first time astronauts launch from Florida in nine years and a first for a private company.The manager of NASA\u0027s commercial crew program, Kathy Lueders, said everything was progressing well — at least on the ground.SpaceX gets go-ahead for Nasa astronaut launch next weekNow the only thing we need to do is figure out how to control the weather, she said Monday evening as rain continued to drench the area. We\u0027re continuing to be vigilant and careful and make sure we do this right.The Dragon\u0027s emergency escape system can kick in, if necessary, all the way to orbit. If that happens, the capsule will need relatively calm wind and seas in which to splash down.SpaceX will have at least two recovery ships deployed off Florida, and NASA will have two military cargo planes ready to take off. Additional planes will be stationed in New York and England to assist with a potential water rescue, according to Lueders.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This includes the belief that opposition to the government operate in “deep state” which works to undermine him.The conspiracy is also linked to the unfounded \u0027Pizzagate\u0027 conspiracy from 2016, which claimed that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among other members of the US establishment, was involved in an apparent child abuse ring.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesQAnon believers have had their own lawyers argue that belief in the conspiracy proves they are insane, and have climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge to spread the ideology. The FBI has stated that QAnon is a potential domestic terrorist threat. As reported by Media Matters, a not-for-profit progressive research centre, which brought the applications’ violations of Google policies to the search giant’s attention, QMAP, Q Alerts!, and Q Alerts LITE were removed from the Android store. Google’s privacy policy states that apps which have “content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks” are forbidden.The origins of the huge, bizarre \u0027QAnon\u0027 theory spreading onlineA Google spokesperson said in a statement that:  “When we find apps that violate Play policy by distributing misleading or harmful information, we remove them from the store.”It is unclear how many people downloaded the applications, or whether Google profited from any microtransactions or other payments made by people through the app. Google takes a 30 percent cut of all payments made through in-app purchases on its store. We have reached out to the company for clarification.The QAnon conspiracy theories have also interlinked with false beliefs about the coronavirus with some suggesting that the disease is a cover so Trump can secretly arrest ‘deep state agents’ while others believe that COVID-19 is part of “spiritual warfare” where only those chosen by God will not be affected.Google has had to take action against coronavirus misinformation too, working with the NHS as well as Facebook and Twitter to crack down on hoaxes.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emergency funding should go to areas with the highest rates of infection.”Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, said its authorities believed ministers had “pulled the rug from under them”, after promising they would receive “whatever it takes”.“Now it’s ‘take whatever you are given’ and it’s noticeable that it’s Labour areas that have missed out in the second tranche,” he protested.This NHS U-turn shows we must not question supporting immigrantsSignificant numbers of government’s coronavirus home tests never usedMore than a fifth of people believe coronavirus is a hoaxContact tracing app shares private date with outside firm“It is disgraceful if funding is being allocated in that partisan way, after what ministers said about putting away party-political squabbles in a time of national crisis.”In total, more than £100m was erted from councils in the bottom half of the deprivation index, when £1.6bn of emergency grants were announced in late April, according to the Labour analysis.That is the difference from the allocations to each town hall from the first £1.6bn pot, handed out in March, which did include deprivation in the weightings.The second £1.6bn tranche was awarded on a per-capita basis, raising fears in town halls – which still face an estimated £10bn black hole because of coronavirus costs – that the method will be used for future allocations.The future downgrading of deprivation was signalled in the so-called fair funding review which began under Theresa May and triggered loud protests.However, it is supposed to be on hold, until April 2022, after poorer areas that delivered Boris Johnson’s general election triumph were among those facing big cuts.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We’re providing councils with an unprecedented £3.2bn in the fairest way possible and giving them the resources to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they’re facing.“The two tranches of funding were allocated in different ways because they address different needs, but should be considered together as the true picture of this additional support.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo 10 have said the visit he made to Durham was  “essential”. In the first official comment since it emerged that the prime minister’s chief adviser had apparently flouted lockdown rules, Downing Street said his actions were “in line” with the guidelines. But the SNP have written to Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the Civil Service, calling for him to investigate both Mr Cummings’ trip and what was known about it in Downing Street.

Split into more than 80 wards containing 42 beds each, the facility will be used to treat Covid-19 patients who have been transferred from other intensive care units across London. Defending Mr Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said:  “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected Coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”Members of the cabinet also defended Mr Cummings.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, wrote in a similar vein: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with Coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.”Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, added: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Opposition politicians have accused No 10 of a ‘cover up’ after reports some in Downing Street knew Mr Cummings had made the 260-mile journey during lockdown.Labour have called on Boris  Johnson to say whether or not he sanctioned the trip.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that Mr Johnson had questions to answer  and should fire his chief adviser immediately. Police have confirmed they visited a property in County Durham after Mr Cummings made the  trip from his London home.

He called on Mr Johnson to state publicly if he believed Mr Cummings had adhered to the rules. “It’s clearly a matter of public interest - lockdown has been heartbreaking for so many families,  this looks like one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for everyone else,” he said.  The details of Mr Cumming’s trip were revealed by the Daily Mirror and the . A neighbour told the papers Mr Cummings was seen in the garden, while Abba\u0027s Dancing Queen was playing loudly. Durham police confirmed officers had spoken to the owners of an address after reports a person had travelled there from London.A spokesman said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.Senior members of Mr Johnson’s own party expressed concern Mr Cumming’s journey could endanger the government’s plans to lift the lockdown. Former Tory cabinet minister  David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, told Newsnight: There\u0027s clearly serious questions that No 10 are going to have to address, not least because the readiness of members of the public to follow government guidance more generally is going to be affected by this sort of story.Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a government adviser for flouting the rules when he was visited at this home by his girlfriend. At the time Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was speechless and said he backed any police action against Mr Ferguson.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Cummings to quit over the allegations, while a spokesman for Labour said: The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.He told the BBC Mr Johnson had serious questions to answer. “Did he sanction this? Did he say “this is ok”?”Allies of Mr Cummings said he was  not “remotely bothered” by the story, calling it “fake news”.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have been fortunate not to have caught this awful virus but if we did, we are prepared to follow the government advice and stay at home to contain this virus.”Mr Ross accepted the senior adviser\u0027s intentions may have been well meaning but said the public reaction made it clear that his interpretation of the rules was not shared by the majority.Senior Scottish Conservatives broke ranks to raise their concerns over Mr Cummings, with Adam Tomkins, the shadow strategy secretary, saying it was clear that he should be sacked.It shows exactly why Cummings should be sacked.

A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson regrets\u0027\u0027 Mr Ross\u0027 decision to quit the government over the Mr Cummings row.The spokesman said: The prime minister would like to thank Douglas Ross for his service to government and regrets his decision to stand down as parliamentary under secretary of state for Scotland.\u0027\u0027 The shock resignation comes as the government was frantically battling to regain control of the narrative after the row over Mr Cummings\u0027 actions dominated the bank holiday weekend.The senior aide was forced to take part in an extraordinary press conference on Monday, where he said he had travelled to his parents home in Durham at the end of March after his wife Mary fell ill.They stayed in an isolated property on his father\u0027s farm, where the following day he woke up in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms.By April 11 he was still feeling weak and exhausted but had no coronavirus symptoms, so he considered returning to work. But as his eyesight had been affected by the disease, his wife did not want to risk the long drive back to London, so they went on a short drive to Barnard Castle.The family returned to London on 13 April, and he returned to work the next day, Mr Cummings said.Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, earlier defended Mr Cummings - a long-time ally - saying people will make their own mind up about his actions.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: What\u0027s clear is that he didn\u0027t break the law, he didn\u0027t break the rules, he sought to protect his family.And he also sought to ensure the risk of anyone in his family infecting anyone else was absolutely minimised.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At ShopRite, we continue to adhere to our sanitation and social distancing protocols to ensure our stores remain a safe place for associates and customers to work and shop,” the company told CBS News in a statement. “We are all in this together and we ask for everyone to be patient and understanding during this difficult time.”New York state, which became the epicentre of the epidemic in the US, has over 360,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of more than 23,000. More than 199,000 of the confirmed cases are in New York City, the hotbed of the outbreak.Gov Cuomo announced an “exciting new phase” in his reopening plans earlier this month saying parts of the state can begin to open on Friday in accordance with Centres for Disease Control guidelines.The number of new coronavirus cases per day in New York state is at the lowest they have been since the outbreak began, Gov Cuomo said on Friday.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers added that the tweets appeared to create ision in America on coronavirus, but that they could not confirm what iniduals or groups are behind the bot accounts.“We do know that it looks like it’s a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks, but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that,” said Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, last week.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Bot Twitter accounts also discussed 100 different false narratives on the coronavirus, including conspiracies surrounding 5G technology’s connection to Covid-19. At the same time, tweets about Donald Trump’s “reopening of America” were seen to contain conspiracies. The Carnegie Mellon scientists added that current bot activity on Covid-19 was almost double that predicted, based on previous elections and natural disasters. Ms Carley continued: “Because it’s global, it’s being used by various countries and interest groups as an opportunity to meet political agendas”. Researchers described Twitter bot actions as repetitive, and above what is thought to be practically possible for humans.  “People often refer to bots when describing everything from automated account activity to iniduals who would prefer to be anonymous for personal or safety reasons, or avoid a photo because they’ve got strong privacy concerns,” said Twitter in a statement to NPR. The social media platform also claims to have “challenged” 1.5 million accounts because of unusual activity on Covid-19, whilst deleting thousands of tweets. Russia denied allegations that it was spreading Covid-19 disinformation in the West in March, after the European Union warned in an internal document that the Kremlin wanted to “aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries”.

There is no mixing and they aren’t touching each other,” Laurent David, the headteacher of the school near Nantes, tells The Independent. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They aren’t wearing masks, but they are following the orders very well, like using hand gel.” The students – aged between five and 11 years old – are experiencing school during the time of coronavirus. ​Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?As countries hit by coronavirus start making the first steps back towards normal life, children are returning to the classroom and parents back to work.In England, schools have been told to prepare for certain years to come back from 1 June, with the aim of all primary schools students returning for a month before the summer – a move which has faced criticism from unions and councils over safety concerns. Meanwhile in France, which has also been badly-affected by Covid-19, children were allowed back to school last week.Mr David says the Ecole elementaire la Metairie started teaching pupils aged five to 11 in school again on 12 May.“In the morning, we are bringing in around half of these children,” he says. “And during the afternoon, we are looking after the children who have stayed at home by doing distance teaching.”However, he says schools were under no obligation to open, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie asked parents for their opinion first.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimilar to advice in England, schools have been told to limit class sizes to 15 children. This should be reduced to 10 for the youngest pupils in France. Although things have been going well, it gets much harder trying to get younger children to socially distance, Mr David explains. That is why lots of schools – including the preschool attached to his primary – have not yet brought children younger than five years old back into the classroom.He says other places have been bringing children back on alternate days, or even alternate weeks.“No school is working in the same way. The problem with making a six-year-old do a full day when they must stay at a table without moving around, is that becomes a very long day from them.”Mr David adds: “That makes teaching conditions very bad. Because of that, we decided to just open for mornings. It makes it easier, more effective for students, and more bearable.”However, he says it was difficult to balance the parents’ needs who were eager to return to work full time. He adds that schools have to follow health safety guidelines given to every headteacher, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie​ decided the best way they could open safely was to offer half days for now. Included in the guidelines is what to do if a child displays symptoms: call the parents straight away, and get them tested.Last Thursday, a child from the primary school near Nantes had to be taken home after falling ill and is waiting for their test results.“If it is really coronavirus, we may have to shut the school or send a class home,“We don’t have any problem doing that,” he adds.France allowed preschools and primary schools to reopen from the start of last week, with secondary schools allowed to gradually welcome students back from 18 May – although these older students must wear face masks. ‘I don’t know’: Minister admits schools reopening up in the airMinisters under pressure to scrap plans to open schools to more pupilsParents also have the right to keep their children at home if they wish.When asked what advice Mr David had for headteachers in England working to reopen schools next month, he says it is important to be “well-prepared”.“It took us two weeks to prepare properly,” he says, adding they were ready to open on the first day.“The most important thing is to make decisions as early as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Parents naturally worry their children are more vulnerable to any disease. It’s not so with coronavirus. Mums and dads should take confidence from that.And yet, defying the best impartial evidence available, the Left has terried Britain into a revolt. No, ing to school cannot be  per cent safe. What is, short of staying home forever hoping for a vaccine Meanwhile the lockdown damage to kids’ education, mental health and le chances is almost unimaginable.Corbynite NEU chief Mary Bousted cynically sneers: “It’s just descending into chaos now” before talking up the opposing claims of the so-called “Independent Sage Committee” and bemoaning the “confusion” for parents.Who caused this chaos and confusion  People like her. And this “Independent Sage Committee” is just a self-appointed club of hard-Left scientists motivated to sabotage the Brexit-backing Tories.Parents must not be taken in. The REAL Sage’s evidence is at least arrived at in good faith, not via political bias. Too many unprincipled Labour MPs are willing on these union wreckers.Aren’t they meant to be a more grown-up outfit now  So much for that.IT is good to see the PFA supporting seven gay footballers, two in the Premier League, who are too fearful of a public backlash to come out.We totally sympathise.But Covid gives them a unique breathing space to do so.There will be no barracking in empty stadiums. Social media can be ignored. And . per cent of the public won’t care or will applaud their courage.By the time football s in full, their sexuality will be old news — and any abusive bigot will get short shrt.Homophobia will be history one day.

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands. Our national security lies in ours.We all hope China will make the necessary reforms and take the right path.But hope is not a good basis for foreign policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By doing this he has left himself open to claims that he behaves asthere is one law for him and one law for the rest of us.But his case is very dferent to those of Professor Neil Ferguson and Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, who both resigned after breaking lockdown.Professor Ferguson went to visit his married lover and Dr Calderwood enjoyed a break at her holiday home.Mr Cummings travelled to isolate himself and ensure the protection of his young son.

He has been proved right.“The problem with epidemiologists is that they feel their job is to frighten people into lockdown,” says Levitt. “I think lockdown saved no lives.”Indeed, this outbreak of ­coronavirus does not even rate officially as an epidemic.Just as many died in  from severe winter flu. Back then, images of patients ­queuing on hospital trolleys or parked in ­ambulances aroused routine media interest.Lockdown was never even considered.All deaths are tragic for those who go before their time.Butthere is another ­outbreak this winter, would we shut down the entire economy again  No way.So why did we take such draconian action this time It was to save the NHS, which had been left ­unprepared by its managers.We’ve now done that. Hospitals are back to normal. Death rates are falling. There is no sign of a second wave, whether we lt lockdown or not.The NHS has coped brilliantly thanks to frontline staff, not its leaden-footed, box­ticking bureaucratic bosses.Our Thursday night salutes have done their job and — as their cheerleader suggests — should be wound up this week.This freak ten-week spring Bank Holiday is over.It’s time for classrooms to resume, shops to reopen and pubs and theatres to begin cheering us up again.Let’s keep washing our hands and elbow bumping, but two-metre distancing is just another form of lockdown.Let’s make it one metre, as the World Health Organisation suggests.Britain will bounce back swtly in a V-shaped recovery — rather than crashing ­vertically over the edge of that wretched clf.DEFIANT Boris Johnson did more than simply ride to the rescue of embattled Dominic Cummings yesterday.

But he or his Chancellor must also now warn the nation directly about the horric consequencesBritain cannot rapidly be weaned off it.It is disturbing to see that the public, which dutully adopted these curbs to protect lives and the NHS, has grown addicted to them. Public sector workers reckon they are better off furloughed. Plenty in the private sector do too.Many parents, despite official scientic advice saying it is safe, say they will refuse totheir kids to school even though the PM has announced the first welcome reopenings on June  .Most people think the economy will right itself in a year or two and few seem bothered.They are more fixated on the furore over whether Dominic Cummings bent the lockdown rules to look after his child than with the looming catastrophe unless they are soon lted.This suicidal delusion is the result of a highly effective Government campaign about the Covid- threat, combined with generous bailouts, a promise of no new austerity and some great weather.Millions, including many Sun readers, have worked through the crisis. Millions more are itching to go back.Too many others, though, have been lulled into a disastrous  sense of security.We face an unprecedented recession. The economy has imploded.The Government had to borrow £billion in April, not far off half what Labour borrowed in a YEAR during the global financial crisis, leading to a decade of austerity.The initial trickle of job losses is already a flood and will soon be a tsunami.It falls to the PM or Rishi Sunak to explain to the nation in the starkest terms that unless we swtlyto near-normality, with public opinion onside, millions may never have a job toto. That this colossal new debt will take a generation to pay off.When the bailouts end and hardship bites, those who backed endless lockdown will not rue their own complacency. They will blame the Tories who failed to warn them how bad it would get.The Government also needs far more urgency over reopening shops, restaurants, pubs and travel — with social distancing — and a more realistic assessment of the tiny Covid risk to most people.The daily death toll, as heartbreaking as it still is, is falling fast. So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places.

The PM said Britain will be easing the lockdown and moving to “step two”.British teaching unions have urged the Government to reconsider its plans to reopen schools for younger pupils.Sir Keir Starmer has called for schools to reopen as soon as possible and pleaded with unions, parents and government officials to work together.The new leader of the Labour party also revealed his children have attended school throughout the coronavirus pandemic.It comes less than a week on from a bombshell report by the governments top scientists warning lockdown has caused a shock to kids and will affect work opportunities for the rest of their lives.Downing Street published the findings from SAGE in a move to reassure worried parents and teachers about its plan to re-open schools on June .The documents - which also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was much lower than adults - were released as militant teaching unions and councils prepared to defy the government and refuse to go back.Only a handful of councils plan to reopen schools on June , leaving parents across the country in the dark over their childrens education.The final decision on whether or not to open up classrooms will fall to headteachers and teaching unions. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings thought right detailed statement defending","story":"In a detailed statement, the Prime Minister’s top aide said he acted reasonably and did what he thought was right over fears about a lack of childcare,he became incapacitated with Covid-.Mr Cummings also said he made the journey over concerns about his familys safety after being subjected to threats of violence.Speaking in the rose garden of Downing Street, he denied further reports which suggested he took a second trip to the North East on April .He revealed that his four-year-old son had been taken to hospital while he was self-isolating at his familys farm in Durham.The Prime Ministers aide explained he decided to take his family to Durham when his we became ill because there were no child care options in London.Good afternoon, thank you for coming. Yesterday I gave a full account to the Prime Minister of my actions between the th of March and the th of April, what I thought and did.He has asked me to repeat that account directly to you.I know that millions of people in this country are angry, thousands have died, many are angry about what they have seen in the media about my actions. I want to clear up the confusions and misunderstandings that I can.In retrospect I should have made the statement earlier. Its many years since I have said anything on television, but Ill do my best to answer questions after Ive explained what happened.I also should clary that Im not here to speak on behalf of the Government or the Prime Minister, Im explaining my own actions and my own thinking.The Prime Minister is giving a press conference later and he will answer questions on Government policy.Around midnight on Thursday, the th of March, I spoke to the prime minister. He told me that he tested positive for Covid. We discussed the national emergency arrangements for No., given his isolation and what I would do in No.  the next day.The next morning, I went to work as usual. I was in a succession of meetings about this emergency.I suddenly got a call from my we who was at home looking after our four year old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill. Shed vomited and felt like she might pass out. And therell be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available. They were alone in the house.After very briefly telling some officials in No. what had happened, I immediately left the building, ran to a car and drove home. This was reported by the media at the time who saw me run out of No. . After a couple of hours, my we felt a bit better. There were many critical things at work and she urged me toin the afternoon and I did.That evening, I ed home and discussed the situation with my we. She was ill. She might have Covid, though she did not have a cough or a fever. At this point, most of those who I work with most closely, including the prime minister himself and others who sit within  feet of me every day, either had had symptoms and had ed to work or were absent with symptoms. I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.I had a few conflicting thoughts in my mind. First, I was worried thatmy we and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child and exposed themselves to Covid. My we had felt on the edge of not being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier. I was thinking, whatthe same or worse happens to me  Theres nobody here that I can reasonably ask to help. The regulations make clear, I believe the risks to the health of a small child were an exceptional situation, and I had a way of dealing with this that minimised risk to others.Second, I thought thatI did not develop symptoms, then I might be able toto work to help deal with the crisis. There were ongoing discussions about testing government staff in order to keep people like me working rather than isolating. At this point, on the Friday, advisers such as myself had not been included in the list of who were tested. But it was possible that this might change the following week. Therefore, I thought that after testing negative, I could continue working.In fact, this did not change and special advisers were not tested and I have never been tested. Third, there had been numerous  stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid. In particular, there were stories suggesting that I had opposed lockdown and even then I did not care about many deaths. For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning. The truth is, that I had argued for lockdown. I did not oppose it. But these stories had created a very bad atmosphere around my home. I was subject to threats of violence. People came to my house shouting threats.There were posts on social media, encouraging attacks. There were many media reports on TV showing pictures of my house. I was also worried that given the severity of this emergency, this situation would get worse. And I was worried about the possibility of leaving my we and child at home all day and off into the night while I worked in No.. I thought the best thing to do in all the circumstances was to drive to an isolated cottage on my fathers farm. At this farm, my parents live in one house.My sister and her two children live in another house, and there was a separate cottage roughly  metres away from either of them. My tentative conclusion on the Friday evening was this:we are both unable to look after our child, then my sister or nieces can look after him. My nieces are  and . They are old enough to look after him, but also young enough to be in the safest category. And they had extremely kindly volunteered to do soneeded.But, I thought,I do not develop symptoms and there is a testing regime in place at work, I couldto workI tested negative. In that situation, I could leave my we and child behind in a safe place, safe in the form of support from family for shopping in emergencies, safe in the sense of being away from home which had become a target and also safe for everybody  because they were completely isolated on a farm and could not infect anybody.Contrary to some media reports, there are no neighbours in the normal sense of the word. The nearest other homes are roughly half a mile away. So in this scenario, I thought that they could stay there for a few weeks. I could go back to work, help colleagues and everybody, including the general public, would be safe.I did not ask the prime minister about this decision. He was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with. Everyday, I have to exercise my judgement about things like this and decide what to discuss with him. I thought I would speak to him when the situation claried over coming days, including whether I had symptoms and whether there were tests available.Arguably, this was a mistake, and I understand that some will say that I shouldve spoken to the prime minister before deciding what to do. So I drove the three of us up to Durham last night, arriving roughly at midnight. I did not stop on the way. When I worked the next morning, Saturday the th of March, I was in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever.Clearly, I could notto work any time soon. For a day or two, we were both ill. I was in bed. My we was ill, but not ill enough that she needed emergency help. I got worse. She got better. During the night of Thursday, the nd of April, my child woke up. He threw up and had a bad fever. He was very distressed. We took medical advice which was to call . An ambulance was sent, they assessed my child and said he must go to hospital.I could barely stand up. My we went with him in the ambulance. I stayed at home. He stayed the night in the hospital. In the morning, my we called to say that he had recovered, seemed back to normal. Doctors had tested him for Covid and said that they shouldhome. There were no taxis. I drove to the hospital, picked them up, then ed home.I did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody at any point on this short trip. The hospitals, I dont know what, roughly five miles or something away two miles, three miles four miles, something like that. A few days later, the hospital said that he tested negative. After I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house.At one point the three of us walked into woods owned by my father, next to the cottage that I was staying in. Some people saw us in these woods from a distance, but we had no interaction with them. We had not left the property. We were on private land. By Saturday, the th of April, I was still feeling weak and exhausted. But other than that, I had no Covid symptoms. I thought that Id be able toto work the following week, possibly part time.It was obvious that the situation was extremely serious. The Prime Minister had been gravely ill. Colleagues were dealing with huge problems and many were ill or isolating. I felt like I ought toto workpossible, given I was now recovering in order to relieve the intense strain at No. . That Saturday, I sought expert medical advice. I explained our familys symptoms and all the timings, and I askedit was safe toto work on Monday, Tuesday, seek child care and so on. I was told that it was safe and I couldto work and seek childcare.On Sunday  April,  days after I had first displayed symptoms, I decided toto work. My we was very worried, particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She didnt want to risk a nearly -mile drive with our child, given how ill I had been. We agreed that we should go for a short drive to seeI could drive safely. We drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town.We did not visit the castle. We did not walk around the town. We parked by a river. My we and I discussed the situation. We agreed that I could drive safely, we should turn around, go home. I felt a bit sick. We walked about  to  metres from the car to the river bank nearby. We sat there for about  minutes. We had no interactions with anybody. I felt better. We ed the car. An elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My we wished him Happy Easter from a distance, but we had no other interaction.We headed home. On the way home, our child needed the toilet. He was in the back seat of the car. We pulled over to the side of the road, my we and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road. They were briefly outside. I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit and then I got out of the car, went outside. We were briefly in the woods. We saw some people at a distance. But at no point did we break any social distancing rules. We then got back in the car and went home.We agreed thatI continued to improve then the next day, we shouldto London and I would go back to work. We ed to London on the evening of Monday  April, Easter Monday. I went back to work in No.  the next morning. At no point between arriving and leaving Durham did any of the three of us enter my parents house or my sisters house. Our only exchanges were shouted conversations at a distance. My sister shopped for us and left everything outside.In the last few days, there have been many media reports that I ed to Durham after  April. All these stories are . There is a particular report that I ed there on  April. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . And local CCTV,it exists, would also prove that Im telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.During this two-week period, my mothers brother died with Covid. There are media reports that this had some influence on my behaviour. These reports . This private matter did not affect my movements. None of us saw him. None of us attended his funeral. In this very complex situation, I tried to exercise my judgement the best I could.I believe that in all circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in No. and the public interest in effective government to which I could contribute.I was involved in decisions affecting millions of people, and I thought that I should try to help as much as I could do. I can understand that some people will argue that I should have stayed at my home in London throughout.I understand these views. I know the intense hardship and sacrice that the entire country has had to go through. However, I respectfully disagree. The legal rules inevitably do not cover all circumstances, including those that I found myself in. I thought and I think today that the rules, including those regarding small children in extreme circumstances, allowed me to exercise my judgement about the situation I found myself in, including the way that my London home had become a target and all the complexity of the situation.I accept, of course, that there is room for reasonable disagreement about this. I could also understand some people think I should not have driven at all anywhere.But I had taken medical expert medical advice. It was  days after symptoms. Id been told that I couldto work and employ childcare. I think it was reasonable and sensible to make a short journey before embarking on a five-hour drive to see whether I was in a fit state to do this. The alternative was to stay in Durham rather than going back to work and contributing to the governments efforts. I believe I made the right judgment, though I can understand that others may disagree with that.Ive explained all of the above to the Prime Minister. At some point during the first week where we were both sick and in bed, I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly, given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail. I did not make my movements public at the time because my London home was already a target. I did not believe that I was obliged to make my parents and my sisters home a target for harassment as well.I understand that millions of people have seen media coverage of this issue. I know that millions have endured awful hardship, including personal tragedies, over the past few months, and people are suffering every day. And I know the British people hate the idea of unfairness. I wanted to explain what I thought, what I did and why, over this period, because I think that people like me who helped to make the rules should be accountable for their actions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The audience was tobacco buyers and not consumers.Theres a greater risk of progressing to regular smoking and nicotine dependence for those who start on menthols compared to those puffing on plain versions.Young people are more likely to get hooked as menthol makes it easier to inhale the smoke into the lungs by creating a sweeter, milder, or “colder” smoke and by reducing its harshness.These flavoured fags have been banned in the UK under EU laws which still apply during the Brexit transition.The legislation stems from the EU Tobacco Products Directive .This tough rule has been transposed into UK law, and will remain in force after the end of the transition period for leaving the EU comes to an end on December , .The products are being sold under the “menthol reimagined logo” and could take in some of the revenue from the £. billion-a-year UK market.An online training course seen by The Sun shows how JTI is marketing the new products.Sterling New Superkings Green are the new products and are the same as Sterling Superkings Green, while the latest version from Benson  Hedges is Benson  Hedges New Superkings Green, which had been Benson  Hedges Superkings Blue Dual.The ban was supposed to have been on cigarettes with a characterising flavour such as menthol products, the new blend however smells and tastes like menthol, but does not actually contain it.Speaking to the Daily Mail, Conservative MP Rob Blackman said the company was “cynically trying to circumvent a very sensible ban on cigarettes which are intended to make you quickly addicted to nicotine and a customer for le.“There are literally thousands of young people who get addicted to nicotine through menthol cigarettes. That was the point of the ban. This shows you cant trust big tobacco.”Customers on social media claimed they were still able to get menthol products despite the ban having been implemented.Some said the Sterling New Dual, were a blend of product and meant they could still get the menthol taste.The legislation put in place by the government is part of a push for a smoke-free society by .The move from JTI comes after rival group Philip Morris promoted a menthol heated-tobacco stick.Philip Morris are said to have described the UKs ban as a huge opportunity for the market and have even hired new staff to help push the new products.An investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that the company had promoted menthol kits and trials for new customers.These included half-price tobacco sticks, that included four menthol flavours.Ms Arnott added: ASH has written to the Government to ask for an investigation into these new cigarettes which Japan Tobacco International say contain a special tobacco blend which tastes like menthol. If this required the addition of any ingredient other than tobacco, then these products are illegal.If they are made of a magical tobacco blend that tastes like menthol, then JTI may have obeyed the letter of the law but in no way, shape or form is the company following its spirit.”In a statement, a spokesperson for JTI said: JTI products always comply with all relevant legislation and regulation. The menthol ban forms part of the wider EUTPDII legislation, however the ban does not apply to cigars and cigarillos. JTI UK no longer sells menthol flavoured cigarettesas menthol flavoured cigarettes have been banned from  May . We are confident that all of our products are fully compliant with UK law. We have taken steps to support our retail customers by educating them about the changes in the law to try to ensure that they were not unlawfully selling menthol and capsule stock following the deadline.Minors should not smoke and should not have access to tobacco products and this belief is central to JTI’s Code of Conduct, marketing practices, operational policies and the way JTI does business.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what are social bubbles Earlier this month Boris Johnson described one social bubble as the household that you live in.These are the people who you live with and come into contact with every day.In a -page document, published on May , the PM laid out his vision on the steps that were necessary to take in order for lockdown to end.In it, he discussed the idea of social bubbles which were based on the New Zeland model of household bubbles.In the lockdown roadmap document, it said: The intention of this change would be to allow those who are isolated, some more social contact and to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions while continuing to limit the risks of chains of transmission.“It would also support some families toto work by, for example, allowing two households to share childcare.In the daily press briefing on May , Boris Johnson said the country was heading into step two of his plan to get the country moving again.In step two of the phase, more than one household or bubble could come into contact with one another.The new proposals may be part of a wider move to allow people to mix in social bubbles of up to  people outdoors.The second stage is hoped to begin on June ,the government is satisfied with the progress made in controlling the pandemic.It is hoped a further relaxing of measures will coincide with theof the first classes to school.Step two also includes the potential reopening of non-essential shops.Mr Johnson said: We will set out what moving to step two means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts over the course of the next week.We are making good progress, but that progress is conditional, provisional.Mr Johnson also said people should get out and enjoy themselves in the open air from June they can.Brits are still unable to meet in big groups and people are advised to use other modes of transport, other than public transportthey can.Cinemas, pubs and hairdressers are still closed and will be shut for most of the summer months.Parts of the hospitality sector are allowed to reopen from July  but they must adhere to social distancing rules.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everyone who thinks of me in a lower light and I understand why they do.She told CNN she wanted to publicly apologize to everyone, and said: Im not a racist.

The dog is now in our rescue’s care and he is safe and in good health.Christian claimed in a Facebook post that Amy reasoned that she went to the Ramble since the parks dog runs are closed and her pet needs his exercise.Christian told WNBC-TV: If the habitat is destroyed we won’t be able to go there to see the birds, to enjoy the plantings.The only way they can keep the dog from eating the treat is to put it on a leash, he said, referring to the moment he offered Amys dog a treat.Christian said he keeps dog treats with him to get dog owners to put the pups on leashes. He said dog owners, in his experience, hate when strangers give their dogs treats and restrain or leash them immediately.But Christian added Amy decided I’m gonna play the race card, I guess.The NYPD confirmed a call came at around am, but no report was filed and no arrests were made after the incident on Monday.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. The One Show, Alex Scott: “Here’s a good reason to stay inside – Joe Lycett’s all over our TV screens.”All Star Happy Hour, Jason Manford to Mo ­Gilligan: “I think you’re doing incredibly well.”This Morning, Phillip Schofield to Louise Gates: “We should say, this isn’t just some nonsense you’ve made up.”Though I’ll leave you to judge that one for ­yourself, by Louise’s caption: “Laughter yoga guru”.ACCORDING to the Gold channel, on Sunday night, “Some bright spark had the idea of asking Britain ‘who is Britain’s Greatest Comedy Character ’ ”You responded to the question by “voting in your thousands”.But Gold clearly disapproved of your choices, so Britain was overruled by a ten-strong “jury of comedy superbrains”, that included Marcus Brigstocke, Shappi Khorsandi and head judge Sally Phillips, who “couldn’t help noticing” the public’s shortlist was “predominantly white men”.I also couldn’t help noticing Gold’s  featured not one person who was Welsh, Northern Irish, Scottish or funny, but these omissions were lost on the ten who were too busy fretting about sexism and racism and denouncing Compo, from Last Of The Summer Wine, as “a pervert”.Three hours of chin-stroking later, I’m Alan Partridge star Sally announced their winner was . . . Alan Partridge.As a way of deciding Britain’s Greatest Comedy Character, it wasn’t ideal.As a way of demonstrating exactly why British television comedy has gone down the toilet, though, it was damn near perfect.TV GOLD: The Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins finale.Every incredible twist of BBC’s Arena: The Changin’ Times Of Ike White documentary.BBC’s Citizens Of Boomtown tribute to The Boomtown Rats.Britain’s Got Talent mentalist Lioz Shem Tov and the mad old walloper, Sandra-May Flowers, who performed Loving You more in the style of The Yorkshire Ripperton than Minnie Riperton.And Climbing Blind, on BBC, because eventhe point of clambering up the ft Old Man of Hoy is lost on you, the love story that made it possible won’t be.ON ITV’s hit-and-miss three-part series Harry’s Heroes, a group of overweight former football internationals – some recovering alcoholics and others ex-gambling addicts – toured Europe trying to work out why they’d never won a major football tournament for England.A total mystery to me as well, guys – and the anecdote about nearly severing Alan Shearer’s toe in a late-night drinking prank certainly shed no further light on the failure.The likes of Neil “Razor” Ruddock, Paul Merson, Matt Le Tissier and manager Harry Redknapp, though, seemed particularly aggrieved and confused about losing to Germany in , which was odd given hardly any of this squad were actually involved in the tournament.So, in an attempt to heal these old wounds, they weaved and bantered their merry way round Europe, playing random games of pub football, in a manner that made The Beatles’ Magical Mystery Tour look like the : bullet train from Tokyo to Nagoya.Along the way, Razor had to leave, at the start of the second instalment, to have a pacemaker fitted, former Welsh international Vinnie Jones played in goal for one game, Michael Owen vanished completely from episode three, like he was still playing for Newcastle United, and David Seaman wisely opted out of the match against some French nudists whose goal celebration pile-up was the very stuff of nightmares.There was also a confrontation between Merson and Razor about the latter’s drinking, and some clumsily staged discussions about addiction and mental health issues, which were robbed of their proper impact through TV’s endless, deadening, virtue-signalling obsession with these subjects.Far more moving was the sight of Paul Merson, clean and sober for the first time in years, gazing with fresh-eyed wonder at the majesty of the Efel Tower while gasping: “What’s the dference between this and the one in Blackpool, then ”Apart from the Efel Tower never hosting Aladdin, with Mooky and Mr Boo the clowns  Very little, Merse.Mike: “Noah.”Ben Shephard: “By what abbreviation is the magazine New Musical Express more commonly known ”Doreen: “NMS.”And Ben Shephard: “In what organ of the human body is the hippocampus located ”Mark: “Bum.”“Brain.” Though, in Mark’s case . . .ITV’s Martin Lewis broadcasting to the nation with two very provocative volumes of tossers’ bible Hip Hotelsin the background.Fleabag finishing above Fletcher from Porridge, on Britain’s Greatest Comedy ­Character.Labour Party PR show Have I Got News For You giving up all pretence of satire with the serious question: “Why have the Press got it in for Keir Starmer ”And Matthew Wright “casually” trying to impress This Morning viewers with the confession he’d broken lockdown, “to go fishing with one of my friends . . . Feargal Sharkey of The Undertones”.Matthew Wright, ladies and gentlemen.

The renovation would include structural work, electrics, and painting and decorating.The building is Grade II listed which means someone moving in would only be able to full refurbish it at the moment, although the estate agent selling it did say extending it might be possible.When renovated it could make a spacious family home although there is a lot to do including rewiring, replumbing, and replastering.In the bathroom, there is an original toilet cistern and freestanding bath - now a sought-after addition to most modern homes.The house currently has a reception hall leading to a big sitting room, kitchen, and three further reception rooms, which could be used as a good sized-dining room, a snug or playroom, and a study or utility room.Stuart Sillars from BTF Partnership, who are selling the property, said someone buying the property could easily spend £, on doing it up, with similar properties in good order making £, to , in the area.Upstairs there are three good-sized bedrooms and a family bathroom.It has gardens to the back of the house and barn, with parking areas, and further neighbouring land that might be up for sale separately.The farmhouse is a short drive from the town of Faversham, which is just under six miles away.From Faversham station, central London can be reached in just over an hour.While it may sound like a lot of work, weve seen similar properties for sale which have required total renovations.These include a six-bed Doncaster house for sale last year for £, which needed a lot of work to make it habitable.While one keen DIY-fan added £, to his property in  days by installing a kitchen.There is an adjoining barn which has planning permission to be converted into another three-bedroom home, although this has already been sold under offer. Mr Sillars added: This is a very traditional and rural Kent farmhouse which is now ready for updating for modern living and it presents a fantastic opportunity for someone looking for a development project.This is a beautul part of the North Kent Downs and the house will once again make a fantastic family home for the future.A popular way to sell a property is via an online raffle, one couple have spent two years renovating a Welsh cottage worth £, and have now put it on sale via raffle tickets for £ each.New rules are now in place for house viewings, including estate agents giving health screenings.Right now stunning mansions are the most viewed properties online.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re helping to tackle loneliness and isolation. You’re providing meals to people that cannot leave home. You’re helping fund projects that support physical and mental health in communities across the entire nation.We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.But thanks to you, £ million of funding from The National Lottery is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and good causes. This vital funding has helped hundreds of key projects continue to offer support to people in our communities.  One of those to benefit is Northern Ireland’s Macular Society, which helps people struggling with their sight due to macular degeneration. They provide peer support, counselling, help, advice and many other services to members. The charity received an additional £, grant from The National Lottery to adapt and increase support for people remotely during lockdown. Elaine Orwinhas been involved with the charity for  years. The -year-old said: Macular disease affects your physical health. You often can’t drive so lose your independence, but our group of  members is a leline. We used to meet monthly, but since lockdown it’s fortnightly virtual meetings, and I’ve also referred people for phone counselling. The contact we have had is really precious.  The charity is planning to launch a befriending service and webinars, and they’ve also run a Tech Talk project, helping members to use computers and even just access audio description on their TVs. It’s really important for us to thank National Lottery players, as without them none of this would be possible. Another project to receive funding is Leicester’s Emerald Centre, which supports vulnerable people of all ages, including elderly residents and those with disabilities, in a deprived area of the city.  Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us. Merthyr Tydfil’s Twyn Community Hubhas also received support, with a £, grant from The National Lottery to expand their daily hot meals and weekly hamper project during lockdown. The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

So thanks to Downing Street for taking me back to my childhood and putting on Carry On Bullsh*tting. That sketch about testing your eyes for a long drive by going for a longish one with your four-year-old in the car was cracking. But the longer this excruciating exhibition of detachedness from reality went on, the less funny it was. The interview was a Prince Andrew-style car crash. And the sight of Cummings sucking in all the political oxygen due to breaking lockdown rules we had all been sticking to, on a day when we were waiting to hear from the Prime Minister when we could start to dismantle them, was a national disgrace. His contempt for the Little People was evident from the off when he turned up more than half an hour late. It continued when he kept answering questions by saying “with great respect” when his face was sneering at the reporter he was supposedly respecting. The haughty disdain continued when he read out what sounded like an Enid Blyton story called Three Go For A Pee In The Woods. It read like a litany of excuses we’ve all heard given in school as teachers howled in disbelief.  Any moment I expected him to say he only drove to Durham because the cat peed on his satnav.

Helen Goodman last visited her father Alan, , five weeks before he died at a care home in Barnard Castle - one of the places Mr Cummings visited after travelling from London to his parentsapos house to self-isolate while he and his we had Covid- symptoms. Ms Goodman, the MP for Bishop Auckland in Co Durham from  to ,  said her dad didnapost understand why she couldnapost visit him during the lockdown even though she lived just  yards away. In an opinion piece for the , she wrote: So to learn that Dominic Cummings was in Barnard Castle,  miles from his home in London, at a time when the government was discouraging tourism, is sickening.to start your day with Jason Beattie’s email briefing at mirror email - bringing analysis of the political picture straight to your inbox. Ms Goodman said her dad, who wasnapost tested for coronavirus before or after his death on April , had dficulty communicating over video calls She wrote: The prime minister’s defence of Cummings adds insult to injury for the relatives of those who have died from Covid- and other causes during lockdown, who are unable to grieve for their relatives properly as funeral attendances are restricted. The former MP said Mr Cummingsapos explanation for his travels were offensive to those abiding by the lockdown rules and Government advice to stay at home and to self-isolate at homeany family member developed symptoms. She added: To visit the north-east, ignore the rules and put other people’s health at risk displays an arrogance that people find both repellent and alarming. Were our sacrices for nothing  Meanwhile, a growing number of Conservative MPs have voiced their frustration over Mr Cummings after he said that he had no regrets about his trip to Durham. In a press conference on Sunday, Mr Cummings - Boris Johnsonaposs chief adviser - defended a -mile trip from London to the north-east of England he made with his family during lockdown, explaining that he believes he behaved reasonably. However on Tuesday, Douglas Ross, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, quit the Government, saying that he could not in good faith defend Mr Cummingsapos actions. It follows criticism from a string of Tory MPs, including veteran Sir Roger Gale who said that the Conservative backbench  Committee should make it clear to Boris Johnson that Dominic Cummings should go.  The time I think has come for Mr Cummings to resign or for the PM to dispense of his services, Sir Roger said. The North Thanet MP said: There are people on the  executive who are courageous, and thataposs their job. They are elected to tell the PM what he needs to hear, not what he wants to hear. Senior Tory William Wragg said that it was humiliating and degrading to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of Mr Cummings.  Mr Wragg, chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee in the Commons, said: We cannot throw away valuable public and political good will any longer. Itaposs humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an adviser. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation. Tory MP Caroline Nokes, chairwoman of the Commons women and equalities committee, said she had informed her party whips there could not be wriggle room for some people when it comes to lockdown rules.  The former immigration minister tweeted: I made my views clear to my whip yesterday. There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made dficult sacrices over the course of the last nine weeks. Conservative MP for Rugby Mark Pawsey said that Mr Cummings had acted very much against the spirit of the lockdown rules and should be sacked. He said: Hehas not expressed any regret for the damage his actions have caused to the Government, or to the sense of collective effort in staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.

Many constituents have pointed out thateveryone had behaved as Mr Cummings did, the success of our lockdown policy would have been undermined. Almost every one of them has set out, sometimes in heartbreaking detail, the personal sacrices that they have made during the immensely challenging months since the coronavirus outbreak. As such, I believe that it is wrong that Mr Cummings remains in an important post in Government. I had hoped he would tender his resignation of his own accord. As he has failed to do so, I now believe it is right for the Prime Minister to ask for his resignation. Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper also said he believes Mr Cummings should have offered his resignation to the Prime Minister. He said he would expect an adviser who had damaged the credibility of the Governmentaposs central message so badly and had become the story to consider their position. In a statement posted on Twitter, the Forest of Dean MP wrote: In the round, an argument can be made for Mr Cummingsapos trip to Durham and his actions as a father. However, the conclusion he reached as to whether this was the right course of action is not the conclusion I believe many of my constituents and people across our country would have reached.

The bargain end-terrace property has been listed to let in the proud former mining village of Horden, Co Durham. Experts believe it is the cheapest family home to rent in the UK for many years. The “spacious” double-glazed property, just a short stroll from a beach and near two schools, features two double bedrooms, fitted bathroom and two reception rooms.The s home is a whopping  per cent cheaper than the average £,-a-month cost of a two-bed property in London’s exclusive Mayfair. But some locals issued a warning to would-be tenants that certain streets in the village were plagued with Asbo yobs. Former primary school teacher Doug Langan, , said: “There is a lot to like about Horden. There’s a great community spirit and it’s right on the coast.” But he added of the area where the house stands: “Some of the houses are owned by retired miners who have been there  years but others have gone to rack and ruin. £ is cheap but you will get what you pay for.”Fth Street, just  yards from Durham’s Heritage Coast, has proved a hit with ­families searching for a budget base. The low-cost let could even be popular with commuters in larger towns able to work from home and looking to save a fortune.

Katherine Jablonowska, , and Ryan Mclean, , first purchased the property in  and began the slow renovation process. After two years of laborious -hours days, the couple have finally transformed the once tired and old-fashioned property into a luxurious peaceful home. But now theyaposre looking to sell the home in a competition in a bid to raise money for charity. The cottage can be found in North Wales, on the Ll n Peninsula, just on the outskirts of the idyllic Snowdonia National Park. It was originally built in the early s and was a traditional working barn before it was converted into a family home. Now the property boasts a dining area which leads on to a bespoke kitchen, as well as two good-sized double bedrooms, both of which have stunning views as well as one bathroom.  The couple called the two-year renovation a wonderful experience as they look back on their progress, but Ryan admits: Itaposs been quite the journey.It took approximately  months. It was long, hard days - from am to pm. It was very much a hands-on project. The bathroom was completely ripped out and now features a luxurious roll-top bath with a built-in shower overhead.  And the living space undertook one of the biggest transformations as the pair brought the fire places to le, adding a television to one alcove and small fire heater to the other. Ryan said: It started off as a working barn so we tried to keep a few of those features, the ones that were hidden when we bought it. We got a lot of ideas from Instagram and YouTube. Thereaposs a big renovating community - the amount of people willing to share ideas.  Chef Ryan and hospitality manager Katherine took on part-time jobs in the local area to supplement their incomes while they carried out the renovation. He added: Two years ago, we decided to take a break from it all to do this. It turned out to be exactly what we needed. But we had some idea of what we were doing. I did come at this with a decent amount of experience. We definitely donapost want to give the impression that this kind of renovation is really easy!  And one of the most beautul areas of the house is the landscape it backs onto. A small patio area overlooks miles of picturesque rolling hills - the perfect place to enjoy a meal in the summertime.  Katherine said: The idea was in the back of our minds for a few years. We had come across raffles in the news every now and then. We thought: aposThataposs a good ideaapos. So we spent some time researching it - and thought it was a fantastic way to sell a house.  It gives someone the chance to get on the property ladder. Itaposs a little piece of heaven. However, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic the couple are unsure of where they are going next as their plans have gone out of the window. If youaposre looking to get involved in the coupleaposs competition, there is a website designated to the sale titled aposCwellyn Dreamapos – with a tagline of apos£ could change your le.apos The competition is open now, with a target of , entries and the winner will be revealed on September .

Rather than opting for a dficult to reach cupboard or forgoing sweet treats entirely, the nurse decided to buy a vending machine.The-mum-of-four snatched herself a bargain from Facebook Market Place where one was going for just £.Now her brood can buy themselves an unhealthy treat or push the buttons and get a healthy one for free.  Sarah wrote on her Instagram : Lets seethey can sneak sweets and treats now!So sick of the arguments about unhealthy snacksso I have bought a vending machine! If they want sweets they can do thingsto earn money for them.  The kids are very excited about this but not as excited as me! Sarah, who filled the machine up with treats from BM, added: I’m not unreasonable. I’ve put them in at cost price hahahaha. It is not the first time the Newcastle mum has shown a knack for ingenious home hacks.Last year Sarah and her husband Kyle transformed their conservatory into an incredible soft play room for the kids complete with a ball pit and slide.

Beaches and beauty spots were packed on Bank Holiday Monday and popular again on Tuesday have fuelled concerns that weeks of progress could be undone by a second wave of Covid-. And it is feared Boris Johnsonaposs decision to back Dominic Cummingsapos lockdown trip to Durham could undermine the Governmentaposs safety messages and lead to people choosing to flout the rules. As pictures show packed coastal and beauty spots where social distancing was a challenge, Britons are being reminded to use common sense and do their part to prevent the virusapos spread.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening.Health chiefs, councils and police forces have said that a majority of people are complying with the emergency laws and guidelines as more fine weather tempts Britons outside. While lockdown restrictions continue to be eased, crowds flocked to beauty spots on Bank Holiday Monday, raising concerns in some areas. Beaches and beauty spots were busy again on Tuesday. Waverley Borough Council in Surrey issued a warning to those visiting the village of Frensham, tweeting: Please be aware that the car park is filling up quickly and it is very busy so social distancing will be hard.On Monday, thousands of people flocked to beaches in places such as Brighton, Southend and Bournemouth, where the local council reminded people there were other less busy but equally lovely open spaces to enjoy. Sunbathers were seen brawling on a beach in Broadstairs, Kent, and police were called to a lido in north London amid reports of one large group gathering. With schools in England, Scotland and Wales on a half-term break this week, large numbers of people are expected to emerge from lockdown amid warm conditions. A week after the relaxation of guidelines to allow people to visit beauty spots in England, the Government and the police have urged people to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. Please use common sense when it comes to social distancing, the politan Policeaposs Hillingdon branch tweeted. Apart from crowds at beaches on Monday, long stretches of traffic were also seen at the Yorkshire Dales, while walkers were also out enjoying the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Former Greater Manchester Police chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said officers are frustrated by the Dominic Cummings case, adding it is dficult to see the policeaposs role in controlling lockdown. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Thereaposs a lot of confusion and it feels like thereaposs quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and whataposs happening on the street. I think itaposs quite hard to see the role the police have in the future - the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday itaposs hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.  While new cases and deaths from coronavirus have fallen nationally, a hospital in Somerset was forced to close this weekend due to a high number of Covid- patients. Weston General Hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, stopped accepting new admissions, including into its AE department from am on Monday. As the hospital shut as a precautionary measure, some residents in Weston reported concern over high numbers of people enjoying a day at the seaside. Locals have blamed tourists and VE Day celebrations for the new coronavirus spike that closed Weston General Hospital. On Facebook, one local said: People start flocking to Weston, then cases spike in Weston. Itaposs not rocket science to work out that cramming on the beach, not social distancing has played a big part in this. Stay in your own counties!  Many people would have gone to Weston with the virus and a lot more would have left with it and will now be spreading it around their own communities too! Another blaming VE day celebrations said: They blame it on tourists but loads got together to celebrate VE day, and this spike coincides with VE day - itaposs not always tourists! Many called for lockdown restrictions to be re-tightened and for people to use their common sense. Others called for more police presence.

Meanwhile, % had lost their job and were waiting for Universal Credit Claims, % are facing eviction, and % are over the age of . Melanie Rochford from the Trussell Trust said: In times of crisis, more people than ever need help from food banks.  The Covid- pandemic has placed signicant demand on our already overstretched resources to support iniduals and families living below the poverty line. Last year the primary trigger for food poverty was low pay. We are now seeing even more people coming to the service because they are unemployed and struggling to make ends meet. Investec’s support has been an absolute leline. I don’t know what we would have done without it.Investec is working with key suppliers - including Creed in England, Dunns in Scotland, Lidl in Northern Ireland, and Aldi in London - to create the supply chains necessary to stock the food banks. All the food banks belong to the Trussell Trust apart from Edinburgh’s Fresh Start, who are a longstanding community partner of Investec, as well Newham’s First Love Foundation in east London. Deborah Sayagh from Investec Private Bank added: Our ambition in supporting the food banks is that they will always have more than they need over the coming months.  In east London, we have been able to supply nearly , food items and support hundreds of families through this crisis. We are committed to working with them as long as required. At Investec, we fully believe in supporting our local communities and making sure that we live within society, rather than off of it.

She says the daily walk is aposusually a great and enjoyable time for our familyapos but recently her dad and -year-old sister have got aposreally intoapos a game they call apospoop tagapos. After one of the dogs has done its business and itaposs been cleared up and bagged, the pair enjoy running around and throwing the dog poop bag at other members of the family. I hate this game, she said. I don’t like getting poop, evenit’s in a bag, thrown at me and I don’t find it funny. I told them multiple times I would not walk with themthis continued. I think they thought I was joking, because they would not stop AND added new components to this game - wave poop above my head, pretend to hit me with it with large swings.

Her dad and sister have since apologised and askedshe will rejoin them on the evening walks - but she says sheaposs still mad about poop tag and needs a aposcouple more days to get over thisapos. After sharing details of the game on Reddit, other users were left disgusted as one simply asked: What the HELL is wrong with your family      A second said: SERIOUSLY. POOP TAG.

Having that sort of identity going forward.”Appere particularly impressed Connolly, with the -year-old ing from a loan spell at Broughty Athletic in the juniors like a new man.The young attacker has a terric first campaign with the Tangerines, scoring six goals in  appearances and capping it off with a call up in the Scotland U  squad.Connolly continued: “I don’t know what Louis did last summer.“He wasn’t at that level before that but in pre-season he came back, we did a run and he was flying.“In training he was holding people off, using his body. He was like a dferent player.“When you see him running beside you, you have to get away from him because he’s a machine and he’ll show you up.“He’s one of the fittest guys I’ve ever seen now.“I’ve been asking him what he did last summer but he won’t tell me!”As much as the Terrors dominated the league, Connolly was quick to praise the quality of the Championship, particularly part-time teams Alloa and Arbroath.The defender added: “It was my first time in the Championship and it’s a tough league.“It’s a very, very unpredictable league. A lot of the teams you play are more direct.“I found when I was at Kilmarnock, the Premiership was easier at times because you knew what style you were going to be playing against.“Whereas, in the Championship you can come up against  players behind the ball for  minutes.“People can say ‘we have the best players’ and this and that but it’s still very dficult to play against.“Everyone expected us to win every week and always put us downwe didn’t but I think the character of everyone at the club was huge to get over that.“People need to give the likes of Alloa and Arbroath a lot more credit.“The majority of Arbroath’s team could play full-time and Alloa are probably the best team we’ve played, technically.“They pass the ball and play a certain way that suits them.“We struggled against them but they’re actually a decent team.”Connolly missed a chunk of last season with a hamstring injury and, as much as it was hard watching on at times, he is delighted the squad achieved their aim.He is now looking forward to top-flight football when the action s.Connolly reflected: “It was tough – it had been an up and down season for me personally because I had the aim of coming back and being as fit and as lean as I could.“It was probably one of the best shapes I’d been in and I probably pushed myself too hard at times trying to get to that level.“Watching from the side at that stage at the start, when we’d lost a few games, was really, really dficult.“I just wanted to be a part of it and help.“Then when we went on a run it was brilliant to see. That pushed me on to get back as fit as I could, as quick as I could.“The confidence was just sky high, the boys were flying and it was brilliant for me to get some fitness up and back into the team.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/03/POLITICS-PMQs-SNP-12183203_35109450-754x564.jpg ","title":"no apology and no contrition scottish politicians react to press conference by special adviser dominic cummings","story":"Scotland#s politicians have had their say in response to the unprecedented press conference conducted by the Prime Minister#s special adviser, Dominic Cummings.Mr Cummings has been accused of undermining Boris Johnson#s government coronavirus messaging after admitting travelling hundreds of miles during the peak of the UK lockdown.Mr Cummings refused to apologise for his actions, did not resign and explained he had spoken to Mr Johnson when the pair were in their sick beds weeks ago, but neither could recall the conversation.Moray MP Douglas Ross has resigned from Boris Johnson’s government over the lockdown controversy.Mr Ross, who has served as a junior Scotland Office minister since December, announced his resignation on social media.Scottish Conservative MSPs have been approached for comment.Scottish Conservative MP Andrew Bowie did not respond to a request for comment.Scottish Conservative MSPs from the North East and Mid Scotland and Fe parliamentary regions did not respond to a request for comment.Scottish Conservative MP David Duguid said: #Some people may disagree with the judgements made by Mr Cummings and many will have already made up their minds before hearing the full story.#However, I think many people will now look at this afresh and consider some of the news coverage in a dferent light. The Prime Minister has said he satisfied that Mr Cummings acted properly and has made his judgement on the matter.#SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford MP said: #What should have been a resignation statement turned out to be a botched PR exercise that changes nothing. It is now beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules.“There was no apology and no contrition from Mr Cummings for his behaviour – and now, following this unrepentant press conference, there are no excuses left for him.“He has done nothing but double down on the double standards he has displayed and which millions of people across the UK are furious about.#Let’s be clear, there is nothing about Mr Cummings that is exceptional except his complete inability to realise he broke the rules.“The Prime Minister has no option but to sack Mr Cummings. His failure to do so so far is a gross failure of leadership.“Boris Johnson has apparently known about this for weeks, has failed to offer any answers himself and now has no option but to sack Dominic Cummings and answer questions about his own role in the Downing Street cover-up.#Boris Johnson#s failure to show leadership is damaging the public health message and putting lives at risk, as leading public health experts have warned.#The longer the Prime Minister allows this farce to continue, the more the Tory government will lose credibility and respect. He must sack Mr Cummings without further delay.#Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for Cummings to be sacked immediately, while Lib Dem MP Wendy Chamberlain said he had undermined advice designed to save lives.She said: #Instead of telling us any new information, Cummings’ statement feels contorted and made to fit with the facts already in the public domain.#The most worrying thing about the Dominic Cummings press conference is that the prime minister heard this version of events yesterday and both accepted and stated it demonstrated responsibility and integrity.#The only new information that Cummings has provided are admissions of further breaches of the rules. He has undermined the public advice designed to save lives and his position is now beyond untenable.#Dundee East SNP MSP Shona Robison said: #It’s clear that Dominic Cummings has broken a number of lockdown rules.#Today we saw no apologies and no regrets. People in Dundee have made huge sacrices over the past few months to obey the rules, while Boris Johnson#s most senior adviser was breaking them, he should do the decent thing and resign.#Mr Leonard said: #Dominic Cummings has failed in his attempt to justy his actions.#What is particularly upsetting for people listening to his statement is that they have followed the lockdown rules while Dominic Cummings did not.#Some people have missed the chance to spend final moments with a loved one, some have missed their loved ones’ funerals. Some have had no help with childcare, despite illness. Some people’s sacrices during this time will leave a lasting trauma.#Dominic Cummings has not apologised for his actions. He stands by his decision to put other people#s lives in danger, showing he believes he is above the rules everyone  is following.#Boris Johnson’s handling of this situation has been unacceptable. Dominic Cummings should be sacked immediately.#Dunfermline SNP MP Douglas Chapman said: #He has not resigned, he#s not sorry, he has severely undermined confidence in the UK Government and their ability to govern with our consent.#In Scotland we have a road map to get out of this health crisis. Let#s focus on support and help for all, instead of the selfishness of one person.#Brexit secretary Michael Russell MSP said: #Can’t but think that this tears away the curtain to reveal a rather pathetic inidual , very far from the master of the universe he has made himself out to be.

Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st.

A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

four-day working week Quite simply, it is as the name suggests.Instead of working five days, you will be working four ndash but rather than compressing the usual hours, an employee has reduced

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-caravan-bid-rejected","story":"Lammermuir Livery and Stables wanted to provide accommodation for relief staff for their stable manager to live at their rural base at Castlemains Farm, Gford, to run the business.And they hoped East Lothian Council would back their planthe caravans were hidden from sight on nearby land already used to store mobile homes and other vehicles.However councillor officers refused to grant planning permission and the councilrsquos Local Review Body backed their decision during an online meeting this week when they refused an appeal against it.The planning application, which was retrospective also asked for permission to have an office, already built at the entrance to to site, but that was also rejected by the review body.Making their case for the caravans, the firm said: ldquoWhen considering this we were aware of the visual impact a caravan could have on the landscapeand decided the best option would be to site the caravan in the existing storage yard in an area designated for that purpose, this area already has caravans stored, which we have permission forand therefore the caravan would not be a new thing in that area.HoweverCouncillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairperson, described the decision to let people live in a storage area as lsquounacceptablersquo.He said: ldquoI do not think residential caravans on a storage site is an acceptable place for people to be living.The stables had also argued that there was not secure space within the equestrian buildings it had at he farm for an office and one needed to be built on another part of the land, however this was also dismissed by the review body.Members carried out inidual site visits to the farm ahead of meeting todayonline.Councillor Sue Kempson said: ldquoThe caravans are in the wrong place and should not be used as living accommodation on a storage site, it sets a precedent.ldquoLooking around the equestrian site there is plenty of room to provide a secure office so I am supporting the officersrsquo decision.Fellow body member Councillor Kenny McLeod made the decision unanimous when he ruled the office and caravans were too far away from the centre itself to be of any benefit.Planning officers refused the original application for temporary planning permission for five years for the office and caravans retrospectively, stating there was no business case for the equestrian business to support the need for the additional building and that the caravans would set an ldquoundesirable precedent.The applicants had told the review body their agent, who had been asked to provide a business case, had ldquovanished and they had no knowledge of the request."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

For over a year this tiny offshoot has been sinking its roots deep. Above ground, however, itrsquos little more than a frond. With the solicitude of a father for his firstborn, Alan has been watering it since March, and awaiting the first leaves of the season. Buds eventually appeared, followed by the unfurling of glistening leaves the colour of old pennies. Just the other day he witnessed the arboreal equivalent of a childrsquos first day at school: a sparrow alighting on its branches, treating it like a real tree.The gardener who told us how to plant it said that it canrsquot get enough watering. Itrsquoll take however much you pour on it, allowing roots to take hold, and speeding its growth. So when eventually the clouds opened the other evening, it was the infant beech I thought of, soaking it up before reaching for the sky.As the rain pounded on the skylights, I stood at the window. Lit by the streetlamp on the village green, water filled the cobbled gutter. It rushed blackly towards the drain, a sprinkling of fallen apple blossom bobbing on the tide, asa wedding party had just passed. Through the small hours the downpour continued. I could lie awake all night listening to it. When I was growing up my bedroom was in an attic. Early in the morning seagullsrsquo flippers would patter over the roof, and the slightest breath of wind or rain was amplied by the rattling windows and nearby trees. The worse the weather, the more I enjoyed it.This astonishingly dry and sunny spring has been a boon during lockdown, the best possible antidote to gloom. I donrsquot like to imagine how miserable it would have beenthere had been incessant damp and cloudy skies. Yet surrounded as we are in Hoolet by fields of crops, and with flocks and herds munching grass, lack of rain means everything suffers. Cattle especially have been known to break out in search of water, thirst driving them slightly nuts.Following last weekrsquos cloudburst, the village has emerged from its dousing like a bridesmaid from the hairdresserrsquos. At first light the blackbirds were out in force, working their way across the green, combing every inch. I read that itrsquos been a good year for blackbirds, but that was hardly news. The place has been jumping with them for weeks, males chasing off rivals or fighting mid-air asreenacting the Battle of Britain. Females have been shopping for worms in pairs. No patch of lawn or grass goes unforaged, the birds keeping several feet apart, like customers at a supermarket checkout. Ousting wood pigeons and thrushes from telegraph poles, they declare their territory and every few minutes one flies past the window at such speed, yoursquod think it had been fired from a gun.A year or two past, one of our neighbours found a blackbird lying stricken in his garden. Alive but bleeding, it was being mobbed by other birds. He took out a chair, and sat near it for the rest of the afternoon, until it had recovered enough to fly off. He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart. You feel a pheasant is capable of walking on to the Christmas platter and arranging the carrots and parsnips around itself while it waits for the gravy blackbirds, on the other hand, know how to take advantage of what we can offer.Given the kerfuffle they make in the beech hedge, they could be devouring a packet of crisps. They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green. Irsquom less certain about our bluetits. Occasional cheeping can be heard from the nest box, but itrsquos too early to knowtheyrsquoll survive. Caterpillars are their food of choice, but as the butterfly population declines, so does their larder. Might they have something put away in case of a rainy day "},{"url":null,"title":"paul-tamburrinis-lockdown-feast-caesar-salad-fried-chicken-chococolate-cate-chocolate-sorbet","story":"This weeks recipes are a sumptuous three-course meal fit for any table:Caesar salad with lettuce emulsionServes - starters Romaine lettuce hearts, cut into bite sized bitesg parmesan shavings fillets of good quality anchovies in oil, halved waysFor the bread croutons Day old baguetteExtra virgin olive oilSea saltFor the dressingfrac cloves of garlic, green germ removed and finely grated fillets of salted anchovies in oil free range eggsml red wine vinegartsp Dijon mustardml grapeseed oilg finely grated parmesanJuice of frac lemonfrac tsp of Worcestershire sauce drops of TabascoSalt and black pepper to tasteFor the lettuce emulsiong Baby gems leaves, green only ndash washed frac tsp Dijon mustardml vegetable oilml cold waterTable saltFor the bread tuillesPreheat the oven to C ndash cut  very thinly slices from the baguette, so you have  per person.

But it highlights going green as part of a recovery that would cut carbon emissions and create jobs, while including support for investment in clean industry and transport, making buildings net-zero, carbon capture and storage.The plan would also seek to take better advantage of Scotlandrsquos green energy revolution, which the Herald revealed was increasingly being placed in the hands of overseas firms.Camleys Cartoon: Green energy jobs.In Scotland, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has revealed it wants to see a new Future Jobs Fund to back a construction and \"deep\" retrofit housing programme, to make existing homes more environmentally friendly, while creating \"good quality\" jobs and driving decarbonisation of heat, reducing emissions and fuel bills.In , in the wake of a financial crisis which resulted in the bailout of banks the threat of high youth unemployment loomed, and the government created the Future Jobs Fund, which paid employers a wage subsidy to take on young people.The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by , five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.An upgrade to our existing housing stock to be become energy-efficient means improving the fabric of the buildings.STUC deputy general secretary Dave Moxham said that capital investment should go into a \"better regulated\" construction sector and \"serious consideration\" given to the creation of a Scottish National Construction company.\"Scotlandrsquos housing stock, with a high proportion of tenement properties, is not the easiest to retrofit with energy saving measures such as insulation and new heating systems, however progress on deep retrofit has been identied as one of the key elements in achieving net zero,\" he said.\"There has also been a tendency to shallow retrofit building meaning that one emissions saving measure is introduced with other adaptations undertaken later on or not at all. This crisis and the need to plan better and create jobs provides an ideal opportunity establish a programme of deep-retrofit, nationally co-ordinated and locally delivered.\"It is analogous to the massive effort in the early s when the UK converted millions of gas boilers to be offshore gas compliant, creating thousands upon thousands of jobs and massively boosting the economy. Such a programme is best driven by state investment and delivered through nationally co-ordinated or even a nationalised construction company. As well as providing a much needed boost for jobs and apprenticeships it would have a serious and positive impact on fuel poverty.\"The Coalition for the Energy Efficiency of Buildingsargues that such a retrofit programme would slash emissions, create jobs and could reboot a battered post-Covid economy.The CEEB, which is backed by the UK government and the City of London Corporation, argues that such an approach would support more than , skilled and semi-skilled construction jobs, provide a quick economic stimulus and boost consumer spending through energy cost savings.Mr Moxham said lessons can be learned from the collapse of construction giant Carillion two years ago which cost UK taxpayers an estimated poundm.When it was liquidated with debts of pound.bn, the firm had about  UK public sector contracts.\"The collapse provided evidence of how an massive under-regulated private sector companies can fail with all real risk transferred to workers and the public sector,\" he said.\"A publicly owned construction company could guarantee better and less precarious employment practices twinned with a co-ordinated approach to green construction and retrofitting.\"Undertaking such actions requires investment and increases government indebtedness, however the nature of such government borrowing is that it is borrowing against its own future. \"Thus a green Future Jobs Fund would see a massive expansion in the training of and provision of good jobs for young people. Taken in conjunction with overall economic boost it would provide one of the most effective ways to borrow to invest.\"In , a Scottish Government report stated the offshore wind sector alone offered the potential for , direct jobs and a further , jobs in related industries, as well as pound.bn investment in Scotland by .The Scottish Governmentrsquos low carbon strategydescribed the large scale development of offshore wind as representing the ldquobiggest opportunity for sustainable economic growth in Scotland for a generation with Scotland having an estimated % of Europersquos offshore wind potential.But in February, it emerged that it had in fact created just sixper cent of the , direct jobs predicted. Official estimates stated that there were just , full-time jobs in the offshore wind sector in Scotland, a fraction of the numbers projected by .Mr Moxham said: \"Thus far the then First Minister Alex Salmonds comments that Scotland would become the lsquoSaudi Arabiarsquo of renewables has failed to materialise.\"He said there should be \"much stricter conditionality\" attached to contracts for renewable construction in Scotland to \"ensure a radical improvement\" in the number of local supply chain jobs in offshore and other renewables.\"It is essential that we offer meaningful and well-paid employment for those likely to suffer from the current and longer-term downturn in offshore oil and gas,\" he said.His views come as the TUC called for the government to form a National Recovery Council to help the economy heal from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.It said lessons can be learned from former prime minister Clement Attleersquos  government, which inherited massive wartime debts but saw them slide rapidly as the economy recovered.The Labour administration launched the NHS, a welfare safety net and mass housebuilding, nationalised industries and sought to boost demand to maintain full employment.d on short-term crisis management and wary about the rising costs of existing crisis measures.TUC analysis showed that the decade of investment for growth between  and  that followed World War II achieved an average growth rate of . per cent.

She is an impressive leader. And not just in her delivery.Ms Sturgeonrsquos political handling of this crisis has also been exemplary. She has followed essentially the same strategy as the UK Government, made all the same mistakes and then some, but has somehow managed to devolve responsibility for those mistakes to Westminster.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: No country for old men. The bitter harvest in Scotlandrsquos care homesLast week, she unveiled her four-step programme for ing to normality which is, in all major respects, the same as the UK one. But by delaying it a fortnight, while accusing Boris Johnson of playing ldquoRussian roulette with peoplersquos lives she has made it sound asshersquos protected Scots from a government of Bolsanaro-emulating herd immunity fanatics.There is not a great deal of evidence for this. Nicola Sturgeon said a fortnight ago that it was not safe to follow the UK path because the ldquoall-important R number in Scotland was too high at between . and .. Yet last week, as she announced her new regime, the R number was still between . and ..She insists that the number of infections is down, which is true. But the rate of spread of the virus, which R measures, is not crucially dependent on the number of cases. The risk of the pandemic getting loose again has changed very little.But people think it has, and in politics, that is all that really matters. ldquo#ThankYouNicola was trending on social media. The SNP is riding ever higher in popularity. The FMrsquos treatment by opposition leaders in the chamber sounded almost respectful.There has been an assumption, shared by most of the Scottish media, that Nicola Sturgeon is showing the way, not following a few steps behind. Her government commands a degree of respect that Westminster lacks. ldquoIrsquom sorry to interrupt you, Mr Swinney, said a reverential Good Morning Scotland presenter the day after the route map was unveiled.Yet, in that very interview, the Deputy First Minister all but admitted that the governmentrsquos aim of , contact tracers by next week was falling way short. Only  have been signed up, but Swinney assured us that this would be quite enough. Oh yes.On testing, the Scottish Governmentrsquos record is poor any way you look at it. Not only in contact tracing which is well behind England, where , tracers have been recruited, but also in the headline number of tests.The UK was testing , a day last week and is on course for , a day. In Scotland only , are being tested, according to the Scottish Parliament Information Service. On a per-capita basis it should be almost ten times that.Now, the purpose of all this testing is admittedly unclear, north and south of the Border. The clinical advisers in Scotland have always been distinctly cool on community testing, at least in the current phase. The former CMO, Dr Catherine Catherwood, famously called it a ldquodistraction.However, everyone agrees now that one of the major failings of the UKrsquos response to the pandemic was a lack of preparedness and a failure to install the architecture of TTI: test, track and isolate. Progress in Scotland can only be described as glacial.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Its easy to scare people into staying home harder to persuade them to come out againThen there is the avoidable tragedy in Scotlandrsquos care homes, which I wrote about last week. This was the policy, hotly denied, that old people were cleared out of acute hospitals without proper testing and sent often to care homes where the virus spread rapidly.Last week, the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, finally came clean about the elderly clearance, and said nearly , had been discharged in March alone. She had previously said only  had been so decanted.This is a serious error and calls into question the competence of the minister and the health service bureaucrats upon whom she relies. It comes on top of the inexplicable failure to inform the public about the major Covid outbreak in February at a Nike conference in Edinburgh.There is every sign of a massive buck-passing operation between the NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer, the Care Inspectorate and the private care homes, all trying to blame each other for the care home scandal.Nicola Sturgeon admitted last week that there had been a panic reaction to the forecast of , Covid deaths made in mid-March by the disgraced Imperial College epidemiologist, Professor Neil Ferguson. She said hospitals feared they were about to be ldquofilled up with coronavirus cases and so discharged as many old patients as possible into care. In the event, the wards have lain empty as old people died.Nearly half of all Covid deaths in Scotland have been in care homes. The misery this policy has inflicted on Scotlandrsquos senior citizens, dying in cruel isolation, is unimaginable.Lessons will be learned etc. However, no-one seems to regard these as lessons particularly for the First Minister. Similarly, criticism of confusions in her route map to normality go right over her head.Garden centres and bowling greens can open, but people canrsquot use the toilets, which make it rather pointless. The ldquoblended solution to teaching means parents will have to remain at home even after schools go back in August. The tourism and hospitality industry is in despair, forecasting losses of up to , jobs.But Nicola Sturgeon is safe and socially distanced from blame. She has the shield of confidence around her, burnished by the flattering attentions of legions SNP supporters, who dominate social media.It has now become clear that the PMrsquos closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been bending the lockdown rules to travel Durham, with the full sanction of Boris Johnson.The UK media seems mainly interested in using Scotland as a stick to beat the Prime Minister. The Sky presenter, Kay Burley, urged UK political leaders last week to ldquotake a leaf out of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos book.It is also, of course, because Boris Johnsonrsquos handling of the crisis has been confused and erratic. The messaging about ldquoStay Alert was vague, the rules about travel incomprehensible, the attempt to reopen the schools cack-handed.:Iain Macwhirter: Failures over testing means no end to coronavirus lockdown in ScotlandThe UK Government has oscillated between promises of wonder apps and ldquogame-changing breakthroughs, like antibody tests, and panicky pronouncements that have led to invasive crackdowns by the police. The decision to introduce draconian -day quarantine for travellers may have made sense two or three months ago, but seems pointless now.Westminsterrsquos approach has been an object lesson in poor leadership, which will be examined by students of governance for many years.

To complain that Scotland is at least \"three weeks behind England\" ignores the fact that the virus has taken time to spread northwards. It is now some weeks since Covid- peaked in London. Then for some reason he criticises the First Minister for pursuing a four-phased approach to easing lockdown which is \"in sharp contrast to what the Prime Minister has introduced\". But surely such a phased approach in England is exactly what Boris Johnson announced, and indeed Downing Street has just claimed credit for what is now being rolled out in Scotland The real problem, however, for Mr Stevenson is public reaction. I think that it is abundantly clear that the cautious and measured approach of our First Minister commands considerable public support, which stands in stark contrast with how Boris Johnsonrsquos decisions are perceived. His rushed and ill-thought-out decision to insist that schools in England should be opened on June  is a classic example of how not to proceed. While here in Scotland the decision to bring pupils back to school on August  Not surprisingly the mood in England is one of confusion and concern. According to reports, the UK Governmentrsquos policy to reopen schools will not be followed by perhaps as many as  local authorities. Teaching unions have expressed serious reservations on behalf of their members. Schools and teachers have been given little time to physically prepare their teaching programmes, classrooms, toilets and playgrounds for the childrenrsquos safe . The scientic advice also urges caution. The Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England warns that ldquothe essential well-ing local test, trace and isolate protocols will not be in place in England by early June, Not surprisingly the latest opinion poll suggests that the June  start has the support of only  per cent of parents a large majority would prefer a September . This is in marked contrast to experience here, where I would suggest public support for the \"glacial easing\" remains strong.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.STRUAN Stevensons article was a timely reminder,such were needed, that the Tories have,anything, consolidated their position as the Nasty Party. His advocacy of rapid easing of lockdown belittles the suffering of those who have already died from the effects of the virus, the courage and dedication of those in the NHS and the care sector and the fears of those of us who, because of existing medical conditions, are at high riskwe contract the virus. While recognising the damage that the economy is suffering, the cavalier disregard he displays for the human costs likely to be incurred through easing too much, too soon, is appalling.We should, of course, not be surprised by this. The UK has a Prime Minister who lies, sleeps around and failed to take action in the early stages of the pandemic, preferring meaningless twaddle about British exceptionalism. In Priti Patel we have a Home Secretary who smirkingly advances legislation that would shut off the opportunities granted to her family in the past ldquopull up the drawbridge, Im OK. Jacob Rees-Mogg openly flaunts the opportunities he has helped to create for dubious financial deals, the profits from which he stashes away in overseas tax havens until such time as this Government provides similar facilities for the ultra-rich within the country. Having promised that food standards would not be compromised in the search for trade deals toreplace those within the EU, Parliament then votes to remove all such protection to appease the United States.As for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings, words fail me. His complete disregard for the letter and spirit of the emergency measures, is beyond belief.What is also surprising, in a smaller way, is that you chose to devote half a page to Mr Stevensons nonsense.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IT is becoming abundantly clear with each passing day that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos calculated decision to \"grandstand\" her position as First Minister by trailing Englandrsquos easing of the Corona lockdown in order for Scotland \"to go its own way\" is beginning to backfire on her ndash indeed, Struan Stevenson astutely sees through her lame excuses that she is not playing politics .Also, the SNPrsquos request for Westminster to extend the furlough scheme beyond October for Scotland has been essentially denied, piling pressure on the First Minister to catch up with England in respect of lockdown easing.Now, instead of being perceived as leading from the front, increasingly, Ms Sturgeon is going to be perceived as passively following from behind ndash not a good track-record for entering the  Holyrood elections.Philip Adams, Crosslee.I WAS going to sit down and compose a y, erudite response to Struan Stevensons interesting take on the Scottish Governments proposed road map. Then I read your leader columnand put my pen away.Alastair Clark, Stranraer.STRUAN Stevenson has a good go at the Scottish Government. Fine, thats what Tories do, but I must comment on his sign-off, \"Historically, pandemics either ended with the medical containment of the disease, which in our case could occur with the development of a vaccine, or they end when society loses its fear of the virus\"He suggests that since a vaccine is a long way off, \"its time we lost our fear\".Grand, there are three ways to do this.First, be immune. Secondly, die of the virus. Or of course, you could go the third way, and thats to be so rich and isolated from real le, as it is lived by most of the rest of us, that you are not affected by it, nor do you have to give a hoot.AJ Clarence, Prestwick.I THINK I am a reasonably tolerant man. I very rarely lose my temper. But I am enraged by Dominic Cummingss behaviour. How dare he  The lockdown instructions were very clear, despite the weasel words of the deputy English Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries. She knows that she dare not say anything against her masters for fear of losing her job.Everyone and their auntie knows that he did the wrong thing. Trying to excuse it on a technicality just makes it worse. Then we are told it was because he was concerned for his four-year-old son. Really  Did he not have any other options open to him  Does he not have any friends who live locally  I suppose not. But whose fault is that Why should I or anyone  follow Matt Hancocks instruction  Ill tell you why. Because it raises the risk to others.Robin Mather, Musselburgh.DOMINIC Cummings ndash the perfect example of the adage dont do as I do, do as I tell you.Dave Biggart, Kilmacolm.INTERESTING that despite reasonably positive public opinion of Nicola Sturgeons handling of the pandemic in Scotland, there were three negative letters in The Herald . The performance of the Scottish Government has certainly not been flawless, but the criticism, to paraphrase Mr James Martin, is pathetic.First, Ms Sturgeon would have been severely criticisedshe had erged from the UK at the beginning of the outbreak, and the UK was slow. Secondly, as a retired clinician, I disagree with retired NHS manager Danny Crawford about patient confidentiality. It was, presumably, suggested by clinicians and accepted by the First Minister. It may be a moot point, but I would side with that view. If there was poor contact tracing, that needs to be avoided in the future.Finally, I get the impression that whatever Ms Sturgeon and the current Scottish Government do, these correspondents and their ilk will find a reason to criticise. R McMurtrie talks about Ms Sturgeons empathy, but many would consider hers as genuine concern for others. Would he prefer Boris Johnsons or Priti Patels form of \"empathy\" George Rhind, Clydebank.UNTIL now, according to the UK Government daily reports, approximately three million people in England have been tested for Covid-. On a pro rata basis that could mean that we have tested approximately , people in Scotland. However, any figures I have heard do not at all approach this figure.I accept that, as the First Minister says, testing is not the silver bullet, but as it is being touted strongly by the World Health Organisation, surely we should be maximising our efforts in this regard and letting the Scottish people know the results.W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.THE proposedof golf to being one of our permitted activities has been greeted with a fanfare. Further along the Scottish Governments route map, we are advised to drive no more than five miles.The authors of this document are obviously unaware of the fact that many golfers live as many as  or more miles from their clubs.

To mark the forthcoming Channel  remake of All Creatures Great and Small, BBC showed a couple of old episodes of the Sunday night drama, plus a documentary about its popularity.In two shakes of a lambrsquos tail we were back in trsquoYorkshire Dales with unassuming James Herriot, shouty Siegfried and his naughty little brother Tristan, plus Mrs Pumphreyrsquos Tricki-Woo .It was all a universe away from Noel Fitzpatrick, aka Channel rsquos The Supervet. The James Herriot of the noughties is a pioneering orthopaedic-neuro veterinary surgeon forever pushing the boundaries of possibility. ldquoCutting edge in All Creatures Great and Small, in contrast, was someone donning a rubber glove before inserting an arm into a cowrsquos backside.Think, then, of Scottish Vets Down Under, a new -part documentary series, as a pleasant middle ground between homely All Creatures and shiny, high-tech The Supervet.Made by the Aussie firm WildBear Entertainment for BBC Scotland, it was a true story of two young vets who met  years ago at university and became best pals.Dr Chris Ellison was the tall one who specialised in small animals, while Dr Mike Whiteford was the short stop who ran an equine hospital.The voiceover introduced them as two Scottish vets who had ldquoturned their lives upside down and set out on an adventure of a letime, which made it sound as though they were newly arrived.As we learned later, Dr Mike went out  years ago, with Dr Chris following. Both had successful practices in the rural town of Bendingo. It would have been more dramaticthey had just been starting out, but you canrsquot have everything.As it was, the thrills in Scottish Vets Down Under were of the small-scale, animal-centred iety. That was fine by me, as was Drs Mike and Chris being ordinary, unassuming guys rather than the dreaded ldquocharacters so many reality television series seek. Uncomplicated was good. It was dferent. Whether we will still be feeling that way a few more episodes in, who knows.First client through the door of Bendingo Animal Hospital was a wedge-tailed eagle found lying on its stomach in a paddock. With a wing-span of . metres, these birds can down a kangaroo. Dr Chris, wisely, sent the bird for a snooze while he examined him. While doing so he found out that ldquohe was in fact a ldquoshe.There were no breaks in the wings, which left the possibility of poisoning. Only thing for it was to wait and hope.Arriving at Dr Mikersquos was a week old foal that had run into a metal fence. A facial injury would be bad news for any creature, but especially one set to be a racehorse. After an op by Dr Mike and his fiancee Dr Sarah Jalim, it was a bandage round the nose for the foal. Another case of wait and see.Easier in one way was the case of Clive the dog. Clive, -years-young, had terrible earache. He wouldnrsquot let his beloved owner, Kay, near his lug. Like the wedge-tailed eagle, Clive was sent on a snooze.The problem was a small grass seed wedged in his ear. ldquoLike little daggers, said Chrisrsquos fiance, Dr Claire. She plucked out the one in the ear, plus several more on his coat, and delivered him back into the arms of Kay, who gave a loud sigh of relief.Otherwise, the chaps meet a koala and learned how to do a ldquokoala bellow. Fun fact: koalas have three fingers and two thumbs. Not so fun fact: they suffer from chlamydia a lot. The boys also stopped to check out an injured hedgehog , released the eagleand checked on the foal .Happy outcomes.

Rather than engage with people as thinking, intelligent citizens, with big political ideals and arguments, this micro-politics focused on the minutiae of everyday le and attempted, as the name suggests, to change our behaviour.More akin to a relationship between a parent and child rather than between political representatives and citizens, the politics of behaviour promotes policies, with the help of ldquoexperts, that attempt to ldquonudge us here and there, to ensure we ldquobehave responsibly.The newer assemblies, the Scottish Parliament being a leading example, have adopted the politics of behaviour with a particular zeal, attempting through a iety of new laws, taxes and initiatives, to regulate how we smoke, drink, talk, and even how we raise our children.The distrusting and infantilising nature of the politics of behaviour helps to explain some of the more patronising and irrational policies adopted during the lockdown and also helps to explain why Scotland is more backwards when it comes to freeing up society.What is called an ldquoenabling state finds the idea of free iniduals who ldquoact, rather than merely ldquobehaving dficult to comprehend.

What utter garbage. Cummings is loaded, hersquos married to a baronetrsquos daughter and Johnson wasnrsquot just born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he swallowed the whole canteen of cutlery.They are the elite ndash they sneer at people like you and me ndash only now theyrsquore finally showing you just how the elite behaves. Itrsquos not merely about lsquoone rule for you and one rule for mersquo. Itrsquos the utter immorality, the swaggering, dangerous, screw-you arrogance of the pair.Cummings actively doesnrsquot care what anyone thinks. And Johnson is so sociopathically narcissistic that the idea that the rest of us have feelings or needs or moral beliefs doesnrsquot penetrate his painstakingly disarranged hair-do.Your mother might be dying in a care home, your son might be languishing in a bedsit alone, you might be desperate to see them but to hell with you, what do you matter  Yoursquore not Dom, yoursquore not Boris.Why should Dom and Boris follow the same rules as you  Yoursquore you, theyrsquore them. Yoursquore not equal. Rules are for little guys. Shut up, sit down hellip let the idiots in Downing Street do the thinking.Andthe peasants revolt and start copying their masters ndash breaking lockdown, driving about the country, journeying to relatives while sweating and coughing up virus ndash well, therersquos laws for people like that. And maybe a bit of herd immunity will sort them out into the bargain.Cummings can flout rules which were written to keep people alive, and then sneer at the public and the press for having the temerity to question him.Whatrsquos truly disgusting about the whole affair and Johnsonrsquos defence of his charismatically-challenged Asda Price Rasputin, is the use of the Cummingsrsquo child. Every single one of us has fretted over our children these last few months. Many of us have cried for our children.With Coronavirus affecting his we and then him, Cummings says he needed childcare for his son. Downing Street thought dragging the child into the public spotlight as an excuse would keep the peasants quiet. His lordshiprsquos child needed love and attention - surely, the oiks would understand that, eventheir own brats were mewling at home.ldquoThe kid is the trump card, one Downing Street source said of the Defend Dom strategy.Well, that backfired. To paraphrase the PM, Johnson has spaffed his premiership up the wall. Therersquos no coming ndash forgive the terrible pun ndash back from this. When you tell the British people itrsquos okaythey pine and suffer, but not okay for one of the gang, then even in this ided, dysal country, yoursquove got nowhere to go but into the pages of history as Britainrsquos greatest political failure.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full. Exceptionally, requests for a loan period of up to  years may be considered.Businesses can find guidance and check the criteria for funding here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-Loan-Guide and,eligible, apply online here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-LoanThose that are unsure about their eligibility should contact the Council’s economic development team for advice at economic.development@orkney.gov.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

Hatston will be open from .am to .pm and Garson from .am to .am. Both will be closed between .pm and .pm.Andrew Drever, vice-chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We thank folk for their patience while our sites were closed, as we waited for national advice on essential travel in Scotland to change.“I hope people will welcome the step-by-step approach we are taking to opening the sites again and understand the need for them to operate dferently to the way they did before the pandemic.“This is to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to the sites. Limiting the number of cars and visitors on site at any particular time will enable social and physical distancing. We would urge those visiting to stay at least two metres away from staff and from other visitors on site.”Councillor Drever said: “Both sites are likely to be very busy for the first few days. To avoid the risk of waiting in long queues, we would ask folk to use them onlyit is absolutely necessary.“As a way to spread visits across the week, we are suggesting that you make your visit –possible – on your normal bin collection day. If your bin collection day is a Mondaywe’d suggest that you visit on a Saturday instead.”He added: “As summer approaches we know that many folk will be keen to dispose of waste from their gardens.“That’s why we are concentrating on this when the sites re-open as part of the phased approach we are taking. For the time being, no other materials can be disposed of at Hatston or Garson.”This will be kept under review and, when possible, the sites will start to take other materials as well.Decisions on opening the other HWRCs – and recycling points in the isles – will be taken at a later date as part of the phased approach the council is taking.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I was disappointed that Mr Cummings did neither.Former minister Stephen Hammond said Mr Cummings should have resigned.ldquoMy concern moving forward is the distraction this is causing at a time of national crisis and the way it is undermining confidence in the public health message, the Tory MP for Wimbledon said.ldquoPublic adherence to the rules is achieved by consent in this country and that is made much harderpeople feel it is one rule for them and another for senior Government advisers.In a statement on social media, the Conservative MP for Eastleigh Paul Holmes said that the Governmentrsquos handling of the situation had not been its ldquofinest hour.He said: ldquoThough I believe his actions were motivated solely by the desire to protect his family, I believe that Mr Cummings has made errors of judgement and I would have responded dferently given the guidance the Government has issued.ldquoI donrsquot think that the handling of this situation over the last  hours has been the Governmentrsquos finest hour and I believe that the questions posed to Mr Cummings should have been answered earlier.ldquoI have raised both my concerns and my constituentsrsquo concerns about his conduct with the Government and will continue to do so over the coming days.Conservative former minister Robert Goodwill has also called for Mr Johnson to sack Mr Cummings.The Scarborough and Whitby MP told the PA news agency: ldquoIrsquove been contacted by over  constituents who, with one or two exceptions, have been critical of Mr Cummings, and his statement yesterday has done nothing to convince them otherwise.ldquoI think that the best way for the Prime Minister, who Irsquom a massive fan of, to show hersquos in charge of the situation is to relieve himself of Mr Cummingsrsquos services.Speaking to STV News, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said that Mr Cummings should now be considering his position.Mr Carlaw said: ldquoGiven the furore, given the distraction this is, given the distraction of the Prime Minister on this issue,I were Mr Cummings I would be considering my position.copy -.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!!

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

It is so important that we support our local farmers and producers.“Ballymena Weekly Market has been operating in the town for many years and its origins date back to the s, when King Charles I stipulated a Saturday market under the terms of the sale of the land that Ballymena is built on.“The reopening of the markets will help provide a safe shopping experience and support the local economy as we move through the first tentative steps towards the easing of lockdown restrictions.”Alderman Billy Ashe MBE added: “This is a welcome development as I know many local people have been missing being able to go the markets during recent weeks and months.“I must congratulate the traders and council staff for working together to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to protect the safety of those using the markets in the borough.”Cllr Gregg McKeen said: “This is an important step in supporting our local economy during a dficult and uncertain time for all sectors.“With the correct social distancing and public health rules in place, the reopening of our outdoor weekly markets will be done safely and to the benefit of our borough.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3134145.jpg--.jpg?1590072730000\n","title":"wrightbus announces redundancies as it looks to secure its future","story":"Bus manufacturer Wrightbus has today announced a number of redundancies at its factory in Ballymena as it looks to create a stable and secure future for the company in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the tough decision has been taken to make up to  permanent employees redundant pending consultation, as well as a reduction in agency staff of up to  workers over a phased period that will be kept under review. The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

We were fortunate enough to have mummy and daddy at home with us and they didn#t die in hospital.But the sacrices we had to make, my sister couldn#t come to see them because she just had surgery to her ankle so she never got to see daddy and mummy before they died at all.When you#re Joe Bloggs and abide by the laws of the country you can#t do it.

I do worry about there being another mad outbreak in a couple of months as the rules soften.We buried a mummy and a daddy and I don#t think there#s any concept of how catastrophic their lives would bethe same thing happened to them - and I mean catastrophic.I was having lunch with my son there and I had to say to him that my head was still in a spin, nearly six weeks afterwards.Why is it that a Chief Medical Officer in Scotland had to be let go, but he stays because he#s the Prime Minister#s friend  He should be let go.Reacting to Mr Cumming#s Downing Street briefing, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his behaviour had critically undermined the Government#s public health message.For all the confusion in their approach, the Stay at Home message was not complex. No one could reasonably interpret that as giving a green light to travelling hundreds of miles to Durham and then travelling further to a beauty spot to test your eyesight, he said.This is now a test of this Conservative government. They have a simple question to answer - what is more important, saving Dominic Cummings job or saving lives  There is only one answer.He added that those separated from friends and family needed certainty their sacrices had not been made in vain.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

Photo by Peter MorrisonBy Mark BainMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt#s mid-afternoon on the end-of-May bank holiday and at the jewel in the Co Down coastline, the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea as they always have.A light dusting of dark cloud kisses the top of Slieve Donard as it towers high over Newcastle#s Donard Park.But today the cars are snaking past the entrance rather than going in to take on what would normally be a vain quest to find a parking spot.There#s a sharp breeze along the seafront, a suspicion of rain in the air, but since when has that ever put people off trying to spend their bank holiday Monday ambling along to the soundtrack of the waves rolling in, treating the kids to an ice cream or stick of rock and taking in the amusements But there#s little joy to be found in Joyland today. The shutters are firmly down.The cars pass by along the main street of the town but most don#t stop. They come, they see nothing to do, they pass on by.Perhaps they were expecting more  But in these times of lockdown, although now with slightly relaxed restrictions, all you can do is queue for an ice cream or a snack at one of the parlours open along the street.There#s a sense of desperation in the air. The families have come, desperate to entertain the children, relieved to be out of the confines of home, but they#ve found little in the way of amusement. Cyclists have a free run along the footpaths. People jog on by unimpeded.Even the front of the Newcastle Centre, which is normally lined with scores of motorcycles as leather-clad riders enjoy traditional May bank holiday runs to the coast, is barren. Only a few bikes are parked up. The rest trickle by. They have come in hope and left in disappointment that things, quite simply, aren#t how they used to be.From the bridge over the Shimna River in the heart of the town, a solitary family sit below on the sandy beach as the children play. Social distancing doesn#t matter as there#s no one to socially distance from today.Sunday, from all accounts, was a dferent story. Long queues of cars lined up to get into the town as families gathered to enjoy the clear blue skies and sunshine, despite warnings from health officials and police that they should act responsibly and reasonably over the holiday weekend.Perhaps, by Monday afternoon, word had got around that getting out of the car in one of the local seaside resorts wasn#t worth the effort.And shorn of the usual caravan owners, with the gates locked at the Mourneview park on the main road into town, there was plenty of room for the few willing to break free from home for the day to stroll around town at their leisure.And as they stretched their legs they did so under the watchful eye of the PSNI, a police car stationed outside an ice cream parlour as a reminder of the times we#re living in.Leaving town, the threatened rain starts to fall. A day that many began in the hope that some things were starting to move back towards a normal way of le hadn#t moved as much as they had wanted.

His work is currently part of collections held in Dublin, London, Poland, America, Japan and South Korea. He also has work on show at the Imperial War Museum.His postcard drawings will each have a title and explanation on the back and will be simply signed #Nicholl#.He explains: The drawings on the postcards and envelopes are based on places both of us have visited and loved.I plan to open an old phone book and stick a pin on the page and wherever it lands, that is the address I will use.I can only hope when people receive them that they don#t think, #What is this load of old crap # and throw them out.The drawings have been inspired by artwork and places he and Elaine have seen while on their regular travels through the museums of Europe.He adds: This is an unimaginable nightmare people are going through and it is the good things people are doing for one another that have moved me so much.I don#t plan to be the Bangor Banksy which is why I have put my surname on the postcards and who knows, maybe in years to come, when I am long gone, they could be worth something I will be posting them in the next few weeks andthey survive, that#s great andthey don#t, then that#s fine, too. Hopefully some people will appreciate them.When his  cards are complete, Leslie hopes to create a new collection of paintings based on the cards for an exhibition to be held when galleries are finally able to reopen.

One department may reach that limit as early as June .Mr Murphy explained that,Department of Finance was to follow the usual budget timeline, departments would simply run out of money before final budget estimates can be approved.In order to avoid this scenario, the minister brought forward a motion to allow departments to continue to spend money until detailed budget estimates can be debated later in the year.One department under increasing financial pressure is the Department for Infrastructure, in particular NI Water.Speaking in the Assembly earlier, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the water and sewerage provider is facing a funding crisis as a direct result of the Covid- pandemic.NI Water provides vital services across Northern Ireland and ensuring that is financially support is not only vital to NI Water#s future, but it is critical for protecting our communities, she said.It#s important to look at the facts. Firstly, businesses have closed due to the Covid- restrictions, leading to a funding gap in NI Water of £m. Secondly, despite the fall in business use, demand for water has increased overall during lockdown, as we are using more water at home.Sewer blockages have also increased with more wet wipes being flushed down drains and NI Water has also had to change its working practices to keep frontline workers safe. All of this means they are incurring extra costs.Ms Mallon added that NI Water has been unable to avail of the business support provided to private business by the government due to the pandemic.Months before the coronavirus outbreak took hold, NI Water was already facing financial dficulties, warning in January that it needs at least £.bn to address capacity issues and to continue providing essential water and wastewater servicesBelfast Most ReadFamily of murdered Belfast man Kieran Wylie crave justice, priest tells funeralWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyCoronavirus: Northern Ireland retail shops to get go-ahead to reopen soon#I broke no laws# - Taoiseach defends picnic with friends after public were discouraged from doing soCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Dominic Cummings defends allegations he broke lockdown rules with Durham trip,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Routines have generally been disrupted so they haven#t been getting out as much during the day. If people are working at home, there isn#t the same change of position as there would bethey were in their normal work area, such as simple things like walking to meet a colleague or going to the canteen for lunch.With that routine gone, it#s very dficult for people to exercise as normal.Health experts have long warned that people who spend long hours in front of the computer are at a higher risk of developing injuries in both the upper and lower body. Fionnuala said one key area for those working from home is ensuring their computer or laptop is always at eye level, eventhat means having it raised up on books. She added: Really,people can work from a table they should and change their position regularly. Their elbows should be at  degrees and feet flat on the floor.It#s best not to sit on a sofa when working butthere#s no alternative then use cushions to improve posture.When setting up a work station at home, people should move often and take plenty of mini-breaks so that they don#t sit for too long at any one time, be it making a cup of coffee, going to the bathroom or taking a short walk around their house or garden.Fionnuala has a similar message around staying active for the elderly or vulnerable who are shielding at this time.There are a lot of people with conditions like arthritis who will be finding their affected joints stfer because they are staying in one position for too long.If your posture is poor, your back and neck are vulnerable to injury and staying in a bad position for too long can also impact on your mood. Staying inside for too long and not being outdoors can equally affect your sleep and energy levels.A lot of the patients we are treating at the minute say that being stuck at home means they can#t get the exercise they need to help manage the symptoms of their condition.If we can get people to set things up quite well for themselves while at home and move regularly, we may prevent new problems arising further down the line and assist those with pre-existing issues who are trying to manage their symptoms.With gyms currently closed, Fionnuala said walking is the easiest and most inexpensive activity for people of all ages to do as part of their daily exercise, and she has warned against doing too much too soon when facilities reopen again, to avoid injuries.Advice, tips and tools to help you make the best choices about your health and wellbeing can be found at www.nhs.uk live-wellFionnuala#s top tips for staying well:l Move regularly in any way you can.l Try to take some exercise daily .l Check your workstation.l Connect with friends family by phone or social media.l Eat healthy, well balanced meals, stay well hydrated and get plenty of sleep.

There is always something  to strum their inner desire. When the euphoria subsides, satisfaction seeps in and before you know it, the mind starts to wander to the next target. In the case of World Record breaking father and son duo Tommy and Eoin Hughes, they are the perfect example. When the next Guinness Book of Records peels off the press, their time of four hours,  minutes and  seconds from last Octobers Frankfurt marathon will have etched their names into the realms of greatness. But they are not content with their lot, they are focussed on smashing it again, this time with a result that will warn off any would-be challengers. googletag.cmd.push By the time Tommy joined last Wednesday mornings zoom meeting he had his customary early morning -mile run done. Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

This is due to a “lack of clarity” in the liquor licensing laws. According to a report in the The , Garda Headquarters has sought legal advice on pubs delivering drinks and selling takeaway beverages from their premises and has been told that both practices do not contravene liquor licensing laws. The report stated that “as long as drinks, including poured pints, are paid for on a licensed premises they can be delivered to customers.” And it added that takeaway sales are also permitted once those buying drinks in that manner consume them more than  metres away from a pub and not in a public place. googletag.cmd.push In effect, it means that pubs can operate delivery and off-sales as an “essential service” during the lockdown, like supermarkets, pharmacies, hardware stores and some other businesses. Last week, the a case of O’Flaherty’s Pubin Buncrana made headlines as it was running the “Guinness Express”.  It was forced to half deliveries after gardaiacute called to the premises. Pints of Guinness had been wrapped in cling film for delivery purposes. At the time a spokesman for the pub complained gardaiacute were unable to tell him what laws staff had broken. Now, it has emerged that after the legal advice received in recent days, such deliveries will be possible once the drinks are paid for in advance to a person on a pub’s premises. googletag.cmd.push For the full articleSEE HERE   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

Yvonne Martin, the Director of Nursing at the hospice, had been due to retire at the end of last month after a -year career. However, instead, Yvonne is staying on at the hospice until the end of June to support her colleagues through the current crisis. This is just another example of our local healthcare workers have gone far beyond the call of duty during the ongoing pandemic. Yvonne has worked at the Foyle Hospice for  years. googletag.cmd.push She was part of the team when the Inpatient Unit at the hospices base at Culmore Road opened. She obtained her nursing qualication as a registered nurse at the Royal Victoria Hospital of Nursing and later studied at Ulster University where she attained a degree in Professional Development leading to a Postgraduate Specialist Practice and an MSc In Palliative care. As part of the Senior Management Team at the local hospice, Yvonne has full responsibility for nursing teams which include the Inpatient Unit, Day Hospice, Community Team and Clinical Services. Her job involves ensuring the smooth day-to-day running of the hospice. googletag.cmd.push Yvonne said: “It has always been an honour and privilege to work in the hospice and be part of the team providing specialist palliative and end of le care to our patients, alongside the provision of much needed support to their families and carers. It can be a very sad, emotional place to work, but we also can have a laugh despite the sadness. Foyle Hospice, as everyone knows, sits in beautul gardens so it is lovely to drive down into the hospice every day, regardless the weather, and to look out at such a lovely setting. The patients always comment on the beautul setting and views we have over the Foyle Bridge. A spokesperson for the hospice described Yvonne as an amazing woman who has been a large part of the hospice for the past  years.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.

RELATED - Paul McFlynns football team of the decade.HEADLINE – DERRY CLUB HURLING TEAM OF THE DECADEINTRO BOX It was a decade dominated by Kevin Lynchs and Slaughtneil, with the latter going on to dominate Ulster and knock the All-Ireland door with purpose last season.Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane.Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title.It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title. – Daryl McDermottBig ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts.He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out.He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts.He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember.Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. – Paddy KellyA constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year.He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following.In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup.Quiet and does his talking on the pitch. – Sean CassidyHas been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade.Has played a wing back and full back.He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence- all done with a smile on his face.Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. – Karl McKaigueKarl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming.An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart.Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better.He can also dodge forward to pick off a score. – Mark CraigMark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point.Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling. – Brian Oacuteg McGilliganBrian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch.He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg HinpheyOne of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career.He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting.One of the greats. - Chrissy McKaigueThe most decorated club hurler of a decade.Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in .He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland.He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match. – Gerald BradleyYou dont miss anything until its gone.Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch.He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit.His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say.Awesome. – Kevin HinpheyJoins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team.A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions.Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season.Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team.- Cormac ODohertyHe was born to play hurling.Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home.Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness.Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart.Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball.A natural. – Paddy HenryPaddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs.It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final.He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions.He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson. – Brendan RogersRogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack.He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal.He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match. – Seacute McGuiganThe Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene.For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where.Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters.Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.- Ruairi Convery When Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him.He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage.A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.\"More...

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

Please try again later.Submitting...Despite receiving multiple awards around the world, before Adrian McKinty started writing his latest bestseller The Chain, he was struggling to make ends meet and had decided to work as an Uber driver. Persuaded by fellow author Don Winslow to give it a final shot, Adrian started on what would later become The Chain – a terrying thriller that sees parents forced to kidnap children to save their own – for which Paramount Pictures has acquired the screen rights.Explaining how an old school teacher was the inspiration for the book the -year-old said: “I know a lot of people just think chain letters are silly, but I remember when I was a kid they scared the wits out of me. “People would say, ‘make three copies of this and send it on or your mother will die’. I thought better safe than sorry, I’ll make three copies of this and send it on.“When I was at Victoria Primary School in Carrick my P teacher was this woman called Mrs Carlisle. This was in the late s. These chain letters had been going around for a long time. She heard about it and askedanyone in the class had been getting chain letters and was really worried about it. Most of the class put their hand up. She said, ‘bring them all to me tomorrow’. “We all brought them to her, she took us outside, put them all into a bonfire and said, ‘I will take all the bad luck and all the hexes and stop these chains now’. Then she set fire to all the letters. I just remember I could not believe it. I thought, ‘well, we won’t be seeing her again’.“It made a huge impression on me as a kid when you’re so vulnerable and impressionable. “I remember any time I was away I’d always say to my mum when I got back, ‘how’s Mrs Carlisle doing ’ expecting to hear something out of The Omen, some news of a grizzly death, but no, she’s still alive, living in Trooperslane to this very day.“My mum gave her a signed copy of the book. She knows she was the big inspiration for the book.”After leaving school in NI Adrian went to Oxford University on a full scholarship to study philosophy before emigrating to the USA to become a high school English teacher. Normally Adrian’s book are set in Northern Ireland, however The Chain takes place in Boston: “I wanted it to be set in America for a couple of reasons. I wanted the main character to be able to buy a gun.“Also, the only part of America I really know well is Boston. That’s where my we is from.“I like my books to be very accurate. You want somewhere where you’re familiar with, you’ve walked the streets, you don’t make mistakes. You know the smells and the colours and the textures. You don’t want to have to Google details.”Before The Chain he was best known for his DS Sean Duffy series set in s Northern Ireland: “To me it was a no brainerI’m going to write a detective series set in the s, what do I know really well – Belfast and Carrick. I knew what was on the radio, what was on TV, what people were eating, what they were driving. For me to write about London or New York in the s I’d just be guessing.”Of the movie prospects for The Chain, Adrian said: “Whether that becomes a film or not I don’t know. Fingers crossed. One of my previous books was optioned – Dead I Well May Be – they renewed the option  times, every year for  years then they didn’t make the film.”Adrian’s books have won the Edgar Award, the Ned Kelly Award, the Anthony Award, the Barry Award and have been translated into over  languages. The Chain was recently longlisted for the Theakston Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year. He faces tough competition in four former champions Denise Mina, Chris Brookmyre, Val McDermid and Lee Child, with the public voting now open to help determine the shortlist, which will be announced on June .Asked whether sales or awards were more important, Adrian said: “I suppose ultimately it’s selling copies of the books over awards. You have to be able to make a living out of this racket. I had a few years where I was winning crime fiction awards but only selling a couple of thousands copies of my books a year.“At a dollar a book that’s about two grand a year. You just can’t live on that no harm to you.”Discussing his decision to quit writing he said: “People have said to me, ‘you should never give up your dreams, you’re a bad example’. People have gone after me a wee bit, but I feel like I gave it a good go. “For eight or nine years I dedicated myself to being a writer. The books were coming out, they were getting good reviews. “My problem was they were set in Belfast during the Troubles, that was a hard sell. People would read the back and say, ‘I’ve had enough of all that nonsense’.“Getting people in England to buy those books was really dficult. It was even worse in America. For a lot of American readers their view of Ireland is The Quiet Man. The stuff I was writing about – RUC vs the IRA, Protestants vs Catholics, bombings, shooting, raids – was really interesting to me but perplexing for American readers.”He said: “I think the break helped. It gave me a time to think about new ideas and new concepts. I started thinking about my childhood at Victoria Primary School, growing up in Carrick, and that’s where The Chain came from.”Coronavirus literatureAskedhe thinks there will soon be a wave of novels set against a backdrop of the Covid- pandemic and lockdown, Adrian said: “There’s two ways of thinking about it.“After the  epidemic , in , , Charlie Chaplin didn’t start making a lot of lockdown movies. They were basically the same films that he was making before.“You look at the writing – you have Ulyssesand The Waste Land– they weren’t about what was happening in that period.“It just could go on the same as it always has. People don’t want to think about.”He continued: “Another way of thinking about it is, it’s such an interesting topic, everybody is going through it. Somebody is going to have to write something about it.“I was thinking to myself it is actually quite interesting for a crime writer. I’ve written a few locked room mysteries in my early career.“I really like the idea of someone being murdered in a locked room, during lockdown, while everyone  is in a locked room in lockdown as well. What could be more delicious than that ”Also discussed during our interview was the idea of a serial killer at work during lockdown.Adrian said: “I remember reading a book about a serial killer during the Blitz. It was the perfect crime because so many people were being killed by bombing every night what’s another body lying on the street.“That might work for Covid too. What’s one more little old lady dead when the police are already overstretched ”Least productive timePeople who think writers will have found it easy to adopt a stay at home regime during lockdown are way off the mark according to Adrian.He said: “I haven’t really been out of the house for about six weeks, but what  can you do, you have to obey the orders, stay inside.“I’m in New York, I’ve been here about two years. Up until the last six weeks it seemed like a great idea, now we’re stuck inside a tiny, wee apartment for two months it’s getting a bit claustrophobic.“It’s the funniest thing, this has probably been the least productive two months in the past  years.“Both kids are home all the time, you’re homeschooling them and helping them with their online homework and stuff like that. “They’re bored out of their minds so you’re playing Cluedo, Monopoly, and at the end of a day of really doing nothing you’re just exhausted.“I don’t really understand it to be perfectly honest. Normally I’d go to bed at about midnight or one. By  o’clock I’m just beat. Another day’s over, you go to bed, get up and it’s the same thing all over again.“It used to be I’d go out and do a really long walk every day, four days a week I’d go to the gym, go for a swim or whatever. “I’ve been doing none of that, yet I’m exhausted all the time.“For the first month I was feeling really guilty about it. I was saying to myself, ‘Adrian, you’re wasting your le, son, you should be getting up at six, getting the work done before the kids get up’. I was really beating myself up.“Then I was emailing with a whole bunch of friends and everybody was telling me the same story. They’re not getting anything done and are just really exhausted.“Somebody on Twitter posted that they’ve used this time really well, they’ve learned French. I unfollowed them immediately. The rest of us are stuffing our faces with pizza and watching TV and you’re learning French – give me a break.”He added: “When this lockdown is over the first thing I’m going to do is go to the pub, the second thing is get a haircut. I look like I’ve been living in the jungle for five years. If there’s some hipster haircut place that also sells beer I’m going there.“If you’d asked someone six months ago what they wanted to do, what their aspirations were, they’d maybe have said they want to go skiing or run a marathon. Ask me now, I want to get a pint in the pub and haircut.”Sadly for Adrian, he doesn’t think he will be able to visit home this summer: “I go home every summer to check on my mum and stay for a while. I don’t knowthat will be possible this year.”Adrian’s late father worked at Harland and Wolff while his mum worked as a secretary. He has other family members who still live in Carrick, and some further afield.He said: “It might have to be Christmas instead. I love to get back and see everyone. It’s a real shameI can’t this year.”One elf is enoughAdrian lives in New York with his we Leah and his daughters Sophie and Arwynn.Arwynn’s name is based on a Lord Of The Rings character due to the fact Adrian and his we met in the Oxford pub that author JRR Tolkien used to frequent. “When Sophie was born I wanted to call her Eowyn , but Leah wouldn’t let me. She said we’ve got one elf in the family and that’s enough. She’s named after her grandmother.”Loosehead prop for Jerusalem LionsAdrian explained how he ended up playing rugby for Jerusalem’s local rugby team when his we was there on a year’s scholarship.He recalled: It said on the scholarship that neither you or your partner is allowed to work. For the first couple of months I was just walking around the city enjoying Jerusalem, then I saw this poster for this rugby team – the Jerusalem Lions. I thought, ‘well I’m bored out of my mind here, I’ll go along to their training’.“I think a lot of them had never played rugby before because I immediately made the first team after the first training session. I spent that year playing loosehead prop for the Jerusalem Lions. We travelled all over Israel, Egypt and up into Lebanon. It was very surreal when you look back on that.”He added: “When I was playing you took your kit home with you and you got a laundry allowance to get it washed. It was about  shekels a week, that’s about £ or £. It suddenly occurred to me, ‘Adrian, you’ve attained your dream – you’re a professional rugby player’. I was playing rugby and getting paid for it.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We have also worked to reduce the overall impact of the virus by strengthening essential services, including healthcare.ldquoWe are now working towards a new recovery phase to lead us out of the pandemic but only when the conditions are right.The First Minister added: ldquoCoronavirus is not going to disappear ndash it is likely it will be with us for a long time. We will need to have some sort of restrictions in place for some time yet to continue to control the spread of the virus and reduce community transmission. This framework will help us determine what is right for Wales.ldquoThere is a long road ahead of us towards recovery to pre-pandemic levels, butwe continue to work together, I hope we will be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradualto something resembling normal le.The Welsh Government has worked closely with the rest of the UK throughout the pandemic and has shared the development of the framework with the Scottish, Northern Irish and the UK governments. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id
