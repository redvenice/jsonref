We have to persevere.\u0027While the daily protest may seem a thankless task for the numismatist, who uprooted from his Welsh home, Mr Bray has raised thousands of pounds in donations from Remain activists to sustain his comfortable lifestyle.It was revealed earlier this year he had moved into a plum Westminster townhouse opposite Jacob Rees-Mogg, after also believed to have received a handsome lump sum from Remainer plumbing mogul Charlie Mullins.After hanging up his megaphone, the activist said he would continue living in London to keep up his political work.Last year, the Guardian followed Mr Bray for a day to glimpse an insight into what his role involved.         The Welsh coin collector has become part of the landscape at Westminster\u0027s College Green, with his colourful ensemble of a grey top hat and an EU-inspired cape regularly seen lurking in front of TV cameras (Sky\u0027s Adam Boulton pictured trying to give a broadcast)It showed him regularly swamped by pro-EU campaigners who spurred him on to continue his activism.But he was also grilled by Brexiteers who would often make a dig at him, and occasionally even square up to the grandfather. One of his most memorable spats was with Theresa May\u0027s former deputy Damian Green who Mr Bray had asked how he felt about the crunch withdrawal deal vote.Mr Green refused to answer and said: \u0027No you can\u0027t, because you\u0027ve just tried to shout over an interview I\u0027ve done like you do everyone else.\u0027In a competitive field, you are the biggest w***ker.\u0027 Mr Bray continued to heckle the top Tory and said: \u0027Is that a bit of abuse this morning? Not having a good day then sir?\u0027When Mr Bray first shot on to the Westminster scene to interrupt news reports by floating behind interviewees with his anti-Brexit signs, the broadcasters forked out for raised towers to keep him out of shot.Yet this did not stop the hardline Remainer, who simply glued his signs to long poles to hoist them into view.Although some reporters are clearly annoyed by Mr Bray\u0027s loudhailer and ignore him, many acknowledge his cries with the odd smirk, or even speaking to him directly.Good Morning Britain anchor Piers Morgan, who called Mr Bray \u0027a complete moron\u0027, had a lengthy on-air exchange with him once, in which he beat the Remainer at his own game and yelled through a megaphone at him.Mr Bray, who stood unsuccessfully in the election for the Lib Dems, said: \u0027The majority of people, 53 per cent, voted for remain parties including Labour, Lib Dems, Greens and the Scottish National Party. That\u0027s 1.2 million more people who wanted to remain than leave.\u0027He added: \u0027I don\u0027t blame those people that voted to leave after being promised the earth, but the sad fact is that we are all going to end up in hell after Brexit happens.\u0027Every single think tank including the government sad that we are going to be worse of with any form of Brexit.\u0027We may have a high level of employment, but they are not quality jobs.

by Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University in the provincial capital of Nanjing.   Dr Sun Chao from the hospital\u0027s department of urology told Pear Video: \u0027Upon our close inspection, we were surprised to find that his bladder was full off stones.\u0027Bladder stones are hard lumps of minerals that can form inside the organ when it\u0027s not completely empty of urine, the NHS states.Surgery is often needed to remove the stones, with lasers or stone-crushing devices used to break them up before they are taken out.         Dr Sun Chao (pictured), who treated the man, said his condition was likely to have been caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate         The medic said the patient had suffered from BPH for more than 10 years without treatmentAccording to Dr Sun, the elderly patient has suffered from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for over a decade, which has made it difficult for him to urinate.He said the patient had never sought medical attention properly for the condition. BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate, a walnut-sized gland below the bladder. Its main job is to make fluid for semen.The cause of the condition - which affects around half of men in their 50s and up to 90 per cent of those over 80 - is not fully understood, though one theory is that, as men age, their testosterone levels drop, triggering the growth of prostate cells.          BPH affects around half of men in their 50s and up to 90 per cent of those over 80Dr Sun told Nanjing Daily that Mr Liu\u0027s stones were likely to have been caused by his BPH, combined with the fact that he has Hyperuricemia - a high level of uric acid in one\u0027s blood. Another contributing factor was that Mr Liu did not like drinking water, and it sped up the formation of the stones.  \u0027I have worked in the field for more than 10 years and have never seen a case like this,\u0027 Dr Sun said.He urged middle-aged and elderly men not to ignore symptoms, such as discomfort or pain while passing urine, to prevent stones from forming."},{"url":null,"title":"Mother shoplifts 1 milkshakes child","story":" She quickly scans the fridges and the man points to something inside.

In a ided party, there is always a danger that factions will overcome facts or, with a compromise candidate, that triangulation will trump truth. I want to break this cycle: to use the leadership campaign as an opportunity for us all to learn from each other, and to help our party grow.That’s the first reason I’m standing: for a chance to tell the truth. With our party on the edge of a precipice, now is the time to dispel our fears and face up to reality. Anything else would mean that the millions of people who still need a Labour government, so badly, would be failed again.The truth is that to change our country, we have to change ourselves.Last week’s crushing defeat now poses two simple questions. Why did we lose? And how do we win?The truth is that despite his enormous achievements in inspiring a new generation of members, Jeremy Corbyn’s first promise as leader was never fulfilled. The party was never democratised on the scale or to the extent that members were led to expect – they were never empowered to campaign, select candidates or determine policy on the scale that was required. This must now change. We don’t need foot soldiers, we need an army of activists who think critically, treat each other with respect and have a serious democratic stake in the movement. I don’t want to manage the labour movement, I want to unleash it. That is the first route to victory.The truth is that while making a clear break with the New Labour era in terms of policy and personnel, the party was never able to communicate this to voters in our heartlands. When trying to persuade them of our radicalism and sincerity, we often had the legacy of the 2000s thrown back in our faces. Persuading voters that we understand the sources of their long-held resentment and frustration, of their disappointment in how Labour has conducted itself since the 1990s, will be the first step towards winning back their trust.The truth is that indecisiveness and triangulation on the Brexit issue saw Jeremy’s favourability ratings fall from positive to catastrophic after the June 2017 election. Such prevarication and lack of leadership must never characterise our politics again.The truth is that after Jeremy became leader, we fought two elections on an electoral system that massively favours the Conservatives, and their voter base of propertied pensioners. A majority of the British public voted for parties of the left or the liberal centre. But this was in no way reflected in the election result. Labour should have committed itself to changing the voting system decades ago, and we have condemned some parts of our country to 40 years of decline by failing to do so.But to go forward from this point we must tell the truth, not just about what went wrong, but also about what kind of society we believe in. In 2019, we offered some of the right abstractions about promoting equality and opposing austerity. But we never painted a rich and textured picture of life in the society that we proposed to build. Instead we offered a shopping list of rather disconnected policies.It’s not such lists people live their lives by, but emotions and feelings. My vision for the country is of warmth and energy. A country that starts every conversation and every project – either in business or politics – with a belief in the best in people. This is the hopeful creed of a 21st-century socialism. It is what motivates our members and our most passionate supporters. Any politics animated by such a positive vision must also be prepared to stand and fight against its enemies, those who degrade our society for their own benefit. Many of our towns have never recovered from the catastrophe of Thatcherism. Young people can’t find homes or meaningful work. Old people struggle without the care they need. None of this has happened by accident, or because of some technical error. It is the result of systematic efforts by the elite, which Boris Johnson represents, to plunder our country to their own advantage.They will seek to ide us by blaming immigrants and other vulnerable people, and we must not let them.Two forces will shape our future, and the context of the next general election: the climate crisis and the ongoing technological revolution. Both can be sources either of despair or hope. We can hide behind platitudes and denial, or we can seize these crises as opportunities to renew our country as it has not been renewed since the 1940s.Everything is down to us and how we react to these changes. Do we seek rich lives within nature’s boundaries, or the desolation that Johnson’s brand of disaster capitalism will ensure? Do we seek a connected, collaborative and more equal society or a world of perpetual surveillance and exploitation?To convincingly offer such a vision and respond to the hope and fears of climate and technology we need a different kind of party. One that is open, democratic, inquisitive and that expresses solidarity with others inside the party and outside. Labour must be the anchor of a broad movement for change.We can start to transform the party now. I don’t want to beat the other candidates I want to learn from them and with them. I want us to use this campaign to reach out to every other progressive force in the country – parties, campaigns and movements – for the biggest conversation possible about how, together, we can change our country for the better. Nothing else will do.Even at this dark hour, as Labour suffers its own Dunkirk, as retreat is forced on us, I’m an optimist. And my hope is founded in the unshakable belief I have in all of us. People are amazing. Given the support, care and time we can do incredible things. Our job, in the words of Raymond Williams, is “to make hope possible, not despair convincing”. Labour can and must offer hope: not the falsehood that it will do everything, but the real promise that it can help us help each other.• Clive Lewis is Labour MP for Norwich South and shadow minister for sustainable economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68637f5d8d0fe39d21e4fd620f42a4843e8e32cc/0_91_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f4f12de4d74706e9954ee0069e19c72","title":"labour working class voters brexit","story":"British politics post-Brexit will be no kinder to a party that has taken supporters for granted, particularly in the northIs the Labour party dying? It’s a question that commentators have asked since the devastating election defeat last week. But in fact, as a party of working-class self-representation, Labour is already dead.Throughout much of the 20th century, there were parts of northern England where jobs came with firm expectations about Labour party membership. Labour, the unions and the nonconformist churches were the great social institutions of 20th-century working-class politics. Secularisation in the 1960s saw the decline in the role of the church. Then the unions were dismantled in the 1980s. Now the Labour party, as we once knew it, is gone. Constituencies that had been held by Labour almost since the modern two-party system was born – such as Don Valley and Wakefield – have voted in the Tories.Change does not happen overnight. The roots of the present defeat take us back several decades. Labour’s dramatic victory of 1997 was built upon a shift in the composition of the Labour vote: more middle class, more concentrated in the home counties. In the 2000s, Ukip’s rise was widely seen as a threat to the Tory vote. But as Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin documented so well in Revolt on the Right, Ukip was also starting to erode the working-class Labour vote. It shifted from its origins as an anti-EU party, criticising instead the government’s commitment to an open labour market and its embrace of EU free movement rules. Lacking real debate within Labour, the immigration issue became a symbolic one for voters, exemplifying the detachment of the London leadership from grassroot concerns.Ideologically, Corbynism was a break from New Labour centrism but sociologically, it was more Blairite than Tony Blair. As the Labour MP Jon Cruddas has argued, the Corbyn revolution in the Labour party has narrowed its social base even further, making it the party of young, middle-class southerners, popular in London and some prosperous university towns.A final nail in Labour’s coffin has been Scotland where, for different but not unrelated reasons, the party has lost almost all its seats. The collapse of the Scottish Labour vote over the past decade is one of the great electoral shifts in recent times, making the geographic retrenchment of the party’s vote in England all the more damaging.The Labour party grandees currently reflecting on why the 2019 election went so wrong have been quick to blame Brexit. This is too easy. Brexit was both catalyst and cause. The Labour party’s response to the 2016 referendum reflected the sociological changes already under way at the heart of the Labour movement. Labour leave voters were concentrated in those parts of the country that were of little interest to many of the activists driving the party forwards.Inevitably, this lack of interest was reflected in how the party responded to Brexit. Some – including Jeremy Corbyn himself – were sympathetic to an old-school left Euroscepticism of the kind articulated by Tony Benn. But that tradition has died within the party. Much of the party leadership and its membership believed that Brexit was evidence of working-class xenophobia and a general ignorance of all things EU-related.There were some MPs, such as Caroline Flint, who warned against this and stood out as Labour defenders of the referendum result. But after a protracted struggle, ardent Labour remainers succeeded in making a second referendum a party promise. After three years of leave supporters being dismissed as racist and stupid, and seeing Labour eventually get off the fence and back the People’s Vote campaign, how on earth did the party expect its leave supporters to react?Brexit was also a cause in its own right. It pitted a dogged commitment to the politics of democratic consent against an ideologically charged promise of socialism in one country but at the cost of negotiating a softer Brexit and rerunning the EU referendum.For leavers, Brexit has always been about more than just policies. Membership of the EU denoted a fundamental change in society – a movement from being a nation state to being a member state. Governments increasingly seemed to be getting their legitimacy and sense of purpose not from their voters but from their association with other governments across Europe. Over time, a gap opened up between politicians and voters. Many people felt as if it didn’t matter who they put in Downing Street – they still had little say over the country’s governing structures or the most important decisions that shape society.The current Labour leadership was often portrayed as dogmatic Marxists but on Brexit they demonstrated an incredible willingness to compromise on the question of rule by democratic consent. Because of what Brexit meant to them, voters were far less willing to compromise. When Theresa May first brought her withdrawal agreement to the House of Commons, the near-unanimous response by the British left was to reject her deal. Labour’s fate would have been very different had the policy instead been to accept the result of the 2016 vote, support her deal and then push for a post-Brexit election.British politics post-Brexit will not be any kinder to Labour. With the social structures of Labourism in the north of England and in Scotland now in terminal decline, there is every possibility that the Tories will hold on to the new seats they won last week.As an indication of what may lie ahead for Labour, it is worth looking across the Channel.

Not just for its immediate consequences, which have been graphic over the past week as Jeremy Corbyn’s messy but transformative four-year leadership has been reduced by his critics to a single bad election campaign. But also for the longer term ways in which such a defeat can be deployed: to attack leftwing politicians in general, close off leftwing policy options, and ultimately deny the Labour left’s right to exist. The left rarely gets to run the party and so is all the more castigated when it fails to capitalise on the opportunity.On election night, the former New Labour minister Alan Johnson began this familiar ritual – describing the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, which has 40,000 members, as “this little cult”. “I want them out of the party,” he said on ITV. “Go back to your student politics.”It was a powerful intervention, widely noted by the rest of the media. Johnson, like quite a few other leading New Labour figures, had once been on the radical left himself. Before becoming an MP “I did consider myself to be a Marxist”, he confessed to the New Statesman in 2004. Yet in the view of New Labour’s still vocal grandees, their descendants in today’s party, and most political journalists, such attachments are just youthful indiscretions. Grownup Labour politics is centrist. And whenever the party breaks that rule, disaster follows.Until last week the main evidence for this conviction was the general election of 1983, cited again by Tony Blair on Wednesday in a speech attacking Corbyn’s leadership. In that campaign Labour, led by Michael Foot, offered voters a leftwing manifesto, and was crushed by the Conservatives – who went on to govern for 14 more years. Labour eventually returned to power, it has long been argued, only because it abandoned its radical policies and marginalised those in the party who had come up with them. After last week’s disaster, say Corbyn’s critics, Labour should do the same.Yet there are big differences as well as similarities between the party’s defeats in 1983 and 2019. These differences tell us important things about the state of the party now, and about its prospects. But unless the Labour left persuades others that this election was not simply 1983 revisited, it risks again being ostracised for decades, to the detriment of the party as a whole.And unlike Foot, Corbyn won the support of a cohort of voters that will only become more important. According to the Conservative pollster Michael Ashcroft, last week Labour received almost three times as many votes from the under-35s as the Tories. In 1983, the Tories led Labour comfortably in this group. Then, Margaret Thatcher’s party often seemed more modern than Labour, offering a vision of an inidualistic, competitive country, which many young people liked. There was an intellectual ferment on the right, which for years had been producing fresh policy ideas.Few people would say these things about the Tories now. In 2019, their almost content-free manifesto, and massive reliance on older voters, were highly effective as election tactics. Yet, like the airy promises to increase state spending in today’s Queen’s speech, they are also signs of a party with questionable long-term prospects. By contrast, Labour’s youthful support, and policies addressing what are by common consent the biggest contemporary issues – the climate emergency, the inadequacies of the modern economy and Britain’s proliferating social crises – suggest a party with the potential to do much better at future elections.And even some of the similarities between 1983 and 2019 are less terrifying for the left than many think. In both contests, Labour struggled against an unexpected surge of nationalism that swept up many of its traditional voters: the triumphalist aftermath of the 1982 Falklands war and the 2016 vote for Brexit. Such episodes aren’t that common, despite the best efforts of the tabloids, and their electoral effects don’t usually last. In 1983 the Tories drew level with Labour among working-class voters, but by the next election Labour was well ahead once more. With Brexit likely to fade as an issue, and given the failures of past Tory governments to do much for the working class, it’s not hard to see a similar process happening again.In a democracy as prone to changing its mind as Britain, political settlements and orthodoxies never last for ever. Even the view that Labour’s 1983 manifesto was completely misjudged looks less convincing now. Foot’s proposals for tighter controls on banking and a less militaristic foreign policy may have been “suicide”, as the left-bashing Labour MP Gerald Kaufman famously described it, when put before the jingoistic, increasingly materialistic electorate of the early 1980s. Yet, given the way the Iraq war and financial crisis destroyed New Labour’s credibility in government, perhaps his manifesto wasn’t so naive after all.In the 80s, one of Labour’s biggest electoral problems was that it often performed poorly in London. In 1983 it won only 26 London seats, less than half the Tories’ total. Yet Corbyn’s election to parliament that year as a scrawny young radical was an early sign that Labour would come to dominate the capital. Despite the fact that London has become ever more central to British life since, Labour’s strength in the city – its total of 49 MPs there was unchanged by last week’s election – is now presented by the party’s critics as a weakness.Labour’s regeneration after 1983 made little use of its London MPs, and instead revolved around clever young centrists with northern constituencies – such as Blair, who won Sedgefield for the first time in 1983. This approach eventually worked, with much help during the 90s from John Major’s hapless Tory government but it didn’t create a lasting ascendancy. New Labour’s vote dropped successively in 2001, 2005 and 2010. And last Thursday Sedgefield, like many of New Labour’s former northern strongholds, elected a Tory MP. After last week Labour could look for a different path to recovery, acknowledging that the left of the party, for all its failures this time, understands the modern world and the emerging electorate in ways that centrists, at least so far, do not. Yet if the party is too busy blaming the left for everything, this route to power will not be found.• Andy Beckett is a  columnist and author of Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/360ca95ec367b442e8be8145005dba1038623ec5/0_188_5290_3174/master/5290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2584ec99f0e596d523be3281f3171200","title":"the guardian view on the queens speech glitter but no gold","story":"A mere nine weeks have separated the previous Queen’s speech from the one that was delivered by the monarch on Thursday from the throne at Westminster. Boris Johnson’s government was the author of both, and parliament has barely had time to sit during the gap in between. So it might have been reasonable to assume that the two speeches – each of which sets out a Johnson government’s legislative agenda – contained fundamentally the same programme. In fact they were significantly different.The difference is explained by one thing: the result of the general election in between. The October speech was a political stunt launched in defiance of a ided parliament, designed to force the issue of Brexit so that Britain could leave the EU by 31 October. Its object was to cast critics of the government’s Brexit strategy as blockers and wreckers. It contained nothing concrete about fundamental subjects such as social care and climate change. It was a disgrace.This week’s speech can certainly not be described as gimmick-free. Large parts of it are also constructed around vague generalities which have not yet hardened into legislative plans. But it is far heavier on substance and strategy than its predecessor. This all reflects Mr Johnson’s emphatic election victory and his working majority. These have opened up new priorities as well as some of the old ones, and now he has the votes to deliver.Brexit remains the top item of Mr Johnson’s business, now as before. It was the first item in the new speech and it was followed, on Thursday afternoon, by the re-presentation of the government’s withdrawal agreement bill, which received a formal first reading. It gets its second reading on Friday. This procedural rush sets a very bad precedent. Bills are normally published at least 10 days before second reading, and for good reason. They ought to be studied before they are discussed. The new bill deals with the most major issue facing Britain. Proper parliamentary process should have been followed. There could be no clearer sign of the government’s intention to teach parliament a lesson and to clip MPs’ wings than this.Everything in the Queen’s speech is focused on two complementary messages. First, that the Brexit gridlock of the last parliament is over and second, that Mr Johnson’s domestic priority is the post-Brexit needs of the areas captured from Labour last week. But Brexit is not over. And the detail of the bills foreshadowed this week remains to be held up to the light – not least on immigration, employment and the environment. Nevertheless, the speech’s main theme, that prosperity must be redistributed across the country, is right. Its focus on the NHS, infrastructural investment, schools, social care and fighting crime points the way clearly enough.Mr Johnson underscored some of this in his own speech later. But he did so in a boastful and hyperbolic posh-boy address, full of grating claims to head a people’s government and silly promises of a new golden age. It was understandable in some ways, but deeply ill-advised in others. Optimism and Jeremy Corbyn have helped Mr Johnson get where he is today. He now also needs to remember that he is not much trusted, even now, by many who voted for him. Confidence must be earned. He must also recognise the challenge from Scotland, underlined by Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday, which cannot just be met with snobbish insults. Mr Johnson needs to deliver. The Queen’s speech suggests he aims to do that. But the prime minister’s own speech shows he faces an uphill battle, not least against himself, if he is to do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

But to succeed, he needed the communityMost people would imagine I live in the countryside on a farm, but actually I live in a city Orlando, Florida, a few miles from the centre. When I arrived here, I didn’t own any land, so in order to grow my food I met people in the neighbourhood and turned their lawns into gardens and shared the bounty of food with them. I’m a big believer in the philosophy “grow food, not lawns”.I also needed a place to live for my two-year stay in Orlando and I also found this through the local community. I put the message out that I was looking for someone with an unused backyard who could benefit from my being on the property. After a short search I found Lisa, a woman in her early 60’s with a lifelong dream of living more sustainably. I built a 100 sq ft tiny house in her backyard and in exchange I turned her entire front yard into a garden, set up rainwater harvesting, composting and grew her fresh produce. Together, we helped meet each other’s basic needs through an exchange, rather than using money.As well as expecting me to live on a farm, most people would probably presume that I had some serious gardening experience to launch this kind of project. On the contrary, previously I had tended just a few small raised beds, growing greens, herbs and tomatoes.For the past six years I had spent much of my life on the road and as much as I wished to grow my own food, I had never made it happen. I gave myself just six months of preparation from the time I landed in Orlando to the start of the year when I would buy no food. That was wishful thinking, but just four months behind schedule I was ready to e into the deep end and forgo all food from the industrial food system for the entire year. Although this specific project was new, it was not the first time that I had become totally immersed in my food. In 2011 I was living a pretty typical consumeristic life. I never thought about where my food came from until, through watching documentaries and reading, I woke up to the fact that I was consuming the planet I loved with every bite I took.I vowed to change my eating habits and to inspire others to do so as well. Over the next year I grew over 100 different foods in my gardens. This included dozens of different greens packed with nutrients, sweet potatoes for my caloric needs, delicious fruits like papayas and bananas, veggies like pumpkins, carrots, beans and beets and herbs and peppers to flavour all of my meals. I raised bees so I could have my own candy shop right at home.Around half of my food came from my garden and the other half was from foraging. I foraged more than 200 foods from nature. I harvested my own sea salt from the ocean, picked coconuts for a good source of fat, foraged my fruit from hundreds of trees, caught fish from lakes, rivers and the ocean, harvested mushrooms in the woods, and picked nutritious weeds from people’s yards.Fishing was not just a means of food for me, it was a way to feel connected to the land around me. I used a cast net, typically from the front of a canoe, to catch mullet, one of the most abundant and sustainable fish in Florida.Protein was one of my most difficult necessities to forage. I was having a hard time catching enough fish, and around month eight I started to become deficient in fat and protein. I remedied this by finding a few deer that had been hit by cars. Some find this to be controversial, but to me it’s just common sense to use resources that would otherwise go to waste. I know exactly how to identify how long a deer has been dead and if it’s still good. It may be hard to fathom for someone living in the city, but the details are clear to those who understand the basic signs of nature.I grew my own medicine and vitamins too, including turmeric and ginger, elderberries to make elderberry syrup to prevent colds and flu and reishi mushrooms. Dried and powdered moringa, also known as the vitamin tree, was my multivitamin when I travelled.I cooked up dozens of different healthy meals, fermented veggies to make sauerkraut and made delicious beverages like honey wine and ginger beer. I think it’s safe to say that I ate the healthiest diet of my life. I finished the year weighing the same as when I had started, and I didn’t get sick once. I trusted nature and it paid off.This project wasn’t just about growing and foraging all my food, though. It was about empowering others to grow their own food and reclaim their health. During the year I built gardens for 15 other people through my Gardens for the People programme, planted more than 200 community fruit trees, sent out more 5,000 seed packs to help people grow their own organic, healthy food and taught free gardening classes to the people in my community.Throughout the year I worked with five single-parent local families to help them grow healthy food. The programme provided its own challenges, but it was truly beautiful to see the children and their mothers connect with the land under their feet and harvest the food growing freely and abundantly in their own yards.I’ve been exploring food for nearly a decade and I believe that the globalised, industrialised food system is broken. This was my personal quest to see whether I could step away from big agriculture and grow and forage every bite of my own food. I saw that it is indeed possible. I’m not saying it’s possible for everyone. In fact, I don’t think it is possible for most of us. More importantly I don’t think it’s even necessary. The answers lie in community.I simply want others to question their food: where does it come from? How does it get to you? How did it impact the Earth, other species and the people who grew it? And if they don’t like the answers they find, I want to empower them to change the answers.This needn’t be a lonely journey. We can do this together in our communities. The solutions are here and they are delicious and nutritious and part of a happier, healthier and more sustainable life.Follow Rob on Instagram or watch more of his story here.An earlier version of this piece ran in Wicked Leeks, the magazine on sustainable food and ethical business, published by Riverford.

It is one of only three known fossil forests dating to this period and about 2-3m years older than the previously oldest known fossil forest at Gilboa, also in New York state.“These fossil forests are extremely rare,” said Chris Berry from Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences. “To really understand how trees began to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, we need to understand the ecology and habitats of the very earliest forests.”The forest would have been quite open and its ancient trees would appear alien to the modern eye. A walker would have encountered clusters of Cladoxylopsid, a 10m-tall leafless tree with a swollen base, short branches resembling sticks of celery and shallow, ribbon-like roots. The fossils also revealed a tree called Archaeopteris, something like a pine, but instead of needles the branches and trunk were adorned with fern-like fronds, giving it an almost hairy appearance. “It’s not something we can immediately recognise as a modern tree,” said Berry.Archaeopteris also featured enormous woody roots, which had not previously been seen in forests of this era.The prehistoric forest would have been sparse on wildlife. The first dinosaurs would only appear 150m years later and there were no vertebrates on land yet and no birds. The forest’s primary occupants were millipede-like creatures, called myriapods, and some other primitive insects that may or may not have begun to fly.“It’s funny to think of a forest without large animals. No birdsong. Just the wind in the trees,” said Berry.The emergence of forests is one of the most transformative events in Earth’s history, marking permanent changes to ecology, atmospheric CO2 levels and climate. Before forests, CO2 levels were far higher and the Earth’s climate was hotter with no ice caps. By the end of the Devonian period, about 350m years ago, there were glaciers and, soon after, polar ice became permanent.However, there have been so few fossil remains of early trees that scientists have had only a hazy idea of which trees dominated which habitats, how root systems altered soil chemistry and how forests opened up new ecological niches for animals.“These remarkable findings have allowed us to move away from the generalities of the importance of large plants growing in forests,” said Berry. “We are really getting a handle on the transition of the Earth to a forested planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b23795dcbe5fff78d9b680245a75d0b12a559ea/0_196_3130_1879/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=877ea07e8d397a37f504c60bf2fb1bc0","title":"conscious ethical and cruelty free a guide to the language of sustainable fashion","story":"The terminology around sustainable fashion can feel confusing. Here’s what to look out for if you want to buy betterLately, shoppers have been faced with more decisions than ever when it comes to clothing and where to buy from, but one of the biggest dilemmas comes from confusion around the language of sustainability. Of course, the information on the label can sometimes be confusing and misleading, and there’s a lot of new language to get your head around. So, here’s a handy guide to help you figure out the difference between ethical and sustainable, and why you absolutely should ask for both from all your fashion purchases.Ethical usually refers to the treatment of people. Are the workers paid a living wage? Are they given proper breaks? Is everyone of proper age? Does the company add positively to the communities in which it produces and help them to thrive? Some also use the term “ethical” to refer to cruelty-free products. Unfortunately, terms such as “ethical leather” and “faux fur” aren’t always ethical for the humans that produce them and often these products do not biodegrade easily either.Can a product using PVC really be ethical if the workers who produce the PVC get sick? The best way to figure out how ethical a brand is to see how much information it puts out about the treatment of the workers who produce its garments. Elizabeth Suzann is an excellent example of an ethical brand. It has confirmed that its lowest wage is $15 an hour (more than double the minimum wage in Nashville, Tennessee, where the business operates). If there is a brand you love and you’re curious about worker treatment, I suggest you send a message or an email and ask what the lowest wage is in its manufacturing process.Cruelty-free refers to animal welfare and whether any animals were hurt or harmed during the production of the garment. In fashion, it also means that the product contains no animal byproducts, but on beauty products it means the finished product wasn’t tested on animals. If you want an item that is free of animal byproducts in regards to beauty, you need to look for a vegan product. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the manufacturing process of the item is cruelty-free for humans (for example: faux leather and fur products). There are a number of cruelty-free leather options in development made from natural byproducts such as pineapple skin, but they aren’t yet widely available.Organic (in regards to materials) refers to natural fibres being grown and produced without the use of highly toxic materials such as chemical pesticides in the growing process. Cotton is probably the most common organic fibre you can buy, but it is also possible to find organic hemp, silk and jute, to name just a few. Organic cotton has come under criticism, however, because it requires a lot more water and irrigation than conventional cotton. However, pesticides that go into conventional cotton wreak havoc on the environment, as well as the health of humans who drink from water supplies nearby. The solution isn’t to discount organic cotton, it’s for all of us to consume less cotton in general.Conscious fashion is often used synonymously by the fashion industry with “ethical”, “sustainable” or “eco” fashion. It’s a bit of a catchall phrase that ends up being popular with brands that greenwash (see below). However, there are brands with the word “conscious” in their name (such as Conscious Clothing) where the sustainability credentials do check out, so don’t be deterred. A brand that has nothing to hide will have its sustainability record clearly displayed, as Conscious Clothing does on its website.Fair trade is a partnership that refers to marginalised producers getting a fair wage for their product when it is sold in more affluent countries. Prices for fair-trade materials must never fall below market price. Fair trade has principles such as fair payment and ensuring good working conditions, which fair trade-certified clothing producers are encouraged to follow. The problem with fair trade is that it’s not a perfect solution for regulating the fashion industry. There are multiple fair-trade websites and getting a straight answer about fair-trade fashion often feels impossible. There are other regulations for clothes, such as Global Organic Textile Standard, Cradle to Cradle or the Better Cotton Initiative, that can be more helpful when looking at sustainability and ethics in fashion, but it can often be better to research a company and learn how it operates, rather than rely on a certification. Even if a brand is awarded every certificate under the sun, it will still be a significant polluter if it is making 500 garments a minute.Slow fashion is the antithesis of fast fashion. It is high-quality garments that are designed with a long-term lifecycle in mind. In a perfect world, every item we bought would be slow fashion – but that would require us to no longer subscribe to a trend-driven market. Until the biggest fast-fashion producers in the world stop making so many garments so quickly (which, of course, means a smaller profit margin), they won’t be slow or sustainable. Instead of buying into fast-fashion, research small labels and lend your support to those that are doing things the right way. Slow-fashion brands tend to avoid being trend-driven and instead focus on classic pieces that will stand the test of time.

Although the owner does have a registered company, Chansiri Ltd, which is registered at Hillsborough, its most recent accounts state that it was dormant, not trading.Another company owned by Chansiri, Sheffield Wednesday Holdings, registered in Hong Kong, has since June 2019 been his vehicle for owning the club. The Chansiri sponsorship on the Wednesday shirt and partnership with the club is simply the owner’s surname, rather than a commercial company bearing his name, according to sources with knowledge of it.The brand name sponsor on the upper right of the club shirt, Elev8, is a clothing company owned by Chansiri, and it does manufacture the kit, the club has said. Elev8 is also planned to be an energy drink, and Chansiri has a company, Elev8 Energy Drink Ltd, registered in London’s Mayfair in August 2017, but it is understood to be not yet manufacturing an energy drink for public marketing.A third sponsor, D Taxis, whose name is on the scoreboard and other areas of Hillsborough, is not yet set up as a functioning taxi company to drive passengers around Chansiri is understood to be intending to set it up as a taxi business. A different firm, City Taxis, which does operate in Sheffield and across South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, is currently a main sponsor of the club.The English Football League is clearly aware of these sponsorships, but is understood not to be concerned about them in relation to its “profitability and sustainability” financial fair play rules, because their value is not excessive.The rules, aimed at steadying finances in a ferociously unequal, generally overspending ision, limit Championship clubs’ permitted losses to £13m per season. To protect against owners artificially covering losses by over-valued sponsorships, the rules require any connected commercial relationships to be for “fair value” – comparable to the amounts a club could earn from a commercial brand not connected to an owner.Wednesday’s most recently published accounts, for the 14 months to 31 July 2018, suggest the revenues from the three sponsorships connected to Chansiri were £1.27m, not excessive for a main partner, kit manufacturer, and scoreboard sponsor of a major club in the Championship. The club maintains the sponsorships are all for “fair value”.Chansiri, 51, whose family owns the Thai Union Frozen Group, a giant tuna and seafood processing company in Thailand, bought Wednesday in 2015 for a reported £37.5m from Milan Mandaric, and has since spent huge amounts of money trying to win promotion to the Premier League.Last month the EFL charged Wednesday with misconduct over Chansiri buying the Hillsborough ground in June this year, from the club, for £60m. That sale, and a stated £38m profit to the club from it, was included in Wednesday’s accounts, and its submission under the financial fair play rules, for the previous year, 2017-18. The profit helped turn what would otherwise have been a £35.4m loss – very substantially in excess of the permitted loss so potentially incurring a serious penalty – into a £2.6m profit.Wednesday responded to the charges this month with an emphatic statement, arguing that EFL executives authorized the sale, and that the charges are therefore invalid.“The club maintains that it consulted with the relevant executive officers of the EFL in connection with the stadium transaction and that it acted in good faith … The club is accordingly bringing its own claim against the EFL to establish that it is acting unlawfully, as well as standing ready, if necessary, to vigorously defend the charges.”A Wednesday spokesman said the club was making no further comment, and declined to comment on the connected sponsorships to Chansiri.Wednesday finished 15th in the Championship in 2017-18, despite increasing their wage bill to £42m, which along with other costs meant that they spent almost double their entire revenues of £25m. The accounts for that period state that Chansiri’s loan to the club more than doubled, from £38m in 2016-17, to £78m. In September last year Chansiri also appears to have paid £21m for new shares in the club.The accounts note that Chansiri is a director of Elev8 Clothing and Elev8 Energy Drink, and state that the total paid to the club from “related parties” was £61.27m. As he bought Hillsborough for £60m, that suggests the total from sponsors connected to him, including the name Chansiri itself, was £1.27m.Sales of a stadium to a club’s owner are allowed under EFL financial rules, despite reservations, known to be felt most strongly by the Middlesbrough owner Steve Gibson, about clubs and grounds being in separate ownership, and concerns that such sales are an artificial, one-off way of balancing the books.The EFL is understood to be conducting a review of the £60m valuation for Hillsborough, but that is separate to the misconduct charge, which relates to the timing of the sale and allocation of the £60m to the 2017-18 financial year.Wednesday’s accounts for that year were initially required to be published at Companies House by the end of February this year, but then the annual year end for the figures, 31 May 2018, was extended to 31 July 2018, meaning the accounts were for a 14 month period, and needed to be published by 30 April this year. They were not published on time, then nearly two months later on 21 June Chansiri formed a new company, Sheffield 3 Ltd, which a week later, on 28 June this year, was used to buy Hillsborough from the club. The £60m receipts were included in the 2017-18 accounts whose period had ended on 31 July 2018, 11 months earlier.The EFL said when charging Wednesday that it had undertaken a formal investigation into financial information provided by the club following the sale of Hillsborough, and “reviewed a large number of documents” as part of the process.“The EFL has … concluded there is sufficient evidence to justify issuing charges of misconduct … in respect of a number of allegations regarding the process of how and when the stadium was sold and the inclusion of the profits in the 201718 accounts,” the league said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/478b5c1af6618844307c7a49fc0e2317f0a465de/0_107_5912_3546/master/5912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8abef457ea595a601089cef01aae3676","title":"liverpool busy 24 hours manager moves and more football weekly extra podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Jonathan Liew, Faye Carruthers and Nick Ames discuss Liverpool, Ancelotti and Arteta throw some surprises, the tyranny of Big Dunc, disappearing football stands and a familiar voice down the phoneJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

It gives an insight into the workings of the organisation that produces the , the Observer, and the  editions in the US and\u0026nbspAustralia, over the last year.This has been a year of important milestones for the . We have combined dynamic, revelatory journalism with a great moment of commercial success, rebalancing the ’s finances after three years of incredibly hard work, thanks in large part to the generosity of our supporters and readers all over the world.As you’ll read in this report,  journalists have engaged deeply with the world’s most pressing issues. We have reported on the facts of the climate crisis and the young campaigners fighting for a more hopeful future – and we have changed our language to ensure we accurately describe the urgent environmental catastrophes we face. In the UK, we tracked Brexit negotiations and the general election, examining their impact on citizens with series such as People and power and Anywhere but Westminster. We shone a light on those in power, with exclusives such as Boris Johnson’s altercation with his girlfriend. Our Implant Files investigation – in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – examined the effects of lax regulation in the implants industry and another investigation showed that social housing tenants were being blocked from using communal shared playgrounds in south London.In the US, our comprehensive political coverage included clear-eyed reporting of impeachment proceedings, and analysis of the huge impact of Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policies. We examined the voters who swung to Trump and the new American left, and we launched The Fight to Vote, a year-long project about voter suppression. The Shades of Black series looked at the discrimination faced by darker-skinned black people and we revealed that anti-abortion campaigners were behind a women’s fertility app. In Australia, we covered the federal election with great commentary and analysis and our Fair Go? Series told the stories of those left behind by the two main parties. We pressed for government accountability through the Transparency Project and our Life on the Breadline series listened to the voices of Australians living in poverty. Deaths Inside tracked Indigenous deaths in custody since 1991 and we led the way in reporting the trial of Cardinal George Pell.  Our New Populism series examined the rising political movement, the use of populist rhetoric and the networks behind far-right activists. We reported as the children of an Islamic State fighter were reunited with their mother and the China Cables revealed the detention of over a million ethnic minority muslims. Our brilliant Long Reads celebrated five years of in-depth reporting. The Women’s World Cup 2019 was an enjoyable and significant event. And our film Black Sheep was nominated for an Oscar – a first for a European news organisation.We have shown that purposeful journalism can come in many forms. Today in Focus is a daily news podcast that’s a chance to go deep into a single subject each day. We’ve relaunched the 100-year-old  Weekly as a wonderfully designed international news magazine, with tailored editions for readers in Australia and the US. Accurate, painstaking, committed journalism is expensive to produce – so I am delighted that more readers support the  than ever before. Our unique ownership model means we are not controlled by a billionaire owner or shareholders demanding financial returns – all of your support helps us to invest directly in journalism. One of the most inspiring aspects of this support is that many readers don’t just send us a payment – they tell us why it is they choose to support us. Many of you have told us that you contribute precisely so that others can continue to access the journalism we provide, without a paywall. The world around us remains chaotic, and it would be easy to feel despair. But in these disorienting times, we must offer our readers hopeful journalism, which speaks to the urgency of this moment, but that lasts for more than a day. In 2019, the  announced the successful completion of its three year turnaround strategy to breakeven and respond to a challenging commercial environment. News publishers like us faced a very tough outlook. The demand for print media was – and remains – in long-term decline, and changes to online advertising were motivating many publications simply to cut costs and erect paywalls. We decided that the  ought to remain open and accessible to all, forging a strategy that placed our readers at the heart of our plans, asking them to contribute to us financially to support our mission.Many in the media were skeptical about whether our approach could succeed. But in May 2019 we not only broke even – we delivered the ’s strongest revenues in a decade, and the first operating profit for our news business for 20 years. The BBC called it “one of the most significant turnarounds in recent British media history” – and it is one we achieved thanks to our readers and to the talent and hard work of every single person in our organisation.The figures behind our break-even result tell the story of how our business has transformed itself over time.  News \u0026amp Media has grown its revenues consistently each year since 2016, while steadily reducing our costs, and fifty-six per cent of our revenues now derive from digital sources.Income from advertising is another extremely important way in which we fund our journalism. We are in a highly challenging environment in which the vast majority of advertising growth is absorbed by large technology platforms, but we have pursued a creative, modern, trustworthy approach to advertising, in line with the ’s values. While our advertising revenues have been resilient in recent years, we remain concerned about the long-term prospects for a reliable advertising income for quality publishers. is now looking ahead. We have fought hard to achieve our current financial profitability, and we are on a surer footing as a more reader-funded, more digital and more international business.We have set new ambitions, to make ourselves a more purposeful, more sustainable organisation, and to attract the support of 2 million people by 2022.News organisations will continue to face turmoil in the foreseeable future - confronting threats that are structural, political and financial and having to find new ways to sustain their revenues in line with costs.  is not exempt from this, and it remains a real challenge for us to turn a single year of financial profitability into true long-term sustainability.

Perhaps nowhere else has this been as pressing as on the issue of the climate and environment.Thousands of students around the world took to the streets to protest against the lack of political action to tackle the climate crisis. We decided to update the language we use to talk about the climate crisis, making sure that we are scientifically precise and communicating clearly. Instead of “climate change”, the preferred terms are now “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”. News organisations around the world are joining us in adopting this language – CBC, Canada’s national public broadcaster, noted that a “recent shift in style at the British newspaper the  has prompted requests to review the language we use in global warming coverage”.Ahead of the 2019 UN Climate summit in New York, we joined forces with more than 250 news organisations to launch Covering Climate Now, a global media collaboration to improve the climate story. As part of this,  US, a lead partner in the project, published a week of climate coverage including The Silenced – an investigation detailing how the Trump administration is silencing government climate scientists – and launched the Age of Extinction, a series looking at the bioersity crisis.We also published The Polluters to investigate the fossil fuel industry and the structures that support it - revealing the 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions and a terrific set of graphics comparing details of the fossil fuel firms behind a third of carbon emissions since 1965.We tracked the impact of governments’ approach to the environment, across continents. In Brazil we took a shocking journey through Bolsonaro’s Amazon inferno and the wreckage following catastrophic fires. In Australia we obtained documents that shone a light on alleged illegal land clearing. Our Global Defenders Project recorded the deaths of those who died defending the environment, in collaboration with campaign group Global Witness. It helped inspire two other major journalism collaborations investigating environmental conflict in 2019 – Green Blood and Land of Resistance - and was cited by the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, spurring a UN environment conference.Our Weekend supplement’s special climate issue featured two powerful voices on the climate crisis, the activist Greta Thunberg and US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in their first conversation, full of energy and ideas. Our Instagram audience of 2.2 million followers is highly engaged and we have collaborated with them throughout the past year, publishing their videos from the global march for climate change – a powerful way of showing unity among our audience, from South Africa to Slovenia, on the subject of the climate crisis and their demands for government action.Our New Populism series examined one of the defining political movements of our time. We reported globally on the rise of populist rhetoric among politicians, the network behind prominent far-right activists and links between anti-vaccination activists and the alt-right.We hosted a biting takedown of the Davos consensus. And nearly three years on from the global Panama Papers investigation into tax – in which the  played a leading role – more than $1.2bn of tax revenues have been publicly collected, with corruption investigations and actions in many countries. A global series, Automating Poverty, laid bare the tech revolution transforming the welfare system worldwide – while penalising the most vulnerable. And Edward Snowden, the man whose state surveillance revelations rocked the world, spoke exclusively to the  about his new life and concerns for the future.We continued to scrutinise the activities of powerful tech companies. Apple apologised for allowing contractors to listen to voice recordings of voice assistant Siri users in order to grade them and reviewed its programme, triggered by a  report revealing its existence. Our story showing how Facebook and YouTube helped spread anti-vaxxer propaganda was used by the chair of the House intelligence committee in a letter to Facebook on the topic. And we exclusively revealed how the task of moderating Facebook continues to leave psychological scars on the company’s employees.As UK politicians scrambled to pursue their Brexit agendas and then moved into a general election, we covered political developments and the experiences of British and European citizens. Our team captured the big picture and the consequences for the country as the Conservative party secured its biggest majority since 1987.As the election campaign got into gear, we had an exclusive interview with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and revealed that Tom Watson was standing down as Labour deputy leader. We showed that Tory HQ were telling their candidates not to sign pledges on the climate or the NHS and shone light on the delayed publication of a report into Russian political interference and a fresh Tory Islamophobia crisis. Our sketch writers skewered the leaders of all three main parties as they made their journeys on the campaign trail. Our People and power series talked to voters and Today in Focus in Hartlepool was complex and fascinating. The Anywhere but Westminster series criss-crossed the UK, vividly gauging the views and moods of people in British villages, towns and cities - finding election frustration and more hopeful voices too. Our Brexit: ided generations series chronicled the views of young people and we also contextualised why some people wanted to leave the EU without a deal.Our UK daily politics live blog frequently reached huge audiences, for example following the UK government’s historic 230-vote defeat and the prime minister Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament. The blog curates a lively discussion in our comments thread and engages readers – using their insights, information and analysis in the main blog as events unfold. We exclusively revealed the details of a loud altercation at the flat shared by Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds – a story followed up by every other national news outlet on their front page, for three days running. The fallout continued from the Windrush crisis – a scandal first uncovered by the  18 months ago. In September 2018, the Home Office revealed that more than 2,000 members of the Windrush generation had now been granted citizenship and promised compensation to those affected. We brought to light fresh problems caused by the government’s hostile environment approach. In April and July 2019, following sustained pressure, the government finally unveiled a compensation scheme.Our Bias in Britain series kicked off with an exclusive poll showing the everyday discrimination faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic citizens in 21st-century Britain, and connected with readers as they shared their experiences.The features series The Empty Doorway saw  Cities looking behind homelessness statistics to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. It was launched with an incredible piece of journalism on the life and death of Aimee Teese, a much-loved mum with a ‘massive, infectious laugh’.A powerful “London versus …” series examined the capital’s relationship with the rest of England and was packed with interactive graphics and impactful articles including on life expectancy in Hartlepool and London. Our film portrayal of a family in crisis, in collaboration with the charity Down to Earth, highlighted the struggle to pay for funerals in the UK. Following the film they were invited to engage with the Ministry of Justice and with MPs on improving the impact of funeral poverty.Our reporting on cuts to special educational needs funding took a subject that had been crying out for wider exposure and brought it to public prominence. Following a series of investigations, data exercises and heart-rending cases studies, the education secretary was forced to recognise the need for an urgent increase in funding. Our Behind the lines series investigated the scale, causes and consequences of the county lines phenomenon. reporting revealed that social housing tenants were being blocked from using communal shared playgrounds in south London. Outraged parents banded together, joined by politicians. After follow-up stories revealing the full extent of the problem across the capital, the mayor announced a ban on segregated play areas in London. The housing minister then announced he would ban them nationwide.  revealed evidence of dozens of British cases of breast ironing – prompting the government to promise to tackle a practice it described as child abuse and the Crown Prosecution Service to issue renewed guidance. The Implant Files investigation – in partnership with the ICIJ – looked at how lax regulation in the implants industry can have devastating effects on patients.

The team was tenacious in its reporting of the bushfires, telling the stories of those affected and revealing that the government had asked public servants not to link the fires to climate change. Booker Prize-winner Richard Flanagan wrote a powerful opinion piece on the climate disaster gripping Tasmania. We reported on the shocking mass dead fish kill in the Darling River, and followed up with a deep look at the drought in Today in Focus. And  Australia’s series The Frontline was funded by readers directly and investigated the true impact of the climate emergency, interrogating policy solutions and adaptations.In the US, we repeatedly broke news on the questionable ethics of the Trump administration. We gave clear analysis and explainer pieces on the Trump impeachment inquiry and published an illuminating new series on ‘Voters who swung to Trump’ asking whether they still back their man ahead of the 2020 election.

But we also saw evidence that those in sport would respond to wrongdoing revealed by previous  reporting: Manchester City launched a “survivors’ scheme” for victims of sexual abuse. film Black Sheep was nominated for an Oscar, the first time any European news organisation has been nominated. We took a moving personal story of racism in suburban England to the world, and showcased young British talent.Our Review supplement ran a “Protest Issue”, 200 years after the massacre at Peterloo that led to the founding of the Manchester , with author Arundhati Roy in conversation about her campaigning, and young activists on what inspires them. The issue had a great response from readers.We marked the death of Toni Morrison, who chronicled the African American experience in fiction over five decades, with a powerful print front page. Turner-prize winning artist Lubaina Himid had a fascinating three-day residency at the . Among interviews that stood out were a discussion with Sir Paul McCartney, in which he discussed his favourite photographs by his late wife Linda and a moving ‘rematch’ with former Spice Girl Mel B (who admitted she had lied during a Weekend interview four years earlier).Our piece on the four-day week showed that dozens of firms are trying out shorter working hours – and finding it’s good for workers, customers and the bottom line. It prompted many responses from businesses promising to follow suit.

Philanthropic funding supports the kind of mission-driven journalism which is a priority for the . This year, philanthropic support has enabled us to expand our reporting on the natural world, with in-depth and vital storytelling on a range of environmental issues from the global impact of intensive farming practices, to the dramatic changes taking place in our oceans, and, most recently, the global bioersity crisis. We were also pleased that support has been renewed for a long-running, award-winning series on labour exploitation and modern slavery. The Observer’s coverage of Brexit, and the clear and consistent message it has delivered on the need for a fresh vote, has set it apart from its Sunday rivals. In August 2019, we revealed that Downing Street had been secretly seeking advice on the legality of proroguing parliament. The story, despite denials by No 10, proved entirely accurate, and the events it described sparked a period of extraordinary political upheaval. In March, our coverage of the massive anti-Brexit march in London gave the Observer its biggest readership this year. Later in the year, we carried the results of a remarkable poll by BritainThinks into the mood of the country, which concluded that Britain is a ided, pessimistic and angry place – findings that were debated widely in the following days.

Regulators, too, have intervened – the US Federal Trade Commission has fined Facebook roughly $5bn – one of the largest regulatory penalties ever imposed by the US government on any company. The investigation continued to garner awards. Carole was named technology journalist of the year at the National Press Awards, and the story was declared investigation of the year. She was a finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer prize and won print and web story of the year at the Foreign Press Awards and the L’Esprit de RSF Prize at the Reporters Without Borders awards.

This year, the Observer published the first Design magazine, a beautiful, glossy publication launched in Milan to great acclaim. It’s packed with high quality features – we had one of designer Raf Simons’ first interviews since leaving the New York fashion house, on the joy of designing textiles.The New Review continued to lead the way in culture, reviews and features, with forward-looking and insightful pieces. In January, on the eve of the publication of Shoshana Zuboff’s magisterial work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Zuboff spoke to us about her chilling exposé of the business model that underpins the digital world. We published an incredibly poignant encounter between two war photographers – Don McCullin and Giles Duley, who lost three limbs to a landmine in Afghanistan. And filmmaker Shane Meadows said he would speak only once in the press about the abuse he suffered as a child, choosing to share his powerful, deeply personal account with us. Greta Thunberg answered insightful questions from readers and admirers in the New Review – including from Observer readers, climate activists such as Jane Goodall, the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and UN messenger of peace, and politicians including the leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn. She told them: “They see us as a threat because we are having an impact.”With newsrooms in New York, Washington DC and Oakland, California,  US continues to bring a global perspective to America. Over the last 12 months we have bolstered our coverage in areas that are key to our readers and covered America’s role and standing in the world, and the big issues facing communities all over the US: inequality, race and immigration, the environment, the role of technology in our lives, national security, women’s rights, the rise of the far right, gun control and more. We have presented challenging ideas and we have listened to people in the societies that we report on. We have brought in new voices on civil rights, race and the politics of inequality to add to the existing stable of opinion columnists at  US.

In addition to seeking contributions and story ideas, we invited readers to share ideas for 2019 as part of our year-end fundraising campaign. Nearly 1,000 people sent ideas – and our favourites are already under way in our newsroom. The outpouring of great ideas was matched by an outpouring of generosity. We set an ambitious goal to raise $1m in gifts from US readers to help us tell the stories of 2019 and tens of thousands of readers made contributions. ’s US business grew our revenues and, despite the difficulties facing all media organisations worldwide,  US is now profitable and contributes positively to the  as a whole.  US will continue to cover the big issues that matter in America, with ever more readers and supporters who believe in our unique perspective, our business model and our editorial purpose.In July 2018,  Australia reported its first profit, exceeding the targets set in our five-year business plan. We now have almost 100,000 supporters in Australia and reader revenue accounts for close to half of our revenue.At a time when so many organisations are shedding jobs,  Australia is expanding its newsroom, appointing eight new journalists and announcing new areas of editorial investment, including a new audio unit, a lifestyle section, more culture reporting and increased investigative reporting.Recently  Australia has secured new philanthropic funds for public interest journalism, including a grant from the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas for reporting about the Pacific. Australia created the world’s first news story written by an automated system called ReporterMate and also developed the PodEx project, winning a major Google News APAC grant to enhance the format and make it easier for publishers to drive reader support from audio content. Australia joined forces with other media players in the Australia’s Right to Know Coalition to support press freedom and proposed changes in legislation following Australian Federal Police raids on the ABC and News Corp Australia.

Our journalism seeks to have a wider, more positive contribution to society. Our values – of honesty, integrity, courage, fairness, and a sense of duty to the reader and the community – are likewise reflected in our people, culture and organisational impact.We continue to work to make the  a more inclusive, more erse place. In 2017, we set up a ersity and inclusion forum with staff from across our organisation to help raise awareness and address issues covering 10 ersity characteristics: race, religion, social background, gender, parenting, marriage, age, LGBTQ+, gender identity, and disability. In 2019, we held our first ersity and inclusion week to highlight and discuss a range of ersity and inclusion topics relating to each of these characteristics. Overall, more than 400 staff attended eight events throughout the week-long programme and we followed up a number of ideas.We provide a number of opportunities to attract people from a range of backgrounds, including our 12-month entry-level digital development scheme. We have run a work experience scheme for more than 15 years, giving iniduals from black, Asian and minority-ethnic (BAME) backgrounds and those with disabilities the chance to work at the , spending two or three weeks on editorial teams, with mentors. In 2019, we established a paid summer internship scheme with the social enterprise Creative Access, providing seven roles for interns in non-editorial departments. The scheme was aimed at young people from BAME and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The knowledge, ideas and opinions of our staff make our organisation what it is. Our employees sit on a number of forums covering topics including sustainability, remuneration, pensions, and ersity and inclusion. Our UK employee forum is made up of 15 employees, including two trade union representatives. We also take the opportunity to survey our staff each year and have seen a consistent improvement in our employee engagement scores.We have committed in our strategy to becoming more purposeful, and specifically this year to being able to measure our social and environmental impact.

In order to respond to contemporary demand, these are becoming necessary ways of approaching the industry. Times are a-changin’ for the bigger fish and things are improving on small-scale farms too.Harrison Pickervance is a fourth-generation farmer currently celebrating his family’s centenary of working the land at Roseacre Hall in Lancashire. “My great-granddad moved here one hundred years ago,” he says. “He walked all of his cows through Preston, which seems unbelievable today.”Since then, the farm has had many guises: “We’ve done a lot of different things over a hundred years – pigs, sheep, dairy, arable,” he says, “but over the last 20 years we’ve really focused on dairy farming.”It’s a family affair, with the farms run between Pickervance and his brother Thomas, as well as their mum and dad, Harry and Christine. The family’s herd has 660 cows, which are milked daily through a rotary parlour, contributing to the 5.3m pints of milk Tesco sells to its customers every day.Partnered with Tesco, all of this milk goes to the supermarket chain. Eleven years ago, the Pickervances became one of the early participants of the Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group (TSDG), an initiative that seeks to improve farming practices for each of its 600+ dairy farmer members, from the big players to small-scale local farms.One of the things TSDG is best known for is guaranteeing farmers receive a price above the cost of production, regardless of the price in-shop. “They have made it more sustainable,” says Pickervance, “by giving a fair price to farmers we’re more protected in the volatile milk market, especially since milk quotas ended in 2015.”But that’s only one side of the coin. “Where we have really improved things is in health and welfare standards,” he says.This covers everything from raising standards of locomotion scoring (assessing the cows’ walking ability) to reducing the reliance on antibiotics in treating illness by using preventative measures instead. It makes business as well as ethical sense. After all, says Pickervance, “a healthy cow is a profitable cow”.Another facet of TSDG is an environmental one – Tesco encourages farmers to reduce their carbon footprint, with rigorous reporting every year. “It makes each inidual farmer more aware of what we’re doing, and gives you a chance to benchmark against the TSDG group,” he says.Suitably motivated, the Tesco programme sets up training workshops to help farmers progress. “You try to improve yourself every year by reducing your carbon footprint. If you’re at the top you strive to stay at the top, and if you’re at the bottom you strive to improve – most farmers are very competitive.”Ultimately, though, it’s about the happiness of the animals. “We love our animals, we rear them from a day old all the way through,” says Pickervance.“Cows are massively sociable they’ve got rankings and hierarchies and are incredibly intelligent animals,” he says. “The whole idea of the farm is to make the cows as well looked-after, happy and comfortable as possible. On our farm, all the beds for the cows are deep sand bedding, which they love. They’re basically lying on a beach.”The TSDG is one of the long-term ways Tesco continues to provide support and security to British dairy farmers, paying a fair, independently set price for every pint, during periods of economic uncertainty. It’s also a way of ensuring cows on these farms are well cared for, clean and healthy, helping guarantee the best quality milk for customers.

Certainly the number of truly outstanding new recordings seemed lower than usual, and the proportion of those coming from what used to be thought of as the major labels was lower still.Opera seems to have been the most serious casualty of this reining back, and it’s hard to think of a single popular opera that received a worthwhile new recording during the year. Significant stage works, though, were still unearthed Sardanapalo, the rediscovered single act that is all that exists of Liszt’s shot at composing a grand opera in the mould of Meyerbeer, was perhaps the most important, while Pascal Dusapin’s bleak, haunting Penthesilea from 2015 clearly deserves to be performed much more widely.The year’s most significant anniversaries featured Berlioz (the 150th of his death), Offenbach and Clara Schumann (the 200ths of their birth), and all resulted in valuable new recordings – François-Xavier Roth and Les Siècles in period instrument performances of Berlioz’s Harold in Italy and Symphonie Fantastique Offenbach’s La Périchole in Palazzetto Bru Zane’s sumptuously documented French opera series, and Isata Kanneh-Mason’s survey of Schumann’s piano music.Core repertory orchestral releases of note remained few and far between.There were a couple of outstanding recordings featuring the Lucerne Festival Orchestra – a two-disc Bruckner set conducted by Claudio Abbado, which included the last performance he ever gave, and an all-Strauss album under Abbado’s Lucerne successor, Riccardo Chailly – but other celebrated orchestral partnerships proved disappointing, such as Kirill Petrenko’s low-key reading of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic, and Christian Thielemann’s bombastic Schumann cycle with the Staatskapelle Dresden. But closer to home, two important symphony series were completed – Andrew Manze’s Vaughan Williams and Martyn Brabbins’ Tippett – and maintained high standards to the end.There were plenty of smaller-scale treasures, though – glorious lieder singing from Stéphane Degout in Brahms and Schumann, a second instalment of Christian Gerhaher’s Schumann series, and exuberant Grieg from Claire Booth and Christopher Glynn. There were a wealth of exemplary piano discs, too: Lucas Debargue’s Scarlatti, Francesco Piemontesi’s Schubert, Steven Osborne and Yevgeny Sudbin’s late Beethoven and Cédric Tiberghien’s late Liszt were just a few of them. New music abounded, especially from the smaller specialist companies, led by NMC’s continuing support for British composers including Howard Skempton, David Fennessy, Erika Fox, Joanna Baillie and Sam Hayden, while two newer labels went from strength to strength – Philip Thomas’s survey of Morton Feldman’s piano music was Another Timbre’s standout release of the year, while All That Dust’s mix of CD and digital-download releases included vocal works by Cassandra Miller and an alarmingly vivid binaural recording of Stockhausen’s Kontakte.4 Christian Tetzlaff: Beethoven and Sibelius Concertos 5 András Schiff: Schubert Sonatas and Impromptus9 Holliger and Kurtág: Zwiegespräche"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f44650a5a7597c99c9f3ff1c40a1339fdb90e0/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82ac7de89a54d190a12e6ab1201641d8","title":"the ups and downs of jamie oliver","story":"Fifteen Cornwall, one of Jamie Oliver’s last UK restaurants, shut last week with 100 job losses.

Persuading voters that we understand the sources of their long-held resentment and frustration, of their disappointment in how the Labour party has conducted itself since the 1990s, will be the first step towards winning back their trust.”Lewis’s pitch places him firmly on the left of Labour and he said Corbyn had not gone far enough to democratise the party and criticised his “prevarication and lack of leadership” over Brexit.“The truth is that despite his enormous achievements in inspiring a new generation of members, Jeremy’s first promise as leader was never fulfilled,” he said. “The party was never democratised on the scale or to the extent that members were led to expect. Members were never empowered to campaign, select candidates or determine policy on the scale that was always required.“This must now change. We don’t need footsoldiers – we need an army of activists who think critically, treat each other with respect, and have a serious democratic stake in the movement.”While Lewis is not considered one of the favourites in the race to succeed Corbyn, he has already attracted support from Rachael Maskell, another shadow minister. The only other declared candidate so far is Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who launched her bid on Wednesday with a pitch that she has already “pummelled” Boris Johnson across the dispatch box and knows how to exploit his failings.Other probable candidates include Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who warned against the party veering too far to the right in response to the election, and Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who is backed by leading allies of Corbyn.Lisa Nandy, a former shadow energy secretary, has said she is thinking of a leadership bid, along with Yvette Cooper, who lost to Corbyn in 2015, Jess Phillips, the outspoken backbencher and women’s rights campaigner, and David Lammy, a former minister who led a government review into racial inequality in the criminal justice system.In his article, Lewis went on to criticise the party’s 2019 manifesto for being a “shopping-list of rather disconnected policies”. He said it offered some of the right abstractions about promoting equality and opposing austerity but “never painted a rich and textured picture of actual life in the society that we proposed to build”.Lewis also called for Labour to embrace proportional representation, which would likely necessitate working with other parties on the left in order to form a government.“The truth is that after Jeremy became leader, we fought two elections on an electoral system that massively favours the Conservatives, and their voter base of propertied pensioners,” he said. “A majority of the British public voted for parties of the left or the liberal centre. But this was in no way reflected in the election result. Labour should have committed itself to changing the voting system decades ago, and we have condemned some parts of our country to 40 years of decline by failing to do so.”He also made a pitch that it was important not to focus on beating the other candidates for the leadership, but to “learn from them and with them”. “I don’t want to manage the labour movement, I want to unleash it,” he said. “That is the first route to victory.”Lewis, who has been a key advocate of a second referendum, said his priority was setting out a positive vision but also standing against its enemies who seek to blame immigrants and other vulnerable people for problems in society.“Two forces will shape our future, and the context of the next general election: climate crisis and the ongoing technological revolution. Both can be sources either of despair or hope. We can hide behind platitudes and denial, or we can seize this crisis as an opportunity to renew our country as it has not been renewed since the 1940s,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c948805b289bf6998c3405f815bb9c9735549ecc/71_0_2478_1487/master/2478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a751e9fbcec206a049c0627aaa7cc82","title":"labour senior advisers should pay price for defeat says thornberry","story":"Leadership candidate says it is ‘sad’ that junior staff are facing layoffs while top team stay onEmily Thornberry, a candidate for the Labour leadership, has said senior advisers should pay the price for the party’s disastrous election showing, rather than the junior workers who are losing their jobs.The shadow foreign secretary, who declared her candidacy on Wednesday, called for a different approach amid anger among Labour employees that two senior figures, Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy, are still in their posts.The row over job losses later blew up in the shadow cabinet, as some senior figures raised concerns that they had not even been told in advance that some of their long-serving advisers were being offered redundancy packages by the central party.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Thornberry said she was “not naming anyone”, but she appeared to be talking about Milne and Murphy, who are both on permanent contracts with the party.“People know who it is that I’m talking about. But the truth is now we’re in a position where there is talk of redundancies amongst more junior staff … that it may be necessary for them to be made redundant,” she said. “And yet those that made the very decisions about the general election don’t seem to be under threat.”Details of the redundancy package targeting at least 20 staff can be disclosed for the first time. Those asked to leave will receive a month’s worth of pay, plus two weeks of their pay for every year of service, but would have to agree not to work for Labour for a year.A party source said the money on offer and the timing of the redundancies has led to anger and resentment. “For some, the offer will pay less than working out their notice.“Doing this just before Christmas has led to suspicions that it is being deliberately mishandled so they can destroy morale even further and force as many people out as possible.”Milne is Jeremy Corbyn’s director of communications and strategy, and Murphy was Corbyn’s chief of staff before she moved to Labour HQ to run the election campaign.Most of those who work for the leader of the opposition are on time-limited contracts while Corbyn remains leader. It is understood that Milne and Murphy were moved across to permanent contracts some months ago.An email sent by Labour’s HR director, Joe Perry, on Wednesday and subsequently leaked to the  said a “reduction in Short money through which we fund a lot of our political roles” meant changes would have to be made.Short money is funded by the taxpayer and allocated according to the party’s parliamentary strength. It was worth £8m to Labour in 2018, the party’s latest annual report showed.A Labour spokesman said: “We don’t comment on staffing matters.”Last year Milne was paid £104,000 and Murphy – a friend of the Unite leader, Len McCluskey – received £92,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fc9f5b573fd2cc1b424c63d5fba37a0c1937df/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5df84b3e8d7ad147f006155c09c76ffb 1290w","title":"the absolute state of it lowlights from the opening of parliament","story":"The prime minister looked smug, Her Majesty looked bored and the returning MPs looked on. It was all happening in the Palace of WestminsterWell, it’s been confirmed that the election was real. This week we have seen the new cohort of MPs swearing into parliament the first sitting of this government’s cabinet and, today, the Queen’s speech (her second in two months).Here are some of the highlights lowlights of the state opening of parliament. And I truly do mean state.If I got to the age of 93 and wasn’t allowed to retire, and part of my job was to read out the promises of governments that were rarely fulfilled, I don’t think I’d be a happy pup. And yet here Liz is, once again, going through this rigmarole. I hope the royal household has a good therapist and masseuse on staff. I note that Her Majesty is not in ceremonial garb. The reason given is that there wasn’t enough time before Christmas. Although Christmas is a week away and it must take all of five minutes to put the robe on, given that it is essentially just a heavy kaftan. I maintain this is a slight.At first you think this is Boris Johnson holding the Bible on which to take his parliamentary oath, and it may well be. But how can we be sure he isn’t holding a copy of his biography of Winston Churchill, possibly the only one that isn’t on a charity shop shelf? “Boris’s sweeping claims vanish in a cloud of inconvenient facts,” a New Statesman reviewer wrote of the book back in 2014 (surely not!), and is full of “cringe-making metaphors” (doesn’t sound like him!). Johnson has also written a novel, titled Seventy-Two Virgins. The less said about it the better, and, fortunately, not much has ever been said about it.Meanwhile, here is Theresa May taking her oath in the manner in which you read a menu, taking ages to decide, before a waiter comes along and all but forces you to make a choice. You then moan about it for the entire meal and pick from a friend’s plate while they quietly seethe.Despite appearances, this is not, in fact, the mass training day for Selfridges’ Santa’s grotto but the state opening of the House of Lords. The reason they are packed in like sardines is because we have 50,000 new peers, an entirely sustainable and not at all over-the-top number. We already had 19,000 peers and then we added 30,000 and that is why we have 50,000 more, you see.We welcome back to the Commons Caroline Lucas, who will hold the seat of Brighton Pavilion until it is prised from her hands. Which will probably in about five years given that’s when the world is scheduled to implode. Because apparently nobody cares about the environment. Well done, everybody!Here we have Matt Hancock arriving at the first cabinet meeting since the election, looking to the heavens and revelling in the fact he has, somehow, retained his place. This despite once responding to Johnson’s “fuck business” comment with “fuck ‘fuck business’” when running against him for leader, and spending the past few weeks getting out of a car, in the dark, in the middle of a country road to film a piece-to-iPhone-camera before getting back into a car on country road, in the dark.British politics once again having a normal one. In this case, the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, walking through the lobby. The vibe here is very much spilling out of Wetherspoons with the girls and not having realised it has been raining heavily and you have to ask a pal to lift the train on your new dress as you step over a puddle on the way out. It will get wet anyway and you’ll never be able to wear it again.Ah, here is Nicky Morgan, who said she would “not serve in a Johnson cabinet” striding towards her retained place in a Johnson cabinet, in which she has served for the past six months. She has also been elevated to the Lords (which is why she can stay in the cabinet) after stepping down as an MP. Truly, the underachiever’s overachiever.I can’t tell you how consistently sorry I feel for Larry the Downing Street cat. Larry is a civil servant, so he stays put regardless of changes at the top. He has a permanent expression of being utterly fed up, which one might say is true of all cats, but there’s fed up and then there’s hiding under a Christmas tree, just absolutely wishing everything would go away. To further add to Larry’s woes, No 10 has added the admittedly adorable addition of Dilyn the rescue dog. You may remember Dilyn from such scenes as unsuccessfully wrestling away from Johnson as he carried him into a polling booth last week.If this was a Rorschach test, I think my answer would be: absolutely unbearable tension of mutual hatred. With a side dash of Etonian smug from the guy on, ironically, the left.I have no idea why Johnson behaving like the conductor of an orchestra here, except for the fact that he must be the focus of attention at all times. The only thing remotely promising in this photograph is the green velvet suit worn by Dehenna Davison, the new MP for Bishop Auckland, who informed me via Twitter that it is from Dorothy Perkins. And that, my friends, is almost certainly the single thing I will get out of this Tory government.

Two Queen’s speeches in as many months is at least one too many. Especially when the first one was just a political stunt that was never intended to be implemented. This time the peers were voting with their feet. Just 10 Labour lords could be bothered to pull out the ermine and take up their places.There were rather more Tories, but still not enough to prevent the upper chamber from becoming an echo chamber. There’s going to be plenty of room for Nicky Morgan when she gets over her surprise at being given the peerage she knew she was getting months ago. And also for Zac Goldsmith, once the minor inconvenience of his previous non-dom tax status had been ruled out. The rewards for failure have never been higher. We now have two unelected ministers in the People’s Government. Lucky, lucky us.Even the Queen was staging her own dirty protest at having her time wasted. Hell, didn’t the government know that the last Thursday before Christmas was the day she traditionally headed off for Sandringham? This time she had given most of her retainers the day off, had dispensed with the state coach in favour of the company Rolls and just pulled on the shabby green coat that had been hanging by the door. Her face never broke from a scowl throughout. She couldn’t have made her feelings any more plain.Jeremy Corbyn was also wishing he was elsewhere. On the walk from the Commons to the Lords, Boris Johnson repeatedly tried to engage the Labour leader in small talk. Corbyn looked as if he was about to be physically sick, walking jerkily like a broken cyborg, his head fixed rigidly ahead as he steadfastly avoided any conversation. It was petty and peevish, but the best he could manage under the circumstances.Boris shrugged and smirked to himself. This was his day and nothing was going to spoil it. He was world king at last. Free to do whatever he wanted, safe in the knowledge that no one could stop him. If he wanted to decriminalise stealing a journalist’s mobile phone or offer an amnesty to anyone who was late with their child support payments, then he was free to do so. Right now, he was the supreme leader. It would take time for the people to find out that all the People’s Government could be relied on for was to let them down. And by the time they did, it would be far too late.A couple of hours later, the Commons had reconvened for the opening of the debate on the Queen’s speech. Tory Tracey Crouch kicked things off with a few good-natured panto jokes. The MPs who get asked to propose the humble address are usually those whose careers are considered to be behind them, she said. Pause. “I’d feel rather more reassured if the prime minister shouted back, ‘Oh no it isn’t!” she continued. Boris merely ignored her. You win some, you lose some.Seconding the motion, Conservative MP Eddie Hughes, made his speech without notes. He started well enough but quickly lost his audience. He complained that the previous speaker had always restricted him to two-minute slots. After this, Lindsay Hoyle will probably reckon that John Bercow had been too indulgent. “I know what you’re thinking?” Hughes said with a flourish. We all did. Shut up and sit down.None of the main contenders for the Labour leadership were in the Commons for the occasion. Nor were most of the other backbench MPs and those that were soon wished they weren’t. It can only be Corbyn’s minders that have prevented him from standing down for an interim replacement already. As each day passes, Corbyn looks increasingly miserable. His voice is listless, his existential futility almost tangible. With each sentence he utters, he further demotivates and depresses his party. Now, even the Tories consider him an irrelevance. Not even worth the effort of a heckle or an intervention. He sat down to near total silence.Then came Boris. The prime minister has been instructed to be on his best behaviour and not to gloat but he just can’t do it. After a brief attempt at “unite the nation” rhetoric – the “trust me” line has never gone down well in any of Boris’s relationships – Johnson quickly lapsed into charmless insincerity. It was so charming the way Corbyn believed the silly things he did, he exclaimed. Pity can be crueller than mockery.Johnson then just went into full-on lying mode. Forty hospitals. Tick. Fifty-thousand nurses. Tick. Get Brexit Done. Tick. The bigger the lie, the more the Tories loved him. He wanted to restore public trust in politics. Said the man who has built his whole career and campaign style on destroying it. “If you can’t trust the Daily , who can you trust?” he asked. How about a paper the prime minister hasn’t lied in.Eventually Boris got so carried away that he went for the biggest lie he could think of. He would build the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland that every civil engineer had said was technically impossible. The Tory benches went moist in a collective orgasm.This is the new present. It’s also the future. Boris Uncontained. Until it all inevitably goes hideously wrong. And then he’ll just walk away. Untouched. Untouchable. As the SNP’s Ian Blackford got up to reply, Boris merely pulled out his phone and started playing online CandyCrush with Classic Dom.

The study also included more than 2,400 non-emotional concepts – such as “quarrel” – that were used to further explore meanings and context of emotion words.The team then carried out an analysis based on multiple meanings of words.The Hawaiian word “pu’iwa” refers to both “fear” and “surprise”, suggesting a strong link between the two concepts. Other languages in the same family may have the same word for either “fear” or “surprise” and a third word, such as “unknown”, furthering the likelihood of a link between these two emotion concepts within that language family. In other languages, however, there might be no such overlaps, suggesting that fear and surprise are unrelated concepts for those speakers.The team found emotion concepts across all language families tend to be grouped together based on whether they were positive or negative and passive or energetic. Moreover, certain emotions such as grief and regret were commonly found to be linked in several different language families, with language families geographically closer showing greater similarities in meanings.Nonetheless, there were variations. For example, the link between “fear” and “surprise” in Austronesian languages like Hawaiian is not evident in Tai-Kadai languages, spoken in south-east Asia and beyond, where “surprise” sits more closely with “want” and “hope”.Jackson said the research suggested there may be no universal concepts of emotions. “People may universally have the experience of having their heart beat faster when threatened. However, there is variability in the way that we make meaning of that experience, the behaviours that we associate with the experience, and the way that we verbally communicate the experience to other people as an emotion,” he said, adding that such responses appear to be shaped by culture.However the study is based on something of a paradox. “Our results suggest that there is no single concept of “fear”, but we couldn’t have done the analysis without starting with the concept of “fear” and comparing the way that it is expressed and co-lexified in different languages,” said Jackson.But the team say dictionaries are still better than nothing. “What we are saying in this paper is not to throw out translation dictionaries instead, we are saying we can’t take them too seriously,” said Jackson.Dr Angeles Carreres, an expert in translation from Cambridge University, said dictionaries often give a false notion of equivalence, noting that even physical entities like the moon can be referred to differently – for example as masculine or feminine – reflecting a different view of the same object. History, she adds, can also shape the meaning of terms. “The word ‘nation’ is notorious for the range of different, often conflicting associations it can bring with it, dependent on a country’s, or a community’s, history.” Maja Konkolewska, a freelance PolishEnglish translator and interpreter and an associate of the Stephen Spender Trust, said she believes the emotions we feel are connected to the experiences of our ancestors.“I always struggle to translate the word ‘vulnerable’ to Polish because there is no direct equivalent,” she said. “When I listen to my grandmother’s stories about her childhood during the second world war, I wonder whether there was no space for vulnerability in Polish history.”As part of a multilingual family, Konkolewska said she finds that subtle differences in meaning for the same word in different languages are important – and useful. “My favourite English word is ‘flabbergasted’ – I love this feeling, but I can only feel it in English because it doesn’t exist in Polish,” she said.“My Lithuanian partner says that when he’s moderately angry, he can be ‘angry’ in English, but when he’s really angry, he’s ‘piktas’ in Lithuanian because, in his opinion, the accent and pronunciation of the Lithuanian word carries much more anger than saying it in English.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49867d26a21970d97d612e1f5b8fab983340824f/405_175_2801_1680/master/2801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6c918572729b7ff6be37e553207f760","title":"uk sport gb olympic medal record tokyo 2020","story":"UK Sport is “quietly confident” that the Tokyo Olympics will be the best ever for British athletes, surpassing the record-breaking medal haul of 2016.Three years ago in Rio, Team GB finished a stunning second overall in the table with 67 medals, behind only the United States, and most experts expect that to dip in 2020.However Chelsea Warr, UK Sport’s performance director, says that data from the organisation’s Sports Intelligence team shows that “bases are loaded” when it comes to British medal potential – with more sports and athletes making podiums at world championships compared to four years ago.“What is pleasing is that ahead of Rio we had 15 sports getting medals at world championships, now we’ve 22,” said Warr, who also pointed out that 123 British athletes have won world championship medals over the Tokyo Olympic cycle compared to 115 before Rio.“We’ve also had more fourth-to-eighth places this year,” she added. “In 2015 we had 188 leading into Rio, and we have 218 leading into Tokyo. So the bases are loaded. The medal potential is there. One of the things we need to work on is to optimise that group to move into the medal zone. It’s looking good. We’re quietly confident.”Warr said she expected the “experienced sports” of cycling, rowing and sailing to again lead to way but predicted that new events, such as freestyle BMX, could also spring a few welcome surprises.Among the names Warr flagged up was Charlotte Worthington, a chef before taking up freestyle BMX full-time two years’ ago, who has improved so rapidly she won a world bronze medal last month.However Warr admitted that she expected a stronger challenge from China, Japan and Australia this time around, along with Russia if it successfully appeals its ban imposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.“The international context has changed, no doubt,” she said. “There are new sports in the programme. It’s tougher. We’ve had to be more agile. But when I think about the results of this year, and I compare them to where we were in Rio at the same point … and when I put it all together with the quality of the very clever people we have and our track record, I’m quietly confident.“If you polled the sports out there, they’d say the same thing. But there’s no complacency. That’s the enemy of excellence.”In 2016 Britain became the first nation to surpass its medal total at the Olympics immediately following one that it hosted, winning 67 medals in Rio compared to 65 at London 2012. However the data company Gracenote has forecast that Britain may win as few as 42 medals in Tokyo, pushing it to fourth or fifth in the medal table depending whether Russia is allowed to compete.However Warr said she expected British athletes to kick on again after a “fantastic” 2019. “Every sport has a Tokyo-ready plan,” she said. “And all of them have been stress-tested over the last few months.”Meanwhile the new chief executive of UK Sport, Sally Munday, has praised journalists for unearthing the athlete welfare crisis in British Olympic sport during the past few yearsJess Varnish set the ball rolling by revealing before the 2016 Olympics that there was a “culture of fear” inside the velodrome, with the track cyclist also alleging that former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton had told her that she should ‚Äúget on with having a baby”. subsequently revealed a host of issues in other sports, including allegations of racism in British Bobsleigh and investigations into possible abuse in British Gymnastics and British Canoeing.However Munday insisted that UK Sport had listened and responded to some of the problems in the system. “We should welcome scrutiny,” she said. “Because we have a good system. We shouldn’t have anything to hide. I really believe our system is a great British success story. The public really care about it. And with that, comes being open to scrutiny.”Munday, who was previously a highly regarded chief executive of GB hockey, also stressed that she wanted UK Sport to be even better in the future. “It would be very easy, given the success there’s been for there to be complacency,” she said. “But everywhere I look there’s a real drive to want to get better and to give the athletes the very best chance of getting medals around their necks.“I’m very aware there are questions around things that have happened recently in the high performance system. But over the last few years UK Sport has put a lot of things in place to ensure that someone the failings in the past aren’t able to happen in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0deefef4e0cf9405486d570e9d93ad991d54af4c/0_400_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7b2956b726d2f1e41db3eab329ca1a3","title":"pippi longstocking review royal and derngate","story":"Royal and Derngate, NorthamptonAstrid Lindgren’s nine-year-old rebel is suitably anarchic and altruistic in a festive musical show that leaves you chucklingI’ve come late in life to Astrid Lindgren’s famous stories about a funny, resourceful, rebellious nine-year-old. I can see why she has influenced legions of women from Michelle Obama to Madonna and why Mike Akers, who collaborated with Sally Cookson on her productions of Peter Pan, Treasure Island and Jane Eyre, has chosen to turn these picaresque tales about a supposed pirate’s eccentric daughter into a delightful seasonal show.If Cookson is one theatrical influence, Kneehigh is clearly another, since the music is by Stu Barker who has long been their resident composer. The actors all double as instrument-playing musicians with the exception of Emily-Mae as the eponymous heroine.With her stiffly braided pigtails and parti-coloured stockings, she looks dead right. More importantly, she captures Pippi’s mix of anarchy and altruism: when a teacher presumptuously asks her how much seven and five make, she refuses to help her out if she doesn’t know, but, when someone has to be saved from a blazing building, it is Pippi who comes to the rescue. Emily-Mae also puts across Barker’s songs, which he dubs Gypsy swing, with tremendous verve.If the stories celebrate an inidual, this production by Jesse Jones and Helena Middleton is essentially democratic in that the eight-strong cast exhibit their multitasking skills. I was especially struck by Hanora Kamen, who niftily nips between a bossy teacher, a pet monkey and a punning cop, by Alex Parry as a series of pompous authority figures, and by Scott Brooks who, when he dons a pair of specs as a prissy bourgeois matron, looks alarmingly like Jacob Rees-Mogg.But the virtue of the show is that it conveys the spirit of the books and suggests that Pippi belongs in the great line of rule-breakers from the medieval Till Eulenspiegel to Richmal Crompton’s William. I came out with a smile on my face, which is fortunate since this show marks the end of a chapter in my life as a critic and allowed me to exit stage left happily chuckling.• At Royal and Derngate, Northampton, until 31 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15adeff55cb91f58071f7286272fc355ef3a0a5c/0_48_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82838c308290ad2dd53f6d06371a4e0f","title":"facebook 2020 us census misinformation ban","story":"Company to clamp down on ads that portray taking part in the census as ‘useless or meaningless’ Facebook plans to clamp down on attempts to use its services to interfere with the 2020 US census, including the posting of misleading information about when and how to participate, who can participate and what happens when people do.Facebook and other social media companies have been trying to tackle misinformation on their services, especially ahead of next year’s US presidential elections.They already have similar policies around voter suppression, banning misleading information about when and where to vote, for instance.Facebook said Thursday it will prohibit advertisements that portray taking part in the census as “useless or meaningless” or that encourage people not to participate.The company also said it will try to identify and remove misleading census posts before people see them. But it will also remove any posts it misses after the fact, using both technology and humans to spot violations. The company said it will begin enforcing the census policy in January.The census, which happens every 10 years, is crucial to determining how many representatives a state gets in Congress and which states and cities get billions of dollars in federal funding for infrastructure, healthcare, low-income programs and other projects. The results of the 2020 census also will be used to redraw electoral maps.False and inaccurate information is already circulating online about the census. For example, posts in neighborhood chat groups warned that robbers were scamming their way into people’s homes by asking to check residents’ identification for the census. That was a hoax, but it left Census Bureau officials scrambling to get the posts removed from Facebook.Facebook sometimes plays down misleading content rather than banning it outright, as it did with a faked video of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that went viral earlier this year. It can also “down rank” false or misleading posts including videos so that fewer people will see them. Such material can also be paired with factchecks produced by outside organizations, including the Associated Press.But Facebook is defining misleading census posts as a violation of its community standards and thus subject to removal.Google is also trying to prevent misinformation about the census from spreading. It set up a team to focus on preventing hoaxes and misleading information, and expanded a YouTube policy to make it clear that misinformation about the census is prohibited on the site and will be taken down.Facebook has long tried to steer clear of having to police its content, claiming it is a platform, not a publisher.But after revelations that that Russians bankrolled thousands of fake political ads during the 2016 elections, Facebook and other social networks faced intense pressure to ensure that doesn’t happen again. It tightened political ad requirements including verifying political ad buyers and archiving all political ads for the public. But many have found ways to slip through the cracks of the system.Facebook has been under fire for its policy of not factchecking political advertisements on its service, which critics say allows politicians to lie and then pay Facebook to amplify their lies. Facebook has said it wants to provide politicians with a “level playing field” for communication and not intervene when they speak, regardless of what they’re saying.But now that misleading information about the census is a violation of Facebook’s terms, such posts will be removed even if they are coming from a politician. Facebook has a similar policy against interfering with voting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e4eaa8a1628f4486aae667041702d41823e1c4/0_162_3480_2089/master/3480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d1facd3459d6b467362573d5461380","title":"how can i get better at using google search","story":"Michael struggles to find the search results he’s looking for, and would like some tips for better GooglingLast week’s column mentioned search skills. I’m sometimes on the third page of results before I get to what I was really looking for. I’m sure a few simple tips would find these results on page 1. All advice welcome. MichaelGoogle achieved its amazing popularity by de-skilling search. Suddenly, people who were not very good at searching – which is almost everyone – could get good results without entering long, complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important, based on its PageRank algorithm, and it knew which pages were most effective, because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn’t deliver what they wanted.Later, Google added personalisation based on factors such as your location, your previous searches, your visits to other websites, and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns, because your searches into physical and mental health issues, legal and social problems, relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else – or even a machine – to know.When talking about avoiding “the creepy line”, former Google boss Eric Schmidt said: “We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about.”You could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic, but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers, not pages of links.So, I can give you some search tips, but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in January 2004 – or perhaps not for as long.The easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the Advanced Search page, though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words, phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search, it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words).You can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language, region, website or domain, or to a type of file, how recently it was published and so on. Of course, nobody wants to fill in forms. However, using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below, and it’s a fallback if you forget any.Happily, many commands work on other search engines too, so skills are transferable.If you are looking for something specific, quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds, rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will, of course, ignore this, but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist, but you will get fewer or perhaps no results.Putting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect, and is useful for finding quotations, people’s names, book and film titles, or particular phrases.You can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example, The Simpsons episode, Deep Space Homer, popularised the phrase: “I for one welcome our new insect overlords”. Searching for “I for one welcome our new * overlords” finds other overlords such as aliens, cephalopods, computers, robots and squirrels.Nowadays, Google’s RankBrain is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks, even if they include “stop words” such as a, at, that, the and this. You don’t need quotation marks to search for the Force, The Who or The Smiths.However, it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don’t want than add terms that are already implied. One example is jaguar -car.Google also has a site: command that lets you limit your search to a particular website or, with a minus sign (-site:), exclude it. This command uses the site’s uniform resource locator or URL.For example, if you wanted to find something on the ’s website, you would type site:the (no space after the colon) alongside your search words.You may not need to search the whole site. For example, site:thetechnologyaskjack will search the Ask Jack posts that are online, though it doesn’t search all the ancient texts (continued on p94).There are several similar commands. For example, inurl: will search for or exclude words that appear in URLs. This is handy because many sites now pack their URLs with keywords as part of their SEO (search-engine optimisation). You can also search for intitle: to find words in titles.Web pages can include incidental references to all sorts of things, including plugs for unrelated stories. All of these will duly turn up in text searches. But if your search word is part of the URL or the title, it should be one of the page’s main topics.You can also use site: and inurl: commands to limit searches to include, or exclude, whole groups of websites. For example, either site:co.uk or inurl:co.uk will search matching UK websites, though many UK sites now have  addresses. Similarly, site:ac.uk and inurl:ac.uk will find pages from British educational institutions, while inurl:edu and site:edu will find American ones. Using inurl:ac.uk OR inurl:edu (the Boolean command must be in caps) will find pages from both. Using site:gov.uk will find British government websites, and inurl:https will search secure websites. There are lots of options for inventive searchers.Google Search can also find different types of file, using either filetype: or ext: (for file extension). These include office documents (docx, pptx, xlxs, rtf, odt, odp, odx etc) and pdf files. Results depend heavily on the topic. For example, a search for picasso filetype:pdf is more productive than one for stormzy.Make it a dateWe often want up-to-date results, particularly in technology where things that used to be true are not true any more. After you have run a search, you can use Google’s time settings to filter the results, or use new search terms. To do this, click Tools, click the down arrow next to “Any time”, and use the dropdown menu to pick a time period between “Past hour” and “Past year”.Last week, I was complaining that Google’s “freshness algorithm” could serve up lots of blog-spam, burying far more useful hits. Depending on the topic, you can use a custom time range to get less fresh but perhaps more useful results.However, custom date ranges have disappeared from mobile, the daterange: command no longer seems to work in search boxes, and “sort by date” has gone except in news searches. Instead, this year, Google introduced before: and after: commands to do the same job. For example, you could search for “Apple iPod” before:2002-05-31 after:2001-10-15 for a bit of nostalgia. The date formats are very forgiving, so one day we may all prefer it.Have you got a question?

Outside limestone buildings, sellers perch under parasols with stacks of sweet ma’moul biscuits and buckets of bright-pink pickled cauliflower, orange loquat fruits and green sour cherries.I’m being shown around by Fadi Kattan, a French Palestinian chef and hotel owner, and Nadine Baboun, co-founder of Farayek, which runs food tours of Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. Kattan tells me that the market, inaugurated in 1929, is a showcase of the best Palestinian food produce.Much of the produce is brought from nearby villages by sellers such as Um Nabil, who has worked in the market for almost four decades. She used to sell dairy products but today she brings vegetables, including boxes of fresh green chickpeas, beans and sacks of herbs. There is the chance to taste almost anything – from Um Nabil’s chunky raw garlic to makdous (tangy aubergine in olive oil with walnuts and carrots) sold at Samer Daoudi’s pickle and dairy shop, which was recently visited by Jamie Oliver.At midday, we sit down at our final stop: Afteem. The restaurant, off Manger Square, is run by a family who fled Jaffa during the period Palestinians mark as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, when the state of Israel was created and when 700,000 Palestinians were displaced. On the wall hangs a picture of Saliba Salameh, the man who established Afteem in 1948. The restaurant has since become a local institution, and alongside Salameh’s picture are photographs of dignitaries who have since visited to taste its famously light and crispy falafel. There used to be a picture of Tony Blair, says Alaa Salameh, the third generation to run the family restaurant. It had to be taken down because some British guests kept placing napkins over Blair’s head.In Manger Square, tourists are waiting to take tours of the nativity church. Most come on a coach and leave after only a few hours, says Kattan. “They may have a cheap, quick meal. Or they’re taken to a shop that is a Disneyland of everything that has a relation to God,” he adds, referring to the religious souvenir shops. They miss out on much of the town – its market, museums and many restaurants – and rarely go anywhere else in Palestine.“If those people walk around the town and see how we live, it’s a fantastic way to get our real story out,” he says. “Our story to me is anything beyond the perceptions there have been about Palestinians, whether they are the misery side, ‘Oh, the poor Palestinians’, or the fantasy of ‘Oh, Palestine is dangerous’,” says Kattan.Palestinians are especially hospitable because they want outsiders to see their country, he says: “We have a beautiful country and people don’t realise it.” Kattan, who opened a hotel in the town four years ago, is on a mission to change this. Over the next four days he recommends a tour of Palestine’s cultural sites, markets and erse landscape.I’m staying at his hotel, Hosh Al-Syrian (doubles from £63 B\u0026ampB), in a renovated building in the old city, which dates back 1,000 years. Its 12 rooms have arched walls and deep-red carpets. Its adjoining restaurant, Fawda, sources all ingredients from local producers and offers a fusion of French and Palestinian cuisine. It is not designed for pilgrims looking for a bargain room but for people with an interest in Palestinian food, geopolitics and culture.Hosh Al-Syrian is a contrast to Banksy’s much-publicised Walled Off hotel, which opened nearby in 2017. On my first afternoon in Palestine, I visit its museum. Interiors are an uncomfortable mix of lavish British colonial decor and reminders of the occupation. Afternoon tea is served on the patio, in a gilded china teapot, while the grey concrete wall that ides Israel from the Palestinian territories looms opposite. It’s a jarring experience.Some argue that aspects of the hotel trivialise the occupation. There are, says Kattan, plenty of hotels and restaurants that offer a more authentic experience. Local businesses – which have far less financial clout – face the greatest challenges when operating in a volatile political context. Another day, we eat at Abu Eli’s restaurant,  where I’m told the family’s kebabs are so good that his father was once escorted by security to cook for Yasser Arafat (I’m vegetarian, but enjoy a delicious range of salads). Kattan also recommends having a drink in the Rewined bar, but unfortunately, it’s closed when I’m in town.I visit the Bethlehem Historical Museum, established by the town’s Arab Women’s Union, which Kattan’s late grandmother, Julia, helped to found. The association, created in 1947 (during the Arab-Israeli war to provide employment for women and deliver aid to refugees) became a cultural beacon in the city, Kattan tells me. “They opened the first mixed-sex pool in Palestine, the first public library in Palestine,” he says. Many of its projects closed but the museum and food production projects survived. Lots of its exhibits have been donated by local families and show how life in the town has changed: from the designs of homes to traditional clothing.To get from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, tourists must show a passport and visa at a checkpoint, but they don’t face the same travel restrictions as Palestinians living in the West Bank. They have to apply for a permit to enter East Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.Heading for Jerusalem, I walk through checkpoint 300 before taking a taxi. In the late morning, there’s only a short queue of families waiting to get through the turnstiles. In the early hours it’s a different story: thousands of Palestinians start queuing as early as 3am to get through in time to start their jobs in Jerusalem.Back in the West Bank, we travel to Sebastia in the north of the territory to view the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. It is believed that the remains of John the Baptist (except for his head, which was apparently taken to Damascus) are buried here in a tomb in the cental courtyard of a mosque whose outside used to be a Crusader church. The site shows the layering of history that has shaped Palestine, says Kattan.From the rooftop of Hosh Al-Syrian there’s a view across all Bethlehem’s churches and mosques. In the early morning, the sound of church bells mingles with the call to prayer. There are several myths about the territory, Kattan adds, including the belief that it is home to just one religion. “It’s varied. Even within each of the inidual religions you have so many small communities where the traditions are different,” he says. “It’s one of the places where you learn more about brotherhood between religions … historically all faiths have lived together here.”On the walls of the dining area hang colourful patterned plates made by the famous Jerusalem Pottery, a business run by an Armenian family, part of the erse range of communities in East Jerusalem.• The trip was provided by Hosh Al-Syrian, Amos Trust (a small, creative human rights organisation) and Zaytoun, a social enterprise and community interest companyLooking for a holiday with a difference?

We look at how travel changed in the 2010sFirst the Scandinavians gave us hygge, then they gave us flygskam (flight shame), which has nothing to do with candles and everything to do with guilt about the environmental cost of flying.If the noughties were all about a giddy sense of the world opening up thanks to the rise of low-cost flights and online booking tools, the subsequent decade has started to feel like payback time, as we begin to reckon with the cost of our globetrotting ways. A 2019 YouGov report showed levels of concern about the environment at a record high. As the climate change crisis becomes more acute and the cost of overtourism bleakly apparent from Venice to Machu Picchu, there’s a growing sense that we need to rethink not just where we travel but how we travel, too.After years of cuts to European sleeper services, there are signs that the tide may be beginning to turn here, too. Next month, a new Nightjet service will launch between Vienna and Brussels, while Swiss Federal Railways is also looking into reintroducing its Wagon-Lits overnight services after they were cancelled in 2009. Sleeper trains from Amsterdam to other European capitals could also be in the offing.Could this be the start of a new golden era of rail travel? It’s too soon to say, but there are signs that our love affair with low-cost flying is cooling. And when you smugly book a rail trip and feel a sudden urge to tell your friends, remember the Swedes have a word for that too – tagskryt (train bragging).It’s estimated that, on any given night, 2 million people are staying in an Airbnb rental. But 10 years ago Airbnb was just another San Francisco start-up looking for investors. The three founders had come up with the idea to make some extra cash by renting out an airbed on their living room floor.The idea quickly inflated to become a global travel empire that today has more than 7 million listings in 191 countries. The company’s slogan, “Belong Anywhere”, tapped into a desire for a more authentic and intimate experience than traditional hotels could offer. You could hang out with your host, get insider tips on bars and restaurants, and shop at the neighbourhood deli like a local.In 2016, Airbnb further capitalised on this wish to go beyond the tourist traps by launching its own range of “Experiences” with local guides, offering everything from bar crawls in Barcelona to pasta-making lessons with Italian grandmas.The success of Airbnb has inspired dozens of imitators, with peer-to-peer equivalents for every travel need, whether it be camping (campspace), yacht sharing (borrowaboat) or currency exchange (weswap).Inevitably, with such rapid growth came some snags: stories of dodgy hosts, dodgy guests, inferior accommodation, last-minute cancellations and fake reviews. There has also been growing unease about the impact Airbnb has had on rents in cities such as Barcelona, with landlords able to make more money from short-term guests than long-term rentals.But despite critics’ complaints that Airbnb is changing the nature of the very neighbourhoods it aims to celebrate, there are no signs that the bubble is about to burst. The company, now valued at more than $35bn, recently acquired a hotel booking system and app and a luxury holiday rental company, and has announced that it’s about to start selling adventure holidays, too. It’s a long way from a blow-up mattress.One of the most popular “experiences” Airbnb sells is the “Instagram photo walk”, where a local influencer or photographer will snap tourists in front of various landmarks and offer tips on how to capture the perfect social media shots. That such tours exist is testament to the power of the photo-sharing platform, which launched in 2010, ushering in a decade of bad selfies and Insta-sunsets.While it’s true that a picture can be worth a thousand words, it can also inspire tens of thousands of Instagrammers to try to capture the exact same image. Tales abound of bloggers queuing along the narrow cobbled streets of Santorini to replicate an iconic shot of Oia’s blue-domed church, and brawling at Rome’s Trevi fountain as tourists jostle for the perfect selfie.As well as influencing our choice of destination, the rise of image-sharing platforms has started to have an impact on the way those destinations look. Hotel designers are now briefed to include Insta-friendly features, whether it be an eye-catching mural or a hot tub with a view. Cavo Tagoo, a luxury boutique hotel on Mykonos, Greece, is an example of what happens when that’s done well. Its infinity pool with colour-changing lights, aquarium bar, minimalist white decor and sunset views is irresistibly photogenic and has helped it to become the most followed hotel on Instagram this year.According to Google Trends, the word glamping first appeared as a search term in 2007, but the trend for posh camping really took off in the past decade. By 2016 it had earned an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary.The first glampsites comprised a smattering of tipis or yurts in a field – essentially, camping holidays for people who didn’t want to put up their own tents – but intensifying competition has upped the ante. In recent years anything from retired ambulances to old shipping containers have been pressed into service, and the quest for novelty reached new heights, literally, in 2017, when glamping specialist Canopy and Stars suspended a cabin from a cargo crane above Bristol harbour.Earlier this year, the legendary Ibiza party hotel Pikes – whose swimming pool was the backdrop for Wham’s Club Tropicana video back in 1983 – announced that it would be running its first spring fitness retreat, the three-night Rockovery, in May. It was a seminal moment – proof that “wellness” had indeed become the new rock’n’roll.The island’s decision to reinvent itself as a holistic holiday destination was a shrewd one. Wellness tourism is big business, and growing faster than any other sector of the travel industry. Once the preserve of dedicated health resorts and retreats, it has gone mainstream, from fitness bootcamps in the Algarve to mindful skiing in the Alps.Perhaps one of the biggest shifts has been “wellness” moving out of the hotel basement and into the great outdoors. Where once a spa break meant shuffling in white towelling slippers between hot tub, sauna and massage table, now it’s all about reconnecting with nature and enjoying mindful exercise. Forest bathing, stargazing and wood-fired hot tubs are replacing gyms and infinity pools as selling points.The Finn Lough resort near Enniskillen in County Fermanagh is a good example of the new breed of low-key holistic retreats: here guests follow a trail through the grounds, stopping off at a lakeside hot tub, an aromatherapy sauna or a woodland shower.The desire to escape our sedentary, switched-on lives is also driving the growth of fitness and wellbeing festivals, such as the Big Retreat in Pembrokeshire, which, as well as yoga, Pilates and circuit training, offers cookery classes, tai chi and wild swimming.Experiences are the new luxury. Rather than splashing their cash on designer goods, people with disposable income are choosing to spend it on “transformational experiences”.Whether it’s learning to cook with immigrants from Asia, Europe and South America in their New York City homes or joining a reforestation programme in the Amazon, travellers are looking for more meaningful interactions with locals and for immersive experiences that go beyond ticking off the usual sightseeing spots.Tour operators are catching on to the trend. Scott Dunn recently launched its own “experiential” portfolio, offering a range of personalised activities, from perfume-making workshops in Paris to taiko drumming lessons in Tokyo.Hoteliers are also starting to respond to these consumer shifts. It’s no longer enough to offer a comfortable bed, a decent breakfast and an eye-catching design the new breed of “lifestyle” hotels are courting their guests with the promise of immersion into a neighbourhood, a chance to mingle with locals and a menu of enriching activities.The Whitworth Locke, which opened last year in a former cotton mill near Manchester’s Canal Street, is a perfect example of this new hybrid of accommodation and culture hub. Before guests have even picked up their room key, they’re plunged into a world of exciting possibilities. Free yoga class? Painting workshop? Browsing the homewares and houseplants for sale in the lobby? Dining on Mexican street food in the pop-up restaurant?With a new emphasis on informality and authenticity, it appears that traditional tourism providers, be they hotel chains or tour operators, are finally starting to learn from the successes of their peer-to-peer rivals and, in doing so, creating a new template for tourism.If they’re going to survive the next decade, it’s a lesson they’ll need to score full marks in.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Anyone for a game of Boar on the Floor?Spare a thought for HBO: 2019 was the year it threw millions upon millions of dollars at the final season of Game of Thrones, only to have another of its shows – with a fraction of the budget – blow Jon Snow and co out of the water entirely. That show was the dizzyingly seductive Succession, which became a runaway hit with its second series. A veritable powerhouse, Succession contained all the things that had once drawn us to Westeros: power, wealth, loyalty and sheer nastiness. However – and this is crucial – it was also shot through with such a clear sense of purpose that you could never imagine it going off the rails. The funny moments were far too hysterical. The dramatic moments were weightier than they had any right to be. Game of Thrones spent an entire episode letting a dragon destroy a city. Meanwhile, Succession gave us a single scene of an old man shouting at a car, and it was infinitely more devastating.The first season – which focused on a powerful media tycoon’s health wobble, and his squabbling brood vying for the chance to take over his empire – marked Jesse Armstrong’s series out as a solid, impressive programme. But with its second run, it became something much bigger, a breathtakingly sleek meditation on cruelty, corruption and how not to dispose of your super-duper top-secret business documents. The characters boasted new depth, from the increased sadism of Brian Cox’s Logan (see the Boar on the Floor game he invents to humiliate his family) to Kendall’s never-ending reserves of cringe (as evidenced by the the berserk rap he writes for his father – sample line, “Yo, bitches be catty, but the king’s my daddy”).The plot, too, piled up on itself with a relentless aggression. The self-serving spitefulness of the Roy family was repeatedly put into sharp relief by a number of foils and opponents who were somehow even worse. There was Cherry Jones’s Nan Pierce with her fragile morality, Holly Hunter’s Rhea Jarrell, blindsided by her own dumb ambition, and Eric Bogosian’s Gil Eavis, in equal parts bewitched and repulsed by the family’s naked power. The whole thing is a nest of vipers. The Roy family are as craven as any you will ever see on screen, but you’ll be damned if you don’t find yourself rooting for them, too.Because, indeed, the Roys are both the heroes and the antagonists of the show. Earlier this year, would-be US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg failed to grasp this dynamic, telling the Hollywood Reporter that he hadn’t caught the Succession bug: “I need a character to root for and I haven’t decided if any of them are good people.” This grey area, though, is precisely what keeps Succession ticking over, and what has led to a glut of Roy-flavoured content online, from a Buzzfeed quiz that tells you what character you’re most like’ to a version of its theme tune lovingly recreated in a Nintendo game.It is also a genuine joy to watch, full of intrigue and masterful twists. True confirmation of that came with the season two finale, which took place on an absurd screw-you yacht. There was unparalleled backstabbing, queasy power dynamics and unexpected chicken-eating. The final scene stomped on the accelerator right when it should have been easing off, before that ambiguous smile at the end, and the universe of possibilities contained within it. It was the sort of episode that had you holding your breath, until it made you involuntarily roar with laughter.Succession is a happy reminder that – in an age where studios are chucking money and A-listers at endless spinoffs and prequels – nothing will ever beat a show that has its fundamentals down like this. The script is gleaming. The production values are top notch. The acting – from Kieran Culkin’s snarling, vulnerable Roman to Sarah Snook’s increasingly mercenary Shiv – is among the best in town. As a happy bonus, Nicholas Britell’s theme tune sounds like the contents of heaven itself falling down a metal staircase.Pete Buttigieg might not get it, but gladly he’s in the minority. Succession isn’t about whether or not the Roys are good people. In this brash, satirical horror show, those hazy lines between good and bad, winners and losers, sympathy and utter disgust are precisely what kept us gripped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5fd6fa31ba33dde57ce9fb3913f62125fc22c4/0_467_6088_3653/master/6088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52e969a47ef2f1800dcd6b13b2c8b95","title":"emily maitlis prince andrew was unleashed he wanted to tell me everything","story":"Newsnight was granted a rare audience with the royal ... and after a decade of silence, he was unstoppable. Its presenter shares the secrets of the interview of the centurySeries 3, episode 4: The Crown. A BBC van pulls up at Buckingham Palace to record a royal documentary.As in life, so with television: timing is everything. Had The Crown aired its new series one week earlier … Had the fictional Queen been spotted squirming at the TV crews in her midst … Had the distant memories of a now-banned palace interview been fresher in our minds … It is entirely possible, and more than probable, that the Prince Andrew interview would never have happened.This is the discussion in the Newsnight office a couple of weeks after it aired. We still cannot quite believe it happened. We have to pinch ourselves seeing global headlines, day after day: the ramifications of all the painstaking observations he made to us in that hour of surreal television. I agreed to do an interview about the interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. “Was this your ‘FrostNixon’ moment?” they asked as I walked in. I had barely taken off my coat.I gulped. It felt like the finest thing I have ever been asked, but I couldn’t find a way to respond without sounding like a muppet. They watched every frame. They could tell me the time of the clock hands in the opening shot. “What about his tie?” they asked. “Why was a member of the family of Windsor unable to tie a correct Windsor knot?” I was stumped. I realised they had pored over the interview more intensely than me, one finger permanently on pause and rewind.People have asked what I was thinking as I sat there opposite the prince, preparing for the questions to come. How do you make small talk? How do you compose the tone you need for the hour ahead?My overriding emotion was relief. I expected the interview to be pulled at every stage. It had been months in the making and got sign-off just 48 hours earlier. Even then it was pushed back by a couple of hours, then brought forward by one.My fear was that any sign of procrastination, any shifting of the timetable, would ultimately end in cancellation. So I mainly felt joy we had got this far. The weight of expectation was second to that. No one knew the interview was coming. There had been no publicity. Indeed, the whole event had been kept intensely private.The prince put me at ease chatty, relaxed. He showed us the end of the room where they kept a projector – it was turned into a cinema every Thursday evening for the palace staff. As we adjusted our seated positions for the photos, he asked if I had ever been interviewed by David Frost. It was not calculated to shock me, but it did. In his eyes, Frost is the convivial Sunday morning telly host, thrower of excellent parties. But in my head, Frost is the arsonist-in-chief of FrostNixon fame. I wonder if he caught my look of alarm at the mention of the name.I am always impressed by interviewers who can do the whole thing without notes. I can’t. I need reminders on my knee. Dates, first names, quotes in bold text. I am addicted to the highlighter pen, my papers generally a garish mix of type, Biro, unreadable scribble and lashings of luminosity, as if they belong to the unhinged. It has to be something that catches my eye in a moment of amnesia or panic. Over the years, I have practised how to lift an entire sentence with a brief glance down, while trying to hold the gaze of whomever I’m talking to. It is the little things that throw me – the wrong pen, the wrong font. An interview done standing up is a disaster. I need my knees to rest notes on.It is these weird superstitions that can make or break your confidence in those moments before the cameras start rolling. The interview itself, perhaps bizarrely, is the easiest bit. He is there. I am there. The prep is done.We had role-played the interview to prepare. We had imagined scenarios and responses, evasions and deviations. “Do I have to say ‘Sir’ after each question?” I pondered. My editor, Esme Wren, gave me a gentle look, as if I had gone slightly mad. “You are courteous and firm. This is a Newsnight interview, not a royal encounter.” It was her focused, steely, enquiring look I found myself channelling each time nerves deserted me.We began to record. I thought about how reasonable he sounded. He was explaining why Jeffrey Epstein was never really his friend, more “a friend of a friend”. For one moment, I imagined I had got everything wrong, misunderstood the story entirely. But I stuck to the line of questioning. And it paid off.Does he regret the visit to stay with Epstein? “Yes.” Does he regret the whole friendship?It was around 16 minutes into the interview – and it was the answer that, for me, changed everything.“Still not,” he said. And told me of the opportunities he was given by Epstein that were “actually very useful …”. It was such a candid admission, such a bald refusal to play the game with any wider apology or regret. It would become the pivotal moment of the entire hour. This is a man – a prince – who did not come to repent. He came to earn back his right to tell the story his way.Once I understood that, everything else flowed from there. Andrew was unleashed. Unstoppable. After a decade of silent frustration, he wanted to tell me everything. He paused being “a royal” and found his voice.He told me things he had no need to reveal. About his sweat problems and his trip to Woking, about his knowledge of Belgravia homes and London nightspots.I do not need to tell you the rest. The interview. The memes. The Pizza Express reviews. My single (and inadvertent) contribution to youth culture.And, after the allotted 45 minutes, we stopped. The prince was still charming, and even more relaxed. He took me off down the marble hall. We chatted about the famous King’s speech and he pointed out the ministers’ staircase, which the prime minister ascends each week to meet the Queen.We ended on good terms. He had been generous with his time. We may even – now I think about it – have pulled away first. And then we bundled into a black cab back to the office. The interview was ours. Tiny computer memory cards wrapped snug in a folded old envelope. A curious clash of the digital and the deeply analogue. Our producer, Jake, clutched them to his chest. We were sworn to silence for another 12 hours, the recording itself under literal lock and key. Until the rollout began the next morning.It has taken three weeks for my shoulders to finally drop. Three weeks to absorb that the interview we did that day may yet have the power to change the lives of Epstein’s victims. Three weeks of headlines and blanket coverage. Three weeks to realise that questions about the clock and the tie knot and the meaning of a glance or a gesture will continue and ultimately overtake us.What began with a plan, a hunch and a Newsnight huddle now has a life of its own. It is no longer ours. It belongs somewhere bigger.Emily Maitlis is the lead presenter for BBC Newsnight and the author of Airhead – the Imperfect Art of Making News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes.

Some train drivers suggested they could continue striking over the holidays, potentially leaving people scrambling to reach their families.The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, held talks with unions and employers’ representatives on Thursday as the government sought to avoid a Christmas holiday pile-up of frustrated travellers on Friday and over the weekend.The president, Emmanuel Macron, this week indicated via his office that he was “willing to improve” his plan to eliminate dozens of separate pension schemes by creating a single points-based system. This left a window open for possible government concessions as negotiations continued into Thursday night.Unions are angry in particular at a new “pivot age” of 64 that workers would have to reach in order to receive a full pension, beyond the official retirement age of 62.The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key election promise. It is part of his pledge to deliver the biggest “transformation” of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era.Street marches took place in Paris and other cities. Recent polls show a majority of people still support the strikes and protests, as they fear they will have to work longer in return for lower pensions. Past polls have shown broad support for Macron’s principle of streamlining the pension system but, amid confusion over the changes, many do not trust the government to carry out the reforms in a fair way.Even if the strikes ease slightly, maintenance and timetabling issues could lead to a knock-on effect on Christmas services. The ecology minister, Élisabeth Borne, who handles transport, said this week that 850,000 train tickets had been purchased for Christmas travel and that all would have a place on a train.The SNCF said it could not announce travel availability between the 24 and 26 December until Friday. There were long queues at ticket offices in Paris as passengers sought to exchange tickets and take whatever services were available over the weekend, but some smaller destinations, for example towns in the south-west of France, were likely to see key services cancelled and very limited local trains or buses.The SNCF also said the strikes had led it to cancel France’s popular unaccompanied minor service on holiday trains, in which children aged between 4 and 14 can travel with a monitor. About 6,000 children will not be able to travel with the service over Christmas. Philippe Martinez, head of the leftwing CGT union, accused the rail firm of “political spin” by choosing to suspend children’s services.Macron suffered a fresh blow on Thursday as the Paris prosecutor’s office announced a preliminary investigation into possible conflicts of interest by the official leading the pensions reform process.Jean-Paul Delevoye resigned his post earlier this week after admitting he had failed to publicly declare all of his affiliations when taking on the pension project."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92a31d846151fc0c8d08147b5e719afb7ff16a6d/0_73_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50e5226a68f39de60e1fcffc3b666d2d","title":"joshua boyle caitlan coleman trial verdict","story":"Justice to rule on 19 charges against Joshua Boyle and weigh credibility of competing testimony from him and Caitlan ColemanA Canadian judge is set to determine the fate of Joshua Boyle, the former hostage who spent five years in Afghanistan with his family and stands accused of sexually assaulting his estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman.The Ontario superior court justice Peter Doody will rule on Thursday on the 19 charges against Boyle, including assault with a weapon and forcible confinement. In doing so, Doody will also weigh the credibility of competing testimony from Coleman and Boyle, who have provided starkly different accounts of their time in Ottawa, where the alleged crimes are said to have occurred.In 2012, then newlyweds Boyle and Coleman travelled to Afghanistan, where they were kidnapped by a Taliban-linked group shortly after arriving in the restive country.They spent five years in captivity, during which time Coleman gave birth to three children, and were eventually freed by Pakistani soldiers in 2017. Soon after, they returned to Canada, where crown prosecutors allege Boyle abused Coleman.Coleman traveled from her home in Pennsylvania to Ottawa for the judge-only trial. She testified from a separate room in the court to avoid sharing a room with her estranged husband.In addition to instances of sexual assault, Coleman described a list of demands created by Boyle, dictating her behaviour, diet, exercise and frequency of sex. She claims she was punished physically if she failed meet the expectations laid out in the list.“In the past, he made it clear he didn’t feel any guilt hurting me,” she told the court.Coleman also recounted a harrowing late-night escape, fearing for her life as she ran from the couple’s apartment into a “dangerously cold” Ottawa winter, wearing only socks on her feet.“It took me a while to get up my courage to do it. But I did,” she told the court. Coleman told the court how she took shelter at a nearby pizza shop, and phoned her mother, who was in town visiting, for help. Boyle was arrested later that night.Boyle’s defence team pushed back at the crown’s portrayal of their client.“Mr Boyle is not easy to like. He is not conventional … by society’s so-called ‘norms’,” said the defence lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon. “But he is a person who tells the truth, even if it’s not to his own advantage.”Boyle has admitted to criticizing his wife, fighting often and striking her once while the two were in captivity, but rejected accusations this behaviour carried over to their life in Ottawa.Boyle told the court that the couple had a turbulent relationship, that they participated in BDSM and that Coleman’s “tempestuous personality” affected her ability to accurately recall events, with his legal team suggesting Coleman’s testimony was “neither credible nor reliable”.He also claimed that he had only restrained Coleman was for her own safety, fearing she might be suicidal.The trial was initially expected to only last weeks, but was delayed by a handful of procedural questions – including debate over how much of Coleman’s sexual history would be admissible as evidence. Coleman also created confusion in the trial after speaking to media outlets, despite the judge’s request not to speak publicly about the case.Doody is expected to release his decision in the criminal case against Boyle on Thursday morning in Ottawa."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4120849.1576777391!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lean times for turkey producers due to low prices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRobert Fitzsimons on his Cork farm with   his son Robert jnr.

He has serious doubts there will be a fourth generation Fitzsimons involved in his business despite the fact that he has an 11-year-old son who dreams of taking over his father’s farm one day.“All my son wants to be is a poultry farmer like me but I don’t believe any of my children will be involved in the business,” he says. “I look at my son and can’t see how he will be able to make a living doing what I do. And that’s very sad to say.”He says the blame for difficulties in the industry lies with retailers who have been driving down the price of turkey for years.Consumers also share some responsibility, he says, as they increasingly believe all food – no matter how much it costs to produce – should always be available at rock bottom prices.“I don’t think the public realise how food is produced any more and how much it costs to produce it. They also think that everything they see that is labelled ‘turkey’ is the same and that is a major problem,” he says.“There is a major problem with turkey breast meat being imported into this country and then taken out of vacuum bags and without the consumer having any idea where is has originated and how old it is.”Day-old chicksFor Fitzsimons, turkey season started over the August bank holiday weekend when all his day-old chicks arrived from the UK. They cost him about €8 each. To that price he has had to add the cost of feed, labour and housing the birds for around five months before they are sold.Some cut-price supermarkets have started selling turkeys for as little as €9. But turkeys available at that price are small and frozen and they have almost certainly not been produced by Irish farmers.Fitzsimons says these low prices create the impression in consumers’ minds that turkey is cheap to produce.“But it really is not,” he stresses. “A quality turkey costs between €26 and €40 to produce, so even when a supermarkets is selling it for €25 and €30, they can only be breaking even. We cannot compete with those prices and are going to go out of business even though we are producing a great product that people want to eat.“We might have a turkey that cost €40 to produce and so we need to sell it for €50 to make a margin but people see the low prices elsewhere and wonder what we are at. There are farmers who are going to die paupers even though they are producing great food.”Fitzsimons is not the only one expressing concern as Christmas comes closer.“We are not selling nearly as many turkeys as we used to and that’s because we have to compete with the prices in supermarkets that are just too low,” says Paddy Buckley of FX Buckley on Dublin’s Moore Street.‘Absolute disgrace’He pays turkey producers about €5 per kilo for his product, which means a 6.5kg bird costs him about €33. “I can’t sell that for €25 to match the supermarket prices. It is an absolute disgrace the price they are selling the turkeys for. A huge amount of work goes into producing a turkey and it is absolutely ridiculous to see them for sale for as low as €8.99.”Despite their price, the very cheapest turkeys do not represent good value for money. The bone structure of a 6.5kg turkey and a 3.2kg turkey is roughly the same, so all the extra weight on the bigger bird is meat.Buckley says turkey crowns are increasingly popular and he expects a “mad rush” between December 21st and Christmas Eve.He says that in spite of the temptation of the cheaper fowl on supermarket shelves, many people are still willing to pay extra for a good fresh turkey.“The trick is not to eat too much of it in the run-up to Christmas. If you buy a decent fresh turkey that has been looked after well, and wait until Christmas Day to have it, then you are going to absolutely love it,” he says.Washing turkeysBut while the turkey remains popular, it is not entirely problem-free.Earlier this month, Safefood published details of a survey which showed that in spite of warnings published each year, as many as 40 per cent of Irish people persist in washing their turkeys before cooking them, which can contribute to the spread of harmful bacteria.Irish Water has pleaded with people not to pour turkey grease down the sink, warning that it can create all sorts of problems, not least the build-up of “fatbergs” which can cause huge blockages across the infrastructure in the days and weeks after Christmas Day."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4120864.1576778765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"stunningly little being done to combat climate change un official says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf  Alston said Australia had awarded contracts worth billions to extract coal but parts of the country were ‘burning furiously’ due to bushfires. File photograph: David GrayBloombergThe prospect of limiting a rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees – a key target of the Paris climate change agreement – “is now almost comprehensively lost unless there is a revolution across the world”, a UN official has said.Prof Philip Alston, special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said governments, including Ireland’s, were declaring climate emergencies but the problem was “nobody is listening” to what the science was indicating and responding accordingly.“We will be extremely lucky if we get close to a rise of 2 degrees and the prospects are rising every day that we will be up 3 to 4 degrees,” he told a seminar in Dublin on Thursday.Prof Alston said despite the extent of the crisis, “we are doing dramatically and stunningly little” to cut carbon emissions “and that includes Ireland, I’m sorry to say”.Greenhouse gas emissions had doubled since 1990, while current government plans for fossil fuel expansion would see a 50 per cent increase globally in production between now and 2030.He said Australia, where he is from, had awarded contracts worth billions to extract coal, but parts of the country are “burning furiously” due to bushfires breaking out and spreading amid high temperatures.Polish delegatesHe said Poland, headed by a climate-sceptic government, refused last week to sign up to Europe’s green new deal. This coincided with him being at a human rights congress, where Polish delegates were casually wondering why the snow was a month late.“There was no real preparedness to put two and two together.”He said it may surprise some but Brussels was the only place where progressive steps were being taken.On human rights, he warned of the risk of climate apartheid, where the wealthy could avoid the worst excesses of climate disruption as “they can simply move, and move country if needed”.Prof Alston said human rights violations always affected the poor most, and in the case of climate change he predicted it would be by a factor of four, with the global south being most vulnerable.While Irish people might remark “we are not going to burn”, people in the global south face wipe-out in one go and have no insurance or government subsidies.This would lead to climate migration and he believed it would eventually lead to hundreds of millions being forced to move. He also predicted that food supplies would be dramatically challenged across the planet.Right to liveProf Alston told an event, hosted by the human rights committee of the Bar of Ireland and the Irish Centre for Human Rights (ICHR) with the Ryan Institute in NUI Galway, that the human rights community was not very responsive though it was very exercised on the right to live and capital punishment, and yet millions were being “executed by climate change”.The worsening climate crisis was also a threat to democracy, which was shown to be “pathetically incapable of responding to climate change” as politicians remain locked into short-term election cycles, he said.ICHR director Prof Siobhán Mullally said climate change threatens human rights and that “activists, lawyers, governments and policymakers need to mobilise and to take courageous and bold steps now to safeguard the future of our children and the fragile protections of human rights that we have fought to defend”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4120893.1576780446!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents googling children s symptoms leading to slammed gp services","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Dr Mel Bates said another problem was the “collapse” of the same day service for patients in general practice. “People are choosing not to wait until they get an appointment with their own GP and they’re coming to out-of-hours.”  Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Out-of-hours doctor services are coming under pressure because parents are Googling symptoms of children’s illnesses and then treating routine colds or coughs as “potential catastrophes”, the director of a Dublin GP co-op has said. Dr Mel Bates, medical director of the Northdoc service in north Dublin, said out-of-hours services across the State had been “slammed” in recent weeks. He said parents were presenting to the out-of-hours services “horrified” that their child had a cold or cough “for a few hours in some cases”. Speaking at a HSE briefing on the winter flu season on Thursday, Dr Bates said part of the problem was parents were looking up their children’s symptoms online and fearing the worst. “The trouble with it is it tends to promote normal childhood illnesses best treated with time and paracetamol as potential catastrophes,” Dr Bates said. “People need to understand that normal childhood illnesses last about eight days...We get lots of people horrified that their child has a cold for a few days or a cough for a few hours in some cases. The parents would come in with the same levels of anxiety as others with children who had far more serious illnesses.” Dr Bates said another problem was the “collapse” of the same day service for patients in general practice. “People are choosing not to wait until they get an appointment with their own GP and they’re coming to out-of-hours.” Worse than last yearHSE officials told the briefing that the winter flu season was shaping up to be worse than last year, with the current strain of influenza particularly harmful to older people. Eight people have died due to flu-related illnesses so far this season, seven of whom were aged 65 years or older. A total of 627 people have been admitted to hospital with the flu, with more than 300 admitted in the last week alone, the HSE said. Dr Kevin Kelleher, HSE assistant national director for public health, said the flu season had arrived four to five weeks early this year and was now heading into its “peak” before likely dropping off in early January. “It’s a fairly big flu season at the moment, how long it will last remains to be seen,” he said. Ms O’Connor said while there were higher attendances there were less cases where people had to be admitted to hospitals, which showed “something is working”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Henry McMahon died of brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen, inquest toldFour of the North\u0026rsquos five main parties aside from the DUP prepared to sign up to new agreement to reinstate StormontEight people have died due to flu-related illnesses so far this season more than 300 admitted to hospital in last week aloneBaby girl found unconscious in Cork apartment on July 5thJudge acknowledges certain psychological problems but jails offender for 2\u0026frac12 yearsProf Philip Alston says \u0026lsquonobody is listening\u0026rsquo to science and responding accordinglyOffaly schoolchild whose bike was hit by a van recovered well but still gets headachesDarren Lee Proudfoot claims reference in Irish Daily Mirror report completely falseCormac \u0026Oacute Braon\u0026aacutein \u0026lsquopatchwork quilt of a person with a thousand passions\u0026rsquo, says sisterRugby body met Department of Sport officials about football organisation\u0026rsquos financial issuesEmployee claims back injury sustained due to angle at which tray delivered to passengerJudges rule trial was fair despite 44-year delay in prosecution, and absence of witnessDublin southside train commuters faced disruption due to incident at BooterstownReview of 41 homicide inquiries and found issues with 28 of themFormer Defence Forces soldier is accused of membership of terrorist organisationSister-in-law of criminal was on her way with his widow to UK to meet undertaker when phones seizedNI\u0026rsquos politicians must grapple with health but Stormont has been sidelined for nearly three yearsCabinet called for inquiry after members of Sinn F\u0026eacutein invited by Labour MPs were \u0026lsquoleft unattended for some time\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4119024.1576659880!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"border residents feel overwhelming uncertainty due to brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA lorry passes an anti-Brexit billboard seen on the Dublin-Newry road last October. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesMany people living along the Border have an “overwhelming feeling of uncertainty” as a result of Brexit, according to a new report by researchers at Queen’s University, Belfast (QUB) and the Irish Central Border Area Network (ICBAN). Those surveyed also described how Brexit had already had an economic and social impact on their lives and future plans, and had put off making financial or business decisions, or had experienced major changes such as the loss of a job or problems in labour recruitment because of Brexit. Many felt a “related sense of insecurity” which was “exacerbated by ongoing speculation about what the future for the Border might be.” The Border Into Brexit: Perspectives from Local Communities in the Central Border Region of IrelandNorthern Ireland is the third in a series of reports by QUB, in association with ICBAN, which study the views of Border residents on Brexit. More than 500 people from Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo in the Republic of Ireland, as well as those in the council areas of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Fermanagh and Omagh and Mid Ulster in Northern Ireland, contributed to the research. The report also described a “feeling of lack of political representation and voicelessness which exacerbates the sense of anxiety.” “I feel very angry that there is no one to represent my voice in the UK Parliament - and also in our local Assembly,” said one respondent. “This is the area and the people that are likely to be most affected and where are the leaders representing us?” The first phase of the research was carried out before the Brexit deadline on October 31st, when the risk of a no deal Brexit appeared highest, while the second phase was conducted after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had concluded his revised Withdrawal Agreement with the EU and Britain’s withdrawal deadline had been extended until the end of January. In this context, more than four out of five of those surveyed felt the likelihood of a hard Border had increased since 2018. “The overwhelming reason given for this view is political leadership in Westminster, specifically the stance of PM Boris Johnson and the rhetoric of the British government on No Deal. Another reason given is the lack of political leadership from Stormont. “Regardless of views of its likelihood, a harder border is unanimously seen as a retrograde step” and was “associated with conflict in the minds of people of all generations.” For this reason, the report found, the prospect “fear and anxiety for many.” One of the report’s authors, Dr Katy Hayward, said that the “Withdrawal Agreement - objected to by all 18 newly-elected MPs from Northern Ireland - looks set to be ratified, and so Brexit appears likely to see change, to some degree, to borders all around Northern Ireland, as the new UK-EU relationship takes effect.”“In light of this,” she said, “trust-building and cooperation, north-south and British-Irish, will be more important than ever. “The models and examples of such cooperation in the Central Border Region, as presented in this report, are ones that should be valued and built upon.” CSO research Meanwhile, new demographic information on the Border region released by the Central Statistics Office has shed further light on the region. It shows that 128,106 people live within 10 km of the Border on the Republic side, with 14,205 living within 2 km - classed as a half-hour walk.However, the number of people commuting from this zone across the Border to a permanent job in Northern Ireland was relatively small at just 3,638, or 6.1 per cent of the working age population. This does not include mobile workers such as delivery drivers, or farmers who might farm both sides of the Border, or transport goods or animals across the border on a daily basis.The research shows that people in this 10 km zone are likely to be older than the rest of the state, with some 25.2 per cent of the population aged 55 or over, compared to 24 per cent of the rest of the population. The unemployment rate, at 17.5 per cent in 2016, is higher when compared to the rest of the state (12.9 per cent) for the same year.The CSO also identified that there was a higher vacancy rate among the housing stock within 10km of the border. There were 6,857 vacant dwellings, giving a rate of 12.7 per cent, which rose to 15.7 per cent within 2 kilometres of the Border. This compares to a general vacancy rate across the state of 9.4 per cent. However, the housing stock is generally newer than elsewhere in the country, with 26.9 per cent of dwellings built between 2001 and 2010, compared to a wider figure for the state of 25.4 per cent for the same period. Monaghan is the Border county with the highest proportion of its population living less than 10km from a border crossing, at 64 per cent, followed by 33 per cent in Louth and 22 per cent in Donegal. Just 6 per cent of the population of Leitrim lived within the 10km zone, however. The population across the five counties surveyed increased marginally between 2011 and 2016, by just over 1,300 people.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe . The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) has said it has no interest in acquiring the share of the Aviva stadium owned by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).Irish rugby’s governing body confirmed that it does not want to buy the 42.5 per cent stake in the ground held by the FAI after meeting officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on Thursday. The IRFU had requested the meeting to discuss the ongoing operation of the 52,000 seat stadium, which is owned by a company jointly controlled by it and the FAI. “To address recent speculation, the IRFU confirms that it does not have an interest in acquiring the FAI’s share in the Aviva Stadium,” the union said in a statement.“The IRFU’s investment programme is centered firmly on the development of rugby at all levels and all available funds are fully committed to that programme.” The FAI and the IRFU pay a licence fee of roughly €200,000 a month each to help cover the running costs of the stadium, which are partially paid by revenue from concerts and other events. The FAI, however, has fallen behind in its payments by the equivalent of six months, some €1.2 million.TravailsThe IRFU requested the meeting with the department in light of the recent financial travails of its joint venture partner, which revealed it had liabilities of €55 million at the end of last year in accounts earlier this month. TDs were told on Wednesday that the figure has since risen to €62 million due to the forward payment of TV rights and other monies from Uefa, European football’s governing body, in order to keep the FAI afloat. Brendan Menton, the former chief executive of the FAI, has suggested that liabilities could be as high as €85.8 million.In a brief statement released after the meeting, the IRFU said it was agreed at the meeting that it would continue to liaise with the department in relation to the on-going operations of the stadium company. However, the IRFU is thought to be concerned about its responsibilities as a shareholder, and any potential liabilities it may have after the FAI made public the full extent of its financial difficulties. While the subject of selling the FAI stake was repeatedly raised at Wednesday’s meeting of the Oireachtas sport committee, it is believed there would not be any real market for its share given the limited scope of its operations and the fact that it does not generate significant profits.The stadium cost €460 million to build with a government contribution of €191 million. The Government has a first charge over the stadium, meaning it cannot be sold without the permission of the Minister for Sport."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4120919.1576783061!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal to get stormont up and running before christmas could be done but for dup","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith at Stormont in Belfast as he hosted a summit to urge Stormont’s leaders to make a series of commitments to tackle Northern Ireland’s spiralling health service crisis. Photograph: PacemakerPA Wire Northern Secretary Julian Smith and Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that but for DUP opposition there could have been a deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly before Christmas.Mr Smith said on Thursday evening that four of the North’s five main parties aside from the DUP were prepared to sign up to a document outlining a new agreement to reinstate Stormont. He also indicated that the British government was prepared to provide funding to deal with issues such as the health crisis and the nurses and health workers dispute.Mr Smith said he wanted to publish the text of an agreement on Thursday night or on Friday that could have seen the Northern Assembly back in operation by Monday but that the DUP was not prepared to support that text at this stage.The number of outstanding issues was “extremely limited”. Some further negotiation was necessary but the remaining matters could be addressed “in a matter of hours not days”, said Mr Smith.“I am deeply disappointed that we haven’t got all five parties in agreement. There is time tonight (Thursday) to reflect on that decision,” he said.‘We could get this done’The Northern Secretary said some but not all in the DUP were prepared to endorse the deal. “I know that there are people in the DUP who wanted to move forward, and I would urge them to move forward so that we could get this done,” said Mr Smith.Because of the lack of agreement the decision was taken not to publish the text at this stage to try “to give time for people to make the right decision”.Mr Smith and Mr Coveney indicated that efforts to strike a deal would resume after Christmas although they felt that with a change of mind from the DUP it still could be done by Monday.“I don’t think it would take much to get an agreement. I wanted that to be done so that this place could be up and running well before Christmas,” said Mr Smith.Mr Coveney separately endorsed Mr Smith’s comments. “I am on the exact same page as the Secretary of State,” he said.“We are going to continue to work together. The British and Irish governments are really in lockstep here,” he said.“We are at a place now where the two governments within hours could produce texts as a basis for an agreed deal.

shoreditch spells end london business survived blitz","story":"Syd’s coffee stall began serving working Cockneys in 1919,German bombs could not stop drinks pouring at an enduring East End business during the Blitz.But the hipster transformation of Shoreditch and the profusion of “poncey” coffee shops have finally proven too much for a traditional community landmark.Syd’s coffee stall began serving working Cockneys in 1919, funded by a Great War pension, and would survive 10 decades and the best efforts of Nazi bombers.On its 100th anniversary the wooden structure has now been retired and placed in the Museum of London, after the rise of cereal cafes and five-course avocado dinners left little place for a traditional family business.Jane Tothill, 68, took on the stand from her father and grandfather Syd before that, and mourns the loss of a community, along with the coffee stand once at its heart.“You have got these youngsters today going into poncey coffee shops in Shoreditch,” said the third-generation and final proprietor of the stand on Calvert Avenue.Eating out | The ’s latest reviews“It’s becoming more of a struggle to make a living.  She said her old regulars had retired or had moved out of London, with most remaining patrons “people in different professions, builders, decorators, cab drivers”.Ms Tothill, who has run the stand for over 30 years, added on the preponderance of Pret A Manger outlets in the capital in place of local businesses: “I think it’s sad.  There’s one just over the road.  “The area has changed so much.”It was once a working-class quarter in the East End, where Syd Tothill set up a coffee stand 100 year ago with the help of his wartime pension.  It became a popular part of daily life in the area, and remained unshaken by the relentless bombing of the Blitz.  Syd’s own wife May was injured as she rushed from the coffee stand to seek shelter during a raid, after they were given special licence to stay open during blackouts.A converted carriage crafted from mahogany, three generations handed over loose-leaf tea, hot coffee and classic fare from the now centurion structure.  Hillary\u0027s Caterers\u0027, the food side of the business, was named after the conqueror of Everest Sir Edmund Hillary. The British Weather had begun to take its toll on the stall, but Ms Tothill notes 10 years of generational and societal change preceded the end of the business.Syd\u0026#39s served the East End for 100 yearsShe recalls what has gone:  “It’s that community spirit, where everyone knows everyone, and you pass them in the streets and say hello, you are not looking at your phone, you are stopping for a chat.”The stand will be expertly transported to the Museum of London where a piece of the capital’s vanishing history will be preserved.Ms Tothill said her grandfather will be “looking down saying ‘great stuff’.”Vyki Sparkes, of the Museum of London, added: ‘Syd’s is an invaluable piece of our shared history as Londoners, a quiet witness to the challenges and changes in the heart of the East End over the last 100 years.“We look forward to sharing its fascinating story with our visitors in the New Museum.”Investigators put bounty call outside Harrods for Russian oligarch wanted on allegations of $2.5bn fraudComment: If he throws his weight behind the Union, Boris can defeat the

Were you always confident that you had a fighting chance of winning?I think I was quietly confident. I’m not\u0026nbspbeing cocky, but I sort of thought if I could just continue to win, win, win – because that’s what it’s about. I wanted to win the whole\u0026nbspshow. I wanted to show him I’m down to earth, yes, but I can also run a business successfully.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou never once raised your voice throughout the competition. Was it a conscious effort to stay out of the fights?It’s sort of my way. Shouting isn’t my style it isn’t really in me. I do have a loud voice, but I’ve never had to shout at my team – I don’t even shout at my son I just give him a look.\u0026nbspFighting could have thrown off the whole task. That’s why I say I’m a good leader when\u0026nbspothers aren’t so good.What was that final boardroom showdown with Scarlett like?I thought we were respectful of each other as women in business. We’re\u0026nbspboth mothers and were striving for our goal. It was obviously a tough boardroom, and we had a lot to say about why Lord Sugar should invest in us, but ultimately, there was a level of respect.One thing that surprised me at the end was Scarlett getting quite personal. Did that surprise you?I think it was the way Lord Sugar\u0027s question was aimed\u0026nbspbecause I would have reacted the same. He told Scarlett her business\u0026nbspwasn’t as established as mine. Maybe he saw it as “Carina employs X amount of people and is running a turnover of X amount, whereas you’re not,” but Scarlett’s point was that we’ve been running for the same amount of time – so why would her business not be as established as mine? I wasn’t taken aback by it. I expected\u0026nbspit to be tough.Would you say you were this year’s underdog?Yeah, because I wasn’t like Thomas and all “Wahey, come and get your pillows!” We’re quite similar, and he’s ones of my best friends from the show, but whereas I would just think to myself, “Cor, I did a good job there – I made a good rollercoaster,” Tom would come back to me and say, “Carina, I’ve won this task – my rollercoaster is the bollocks.” I’d be quieter in my approach. When I thought I’d done a good job, I wouldn’t shout about it.\u0026nbspThe Apprentice finalists speak out ahead of Lord Sugar\u0027s decisionFired Apprentice candidate Lottie Lion accuses BBC of ‘abandoning’ herThe Apprentice\u0027s Lottie Lion banned from interviews after being firedYour partnership with Thomas in the final task was lovely to watch.It was nice, wasn’t it? I don’t know if people would be conscious of this\u0026nbspbut, because Lord Sugar moved us around, I was never on his team. I think that’s\u0026nbspmaybe why we got on so well – because I didn’t have to manage him. We formed a great friendship in the house. When\u0026nbsphe came back, he was bags of energy and that’s what I needed on that final challenge.If you could employ any of your fellow candidates, who would you choose?Pamela is great, isn’t she? They’re all great. My brand’s about personality – about having some sort of flair and being great with the public,\u0026nbspso Tom would be great. He’d be selling sausage rolls like there’s no tomorrow. We’d sell a lot.Now that you’re officially Lord Sugar’s business partner, I’m assuming you’ve met him away from the cameras. How’s that been?We’ve had a chat, yeah. Lord Sugar is very much how he is, you know? He’s not different off-screen he’d still tell me the same stuff and give me the same advice. I learnt\u0026nbspsome great things from him in that boardroom. He said some quotes that have stuck in my mind. We’re going to have a good adventure.What are you going to do to abate the concerns he initially might have had about your business?I’ll gain his trust massively. I’m gonna prove to him what I wanted to prove from day one: I’m here for business, I’m here to grow dough – literally – and make the business as big as we can. To have him on board\u0026nbspand believing in me is really, really great.What’s the next stage for you and Lord Sugar?I think we’re gonna meet for planning in January. We know we want to open some shops. We’ve already got one in Herne Hill, but hopefully, there’ll be a couple more Dough\u0026nbspBakehouses next year.Impossible question, this, but how would you surmise your\u0026nbspApprentice\u0026nbspexperience?Epic – that’s my word. Or fantastic – any of those words you want to use. it’s been a fantastic opportunity and I’ve loved it from the start. From the audition\u0026nbspstage to the final boardroom, everything’s been amazing.The Apprentice returns to BBC One in 2020The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Endgame\u0026nbsphas grossed $2.79bn at the worldwide box office while\u0026nbspAvatar\u0026nbspmade $2.78bn, according to Box Office Mojo.The third spot is occupied by\u0026nbspTitanic, also a Cameron film.A climb would be made possible for\u0026nbspAvatar\u0026nbspthrough a re-release, which itself would serve as a prelude to the release of the first Avatar\u0026nbspsequel, which is planned for 17 December 2021.Release dates for\u0026nbspAvatar\u0026nbsp3, 4 and 5 have been set for 2023, 2025 and 2027, but Cameron has indicated that some of the sequels’ future will depend on how the earlier chapters perform at the box office.The director previously said that\u0026nbspEndgame\u0026nbspbeating\u0026nbspAvatar‘s box office record gave him “a lot of hope” because it showed that people still frequented cinemas.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fund manager warned it would consider selling its shares if climate change risks were not properly disclosed.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her majority shareholding makes her one of Britain’s richest people and 244th wealthiest in the world, with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to Forbes.In Bet365’s annual report, Ms\u0026nbspCoates highlighted her charity work, including an £85m donation to her foundation, up from £75m the year before.“The size of the donation, and therefore the difference the foundation will be able to make to people’s lives over the coming years, are of great importance to the group,” she said.Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said of Ms Coates’ latest paycheck: “This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues.“It’s important that wealth and how it’s created and shared are properly debated. Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people. There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This will potentially make it more expensive for banks to finance climate-damaging activity.The bank said the tests\u0026nbspwould allow it to quantify climate change risks to\u0026nbspthe financial system for the first time.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.It is now working out how to design the tests, and expects more details to be published in the second half of next year. A first round of test results is pencilled in for 2021.Bank of England governor Mark Carney described the proposed testing regime as a “a pioneering exercise, which builds on the considerable progress in addressing climate-related risks that has already been made by firms, central banks and regulators”.The financial services industry faces increasing scrutiny over its role in climate change, with an increasing number of insurers and fund managers pulling out of investments in fossil fuel firms.Earlier this month, billionaire hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn warned he would begin taking action against companies that do not do enough to tackle the climate emergency.Sir Christopher, founder of TCI Fund Management, which manages more than $28bn (£21bn) of assets, has sent letters to big companies in which it invests, including Google and Airbus.TCI said it would “typically vote against all directors of companies which do not publicly disclose all of their emissions and do not have a credible plan for their reduction”. The fund manager warned it would consider selling its shares if climate change risks were not properly disclosed.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her majority shareholding makes her one of Britain’s richest people and 244th wealthiest in the world, with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to Forbes.In Bet365’s annual report, Ms\u0026nbspCoates highlighted her charity work, including an £85m donation to her foundation, up from £75m the year before.“The size of the donation, and therefore the difference the foundation will be able to make to people’s lives over the coming years, are of great importance to the group,” she said.Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said of Ms Coates’ latest paycheck: “This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues.“It’s important that wealth and how it’s created and shared are properly debated. Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people. There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But even with expectations at their lowest, somehow the overwhelmingly negative response to the film itself has\u0026nbspcome as a surprise.The film’s review embargo, which broke at the strike of midnight, has given way to more journalistic bafflement, oddball analogies and risible cat puns than anyone could have ever predicted.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStarring the likes of Judi Dench, James Corden, Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift, Cats transfers Andrew Lloyd Webber’s equally deranged stage musical to the screen, using “digital fur technology” to morph its stars into oddly sexualised human-cat hybrids.“There are breakdancing felines that, when rendered in CGI, seem to lose the stiffness in their joints and turn into undulating tubes of cat meat,” writes Clarisse Loughrey in her two-star review for The Independent. “There are cats shoved in every corner of each frame, crawling and writhing around,” she adds, “It certainly stays faithful to the original show’s off-putting sexual energy.”Critics elsewhere have been similarly unimpressed, and here’s our round-up of some of their funniest reviews...Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.141 40.

Tom Hooper’s direction to his actors for this semblance of a plot was to act it super horny… But if it wasn’t enough to make the cats horny (why are they so horny?), Hooper also feels the need to make it gross by having them dig through trash and play up their animal instincts. Cats always feels like it’s two seconds away from turning into a furry orgy in a dumpster. That’s the energy you have to sit with for almost two hours.”“You never stop thinking: doesn’t the great Judi Dench look daft, tricked out like that? She, like so many here, basically looks like she’s got a horribly advanced fungal problem… There are moments when this film seems not so much an adaptation of a nonsense classic as a horror story, nearly as obscene as The Human Centipede.”“Cats is a fever dream, a hallucination, an approximation of what would happen if your third eye actually opened and you could suddenly see into the astral plane.”“Once seen, the only realistic way to fix Cats\u0026nbspwould be to spay it, or simply pretend it never happened.

That decision appeared to be a specific attempt to draw attention to the account, and to make clear that the Twitter boss knew about it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMoments later, the Mr Dorsey used his own platform to unfollow\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg. He did not explain the decision, and there was no public interaction between the two.As expected, that triggered an alert from the tracking page that announced that the Twitter boss was no longer following the Facebook founder.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC.

(EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers.

But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared.

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Britain will go to the polls on December 12One anti-poverty charity called on British Gas to reverse the move announced just days before Christmas, saying children, the elderly and vulnerable people could be forced to choose between food and fuel.In addition to the top-up change, pre-pay customers will have 4,000 fewer terminals across the UK to top up at after the gas giant last month announced it was switching from PayPoint to Payzone and post offices.There are 28,000 PayPoint terminals, but the Post Office and Payzone have 24,000 between them.More than one in 10 households living in fuel poverty, figures showSian Williams, director of policy at anti-poverty charity Toynbee Hall, told The Independent: “British Gas’s socially irresponsible decision comes at the most financially pressured time of year.“For families on tight margins and low incomes, being able to top up their meter with what little money they have is essential to keep safe and warm.“This decision risks children, older people and other vulnerable people being left in the cold and dark, and increases the likelihood parents and pensioners will have to make the impossible decision between food and fuel.“We urge British Gas to do the right thing and reverse this decision immediately.”Streets Kitchen, a homeless charity, said the rise would hit the poorest hardest this winter.“Some people don’t have £5, which means they’ll have nothing to put on their meter in an emergency,” the charity said, adding that 16 million people in the UK had less than £100 in savings.Children in low-income families facing ‘hunger and shame’, study finds“Those who only have a few quid to their name until pay day will no longer be able to top up their payment meter.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think that Jeremy has been badly advised. I think there have been times when we have made decisions and that hasn\u0027t been what has been briefed out to the media.That has undermined him, and drained away, I think too often, his authenticity, which was something which was so important and resonated so much with people in 2017.And I think that there have been a number of mistakes made between 2017 and 2019 that undermined him so fundamentally. As I say, I think he was let down.Asked who she was referring to, she said: I call out the people.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.

When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would mean the longtime leader leaving in 2024.Over the last few years, Moscow has speculated about the manoeuvres he may take to get around this restriction: a repeat of the switch he carried out with Dmitry Medvedev in 2008 a new role, perhaps as head of an overarching\u0026nbspsecurity council even as head of a new unified state with Belarus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis\u0026nbspwas the first time that he suggested that the clause itself could be amended, or removed.The remarks, which were made\u0026nbspin the course of his traditional annual press conference, seemed to be deliberately\u0026nbspambiguous. They could\u0026nbspbe interpreted in one of two ways: either removing the clause, or\u0026nbspremoving the consecutive part, and therefore potentially\u0026nbspstanding down in 2024.\u0026nbspMargarita\u0026nbspSimonyan, the\u0026nbspuber-loyal\u0026nbspeditor of Kremlin-funded RT, said the\u0026nbspcomments should be interpreted as\u0026nbspa signal that the president\u0026nbspwould not be seeking re-election. If anyone doubted whether the Boss was going for another presidential term... he won\u0027t.\u0026nbspKonstantin Gaaze, a\u0026nbspcommentator and former government advisor agreed.\u0026nbspMr Putin\u0026nbsphad offered a clear\u0026nbspindication that he did not intend to carry on as president past 2024, he said.\u0026nbspHaving talked about consecutive terms, it\u0026nbspwould be impossible for him\u0026nbspin 2023 to turn around and say that he\u0027s staying, he told The Independent.\u0026nbspMr Putin\u0027s annual press marathon, now in its 15th instalment,\u0026nbspis the president’s annual opportunity to portray himself as a wise, radical, world leader.\u0026nbspOver the years, his conferences have grown in scope: both in duration and the number of journalists attending.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since 2004, it’s been three hours at a minimum. Today’s event lasted nearly four and a half hours, with a\u0026nbsprecord 1895 journalists accredited.\u0026nbspReducing the country\u0027s\u0026nbsppress\u0026nbspcorps to squealing in\u0026nbspa battle for\u0026nbspattention,\u0026nbspthe show plays into an image of a leader taking control. Officially, no question is off-limits. In reality, the\u0026nbspKremlin keeps a tight grip on the narrative.\u0026nbspSome of the questions are obviously vetted. Others are fielded from a largely obliging group of provincial press corps, thrilled for the chance to air regional issues.\u0026nbspOccasionally, however,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspsharp question finds its way through. This year, that honour fell to a BBC Russian journalist, who asked the president to\u0026nbspcomment on the business dealings and state contracts of his two adult daughters. It appeared that Mr Putin\u0027s\u0026nbsppress secretary had been tricked by the journalist\u0027s\u0026nbspsign, which read family.\u0026nbspMr Putin, who has refused to confirm the has any daughters, became visibly angry. He\u0026nbspsidestepped the question and told the journalist to do better work.As with previous years, the Russian president\u0026nbspoffered his compatriots a bright new future — with giant\u0026nbspleaps forward\u0026nbspin education, medicine and science.\u0026nbspThere was even a hint that New Year’s Eve may be made a national holiday.\u0026nbspAs with previous years, it was\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspa moment to shake a fist at the rest of the world —\u0026nbspintent on denying Russians that future.\u0026nbspMoscow\u0027s increasing problems on the international arena were the result of it becoming a force to be reckoned with,\u0026nbspthe president\u0026nbspsaid. Sanctions against Russia\u0026nbspwere politically-motivated. The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) decision to ban Russian sportsmen from competing over doping\u0026nbspwas an “unjust” decision\u0026nbspthat “flew in the face of common sense.”\u0026nbspOn Ukraine, the\u0026nbspRussian president said\u0026nbsphe would not alter his conditions for peace. There would be no revisiting of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspMinsk-II\u0026nbsppeace deal signed in February 2015, he said. Many aspects of the agreement, signed while thousands of Ukrainian soldiers were trapped behind enemy lines, remain politically toxic in\u0026nbspKiev.\u0026nbspMr Putin, who understands this, nonetheless doubled down on the most controversial of the agreement\u0027s\u0026nbspprovisions: a constitutional change reflecting a “special status” for the conflict zone. This is a red line for the Ukrainians who fear it may be used to ferment instability elsewhere in the country.\u0026nbspWe keep saying that we need to fix the special status in the constitution,” Mr Putin\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLater, Mr Putin rejected the very federal model he demanded of Ukraine.\u0026nbspHistory showed they do\u0026nbspnot work in Russia, he said. He criticised Vladimir Lenin, who, he said undermined\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcentral command ... and laid\u0026nbspthe groundwork for the country to begin falling apart.\u0026nbspThe Russian president had\u0026nbspmore time for Stalin, however\u0026nbsp— the European Parliament was “wrong to equate Stalinism with Totalitarianism” — and for Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s volatile head of state accused of masterminding the deaths and torture of hundreds of gay men. Mr Kadyrov deserved to be honoured as a “Russian hero,” he said — and this despite fighting Russian soldiers in the Chechen wars.\u0026nbspAs for his own historical legacy, which now may or may not be extended past\u0026nbsp2024, Mr Putin refused to be drawn.\u0026nbspIt was not something he thought about, he insisted.\u0026nbsp“I’ll leave it to the next generation to decide,” he said.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So instead he’s issued an inadequate non-apology, claiming responsibility for his “share” of the defeat.His share ! His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote.

Rebecca Long-Bailey — so inept even her own party members refer to her as Rebecca Wrong Daily.We could even co-ordinate and demand that they keep Magic Grandpa as boss. I mean, the party still seems to be in a state of denial. It was nothing to do with Corbyn! The voters loved him and loved our policies! We only didn’t win because of, er, Tory lies. The voters are thick, you see. Oh — and Brexit.For a very long time I was a member of the Labour Party. The main reason I left is the main reason nobody voted for it this time around. It is no longer the party of the poor and the working class.It has become a fringe group for metropolitan, middle-class liberals.Look at the only places it did well. Cambridge, Putney, Canterbury. Ha, bring on the revolution, then.“Are we manning the barricades, Cressida  Can I finish my Yakult first ”In a sense it doesn’t really matter who wins their leadership race. Labour lost not just because of the idiotic Corbyn or because of Brexit. It goes far deeper than that.It is the culture of the party. It despises everything its old voter base stands for. Even the moderates.It cannot abide patriotism, for a start. Its old voters are rather proud of Britain, and what Britain stands for. Corbyn and his allies hate our country.The traditional Labour voters believe in the traditional family, too. They have no time for identity politics and political correctness. They want a better deal, but don’t buy into all of the infantile agit-prop that goes along with today’s Labour Party.How the hell do you change that when the far-Left munchkins of Momentum still hold all the power There are still good people in the Labour Party. Some of them — like the brilliant Caroline Flint — lost their seats last week because of what Labour has become.Look at it now. Corbyn is STILL the leader. There is nothing they can do to get rid of him. He’s called for a period of reflection. It didn’t take the voters very long to reflect, did it We need a new party which represents working class people, especially away from London. That’s why I joined the Social Democratic Party.And we can happily leave the Labour Party to its “reflections”. Its support for terrorists, its loathing of the West. It STILL thinks it got its policies right.Even with a new leader it will still be terminally deluded.SO, is the BBC biased Welsh gob on a stick Huw Edwards thinks it is impeccably neutral.

With little understanding of, or sympathy for, industry, business, the countryside or of course Brexiteers.”As Buerk pointed out, the BBC’s worldview is formed by the people who work for it.An estimated  per cent of them were against Brexit and there are plenty of objective studies which bear out a huge bias against Brexit.Go get ’em, BoJo.The advice is to always park where there are lots of people nearby .And in a well lit area.

Don’t believe them when they’re trying to flog you something.

Years of being told we’re all bigoted, racist and uneducated, I suppose.My we said she was more thrilled by the election result than she was by the birth of our daughter, which I think is pushing it a bit.Anyway, Boris Johnson has proven that he is a very canny politician indeed.He won the Mayor of London elections twice – by wooing the most right-on liberal electorate in Europe. And then he appealed to exactly the opposite tranche of voters to win the election last week.Huge credit, mind, to his adviser Dominic Cummings. A very sharp bloke – and from the North East. He never had any doubts about the result.What, being called a “smarty-pants”  If you end up troubled by having been called something like that  years previously, I would argue that your problems lie a lot deeper and were not actually caused by the insult.Shouldn’t we be trying to instil a degree of resilience among you people  Rather than feeling “triggered” at every single thing that’s said to them TURKEY is rapidly becoming the pariah state of the world.Its horrible government allows the genocidal terrorists Hamas to plot attacks on Israel from within Istanbul.The Turkish leader, Recep Erdogan, recently rolled out the red carpet for the Islamist maniacs of Hamas.A few years ago we were anxious to welcome Turkey into the European Union.Now we should impose sanctions on the country.Friends of anti-Jewish terrorists are no friends of ours.CHRISTMAS is the time of year when you open a bottle from the fridge expecting a nice glass of wine and it’s actually the we’s non-alcoholic “Christmas Mulled Berry Punch”, which tastes like a Moroccan’s gusset.The time of year when the rellies turn up, like not very wise men, each bearing their present of a bloody panettone which nobody anywhere will eat.When the awful Lonely This Christmas, by Mud, gets dragged out of its tomb – I’ve hated that song for  years.When good, God-fearing Christian people kick the s**t out of each other in an attempt to secure the last PlayStation, or something, in the sales.

RUIs are what the Law Society’s head of justice has described as a “major scandal” waiting to erupt.I know Home Secretary Priti Patel will have a lot on her plate as Parliament begins, but this ought to be one of her top priorities.The shocking overuse of RUI came to light on Wednesday, after -year-old thug Ewan Ireland was jailed for le for the murder of solicitor Peter Duncan in a Newcastle shopping centre in August.Peter’s misfortune was to have brushed past Ireland in the doorway of a shop, an act which Ireland took as a slight.He took hold of the screwdriver he had stolen minutes earlier and drove it into Mr Duncan’s heart.It is a tale of mindless, casual violence which has become all too common in modern Britain as the jumped-up egos of young men rage against anyone who gets in their way.But what makes it all the more disturbing is that Ireland’s tendency for extreme violence was well known to police and the courts, yet still he was allowed to walk the streets.While other boys of his age are busy studying for A-levels, Ireland had already amassed a formidable range of criminal qualications.He had  convictions for  dferent offences. He was on conditional discharge for an offence of battery and on bail for a charge of affray for threatening to slash another boy’s Achilles’ tendon.Yet in spite of all this, he had been released under investigation for a robbery.He is not the only violent criminal to have been sent on his way by police. In September last year Alan Martin, of Sunderland, was released by police after his estranged we accused him of raping her.Not only did officers release him, they also ed to him the keys to his we’s house. He promptly ed to the address, attacked her with a hammer and strangled her before taking his own le, too.Astonishingly, Northumbria Police were later cleared by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. No one seems to want to take responsibility. No doubt it will be the same next time, too.Since April , , violent criminals have been released under investigation, Home Office figures reveal.Unlike police bail, no restrictions have been placed on these people. They are not banned from visiting particular places, they have not had to raise a deposit, hand over their passport or report to police at regular intervals. Nor, unlike police bail, is there any time limit on RUI, so police are under no pressure to bring charges quickly.The misuse of RUI is a hangover from Amber Rudd’s time as Home Secretary. It was her Policing and Crime Act  which stopped police putting people on bail for periods of more than  days. True, something needed to be done. The case of former Radio  DJ Paul Gambaccini had inspired the rule change.He had been held on bail for a whole year as police investigated accusations of historic sex offences which turned out to be without foundation.Unable to put criminals on bail for more than  days, police forces took to releasing them under investigation instead.That might be perfectly reasonable in the case of relatively minor crimes which take a long time to investigate, but it is hardly an appropriate way to treat suspected murderers and rapists, especially those with a long history of violent offences.At the very least, people suspected of violent offences — and for which good evidence exists that those offences really did take place — need to be monitored.As for people who have been released on licence while serving sentences for previous convictions, there should be no argument at all — they should be taken back to prison without hesitation.Ministers like to talk tough on crime, especially around election time, but behind the scenes they get caught in the stranglehold of the liberal establishment.Punishments get weakened, prisoners get released early.Disgracefully, former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the sentencing system as the “benign deception of the public”, who, unaware of the soft reality, assume that criminals are being properly punished.But there is nothing benign about serial offenders being freed to rape and murder when police and the courts know full well their records.During the election campaign, Boris Johnson finally called an end to the deception.Braving an onslaught from the nation’s liberal consciences, he announced that prisoners will no longer be eligible for automatic early release — something which allowed the London Bridge killer Usman Khan to embark on his murderous spree.But the Johnson Government should not end there.It needs to stop the police releasing violent offenders back into the community without any restrictions on their movements nor any requirement ever to report to a police station.Liberals like to say that we can’t solve crime just by jailing people. On the contrary, had Ewan Ireland been kept out of circulation after his first offence it would alone have meant  fewer crimes in Newcastle over the past four years.It is hard enough to catch criminals.But to release those we do catch, giving them the freedom to embark on long crime sprees, is plain madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our little knight begins to speak.He pronounces one syllable after another, not all of them, and most of the time we have to guess what he means but its better and better. Its a wonderful progress.The family added theof movement in his limbs has been a very painful experience for the child.They said: He also begins to move his four limbs now. It is very dficult to see it concerning his left arm and hand, but its really slowly beginning to move.However, as he begins to move, sensations come back and he feels more pain, above all during the night, which is very exhausting for everybody, but he is very courageous and we stay strong for him.In the message to generous supporters, the family thanked everyone who has contributed to the fund.The statement added: Your help makes it possible to offer our son the best rehabilitation, and for us to take care of our little boy everyday, to stay with him as long as he needs with the best doctors and therapists.Thank you also to keep us strong with all your kind messages. You cant imagine how much it is helpful.Bravery admitted a charge of attempted murder earlier in December at the Old Bailey in London and will be sentenced next February.After throwing the little lad from the building he approached a member of staff and said: I think Ive murdered someone, Ive just thrown someone off the balcony.When Bravery, from Ealing, West London, was arrested he told police he had travelled to the London gallery with the intention of hurting someone so he could be on the TV news that evening.He said: I wanted to be on the news, who I am and why I did it, so when it is official no-one can say anything .Bravery then said he heard voices tell him he had to hurt or kill people and wanted to prove a point to every idiot who said he didnt have mental health issues.Appearing via video link from Broadmoor Hospital at the Old Bailey, Bravery could be seen closing his eyes and speaking under his breath during the hearing.The victim, who was visiting the UK from France, was forced to spend two months in intensive care and left unable to speak or eat after the horror attack on August .His French mum and dad dubbed their son their “little knight” as they revealed previously he could only smile to communicate.CPS prosecutor Emma Jones said: This devastating and shocking incident at the Tate Modern on  August of this year changed the lives of Bravery’s young victim and his family forever.The boy was singled out by Bravery who threw him from the viewing  intending to kill him.That he survived the five storey fall was extraordinary.Eye witness accounts and CCTV footage, along with Bravery’s admissions at the time of the arrest that his actions were pre-planned, meant he had little choice but to accept responsibility for his actions. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former Labour MP who sued a union for libel has won a High Court fight and been awarded £, damages. Anna Turley had sued Unite and blogger Stephen Walker, the owner of the left-wing Skwawkbox site, over what she called a politically-motivated attack. Ms Turley said a  article on Skwawkbox, which contained a press statement from Unite, libelled her by conveying the meaning that she had acted dishonestly when submitting an application to join the union. She also says Unite misused her private information. Unite bosses and Mr Walker fought the case and said Ms Turley had been dishonest and was not fit to be an MP. They said the article was true or justied in the public interest. But Mr Justice Nicklin, who oversaw a High Court trial in London in November, ruled today in favour of the former MP - who lost her seat in Redcar to the Tories last week. Unite is now planning to appeal the High Courtaposs judgement. Ms Turley had wanted more than £,. Ms Turley today accused the defendants of frankly appalling attempts at character assassination during the court case. And she accused Unite of a colossal waste of membersapos money by funding Skwawkboxaposs legal costs adding: I hope serious questions will be asked of the leadership of the Union by its members. She said: The judge himself concluded that ‘the Defendants’ conduct during the trial has seriously aggravated the harm to the Claimant’s reputation and her distress’. This has been an extremely stressful and unpleasant process, and one I never imagined I would be engaged in with a Trade Union. The article related to a Unite membership application Ms Turley made in December . Mr Justice Nicklin heard how Ms Turley had applied to be a Unite member under a Community membership category. He was told that Uniteaposs Community section was aimed at people not in paid employment and cost p a week. A barrister representing Unite said Ms Turley had been willing to conceal, mislead and deceive. Anthony Hudson QC said Ms Turley wanted to vote against Unite general secretary Len McCluskey in an election without being noticed and without the union knowing she was an MP. Ms Turley had links to a WhatsApp group of Labour MPs, known as the Birthday Club, who were opposed to Jeremy Corbynaposs leadership, the judge heard. Mr Hudson said her application flowed from a Birthday Club WhatsApp discussion.Ms Turley said the Skwawkbox article made  and defamatory allegations about her and impugned her honesty. I had not dishonestly joined the Community section of Unite and there was no reason to suspect me of being dishonest, she told the judge. I believed I was entitled to join it. She added: I am not dishonest and have not lied or sought to mislead. My reputation for honesty and integrity are of the utmost importance to me. They go to the root of who I am and why I am in public service. Ms Turley said in todayaposs statement: I am very pleased with today’s verdict, and to be able to say that I have won my libel action against Unite the Union and Skwawkbox. The judge found that that the article caused serious harm to my reputation and there were no reasonable grounds to suspect any form of dishonesty on my part. For Skwawkbox to have publicly accused me of this in their article was deeply damaging to my professional reputation and extremely hurtful.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Government’s £, fee for registering children as British citizens has been struck down as unlawful by the High Court, in what has been described as a “landmark ruling.” The Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizensargued the exorbitant registration fee - for an application which costs the Home Office just £ to process - effectively removes childrenaposs entitlement to citizenship. In a judgment delivered on Thursday, Mr Justice Jay said that the fee was unlawful because the Home Office had failed to have regard to the best interests of children affected by the level of the fee. The PRCBC says that many children who are entitled to citizenship, having been born in the UK and lived here for their first  years, are prevented from applying because of the excessively high fee. The case, which was supported by Amnesty International UK, was brought on behalf of two children identied only as O who is  years old, and A, three, both of whom were born in the UK and have lived here their entire lives. The judge ruled that the regulations which set the fee are unlawful in that respect to the extent that they set the fee for registration applications brought by children at £,. He added that there was no evidence that the Home Office had identied where the best interests of children seeking registration lie, has begun to characterise those interests properlyhas identied that the level of fee creates practical dficulties for many. Mr Justice Jay said the evidence before the court showed that for a substantial number of children, a fee of £, is simply unaffordable, which made the children affected feel alienated, excluded, isolated, apossecond-bestapos, insecure and not fully assimilated into the culture and social fabric of the UK. The judge added that O and her mother could only afford the fee by taking steps which to my mind would be wholly unreasonable. Mr Justice Jay dismissed the PRCBCaposs argument that the level of the fee was unlawful because it renders a childaposs entitlement to British citizenship nugatory. But he said that he was referring that issue to be considered in the Supreme Courtthat court so advises. The judge also gave the Home Office permission to appeal against his ruling. In a statement after the ruling, Solange Valdez-Symonds, co-founder of the PRCBC, said: It is signicant that the court has recognised British citizenship is the right of these and thousands of children and that the consequences of blocking their registration rights is alienating and harmful. While that recognition is a great step forward, the fact remains that tens of thousands of British children are growing up in this country deprived of their rights to its citizenship, including by this shamelessly profiteering fee. For too long, children and their citizenship rights have not been respected. That must change. The Government should make an immediate start by ending the use of this fee to raise revenue for the Home Office.  Responding to the judgment, O - who told the court of her fear that her school friends would find out that she is not British like them - said: I am glad I got to tell the court my story. I was born in this country and have lived here all my le. I feel as British as any of my friends and itaposs not right that I am excluded from citizenship by a huge fee. I want to be able to do all the things my friends can. I donapost want to have to worry they will find out I donapost have a British passport and think that means I am not the same as them. Carol Bohmer, chair of the PRCBC, said: This is a landmark ruling. But the fight for justice for children born and growing up in the UK goes on. She added: The damage done to thousands of children is dreadful and still far from fully quantiable. So much more still needs to be done so that children, their parents and carers, know their citizenship rights and to ensure the many barriers to exercising these rights are removed, including this profit-making fee.

Back in October the Monarch delivered the Toriesapos words during a ceremony filled with royal pomp and extravagance, wearing a tiara and a formal gown and robe. However today was a much quieter and relaxed event, with the Queen opting to wear a green dress, coat and hat instead of the traditional outfit. The procession itself was also reduced and cars were used instead of horse-drawn carriages. Prince Charles wore a suit instead of his service unorm. Many fans were disappointed to not see the full royal display, but the decision was made after an extraordinary few months of British politics. According to the website, the unique circumstances surrounding the election were part of the reason, combined with the fact itaposs happening just a week before Christmas. Itaposs not the first time in recent years weaposve seen this kind of ceremony, and the  State Opening following a similar approach. Under Thersea May, the Queenaposs Speech was scheduled for just a few days after Trooping the Colour - the Monarchaposs official birthday celebrations.  Both of these events obviously involve a lot of planning and organisation, so the decision was made to make it a quieter affair. It was the first time since  sheaposd done the speech in day dress. In Octoberaposs opening the Queen broke a key tradition she has followed since taking the throne in  - not wearing the Imperial State Crown. Instead, she placed the heavy and priceless crown on a table next to her instead. The Imperial State Crown was originally made for King George VIaposs coronation in .  The design was based on the crown worn by Queen Victoria in , featuring a number of priceless gemstones including the Second Star of Africa, the Black Princeaposs Ruby, the Stuart Sapphire and St Edwardaposs Sapphire. In total there are , diamonds in silver mounts,  sapphires,  emeralds and  pearls. However it is very, very heavy - so itaposs hardly surprising that at  the Queen decided it might be time to swap to a lighter alternative.

The Prime Minister trumped Bills which will ensure the most serious violent offenders - including terrorists - serve longer prison terms after the London Bridge attack. A Royal Commission will be established to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process, and the Government will enshrine in law a commitment on NHS funding. Addressing MPs after the speech, Mr Johnson vowed that his Government would work flat out to deliver a new golden age for the UK, as he insisted his vision is for the long term. This is not a programme for one year or one parliament - it is a blueprint for the future of Britain, he said. But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady sounded a note of caution - saying working people will want to check the small print before trusting this government’s promises. So what are the details in the small print  Weaposve had a look at  points you should know. Boris Johnson was been accused of rowing back on his promise to implement a £. minimum wage by  for everyone over the age of .It was the flagship policy announcement at the Tory conference, where Chancellor Sajid Javid proclaimed it would show the Tories are the workersapos party and help million workers.It is to be achieved by pegging the wage to two-thirds of median earnings, not % as it is now. But the small print of the Queenaposs Speech shows there is a sneaky get-out clause. It says the change to two-thirds of median earnings will only happen provided economic conditions allow. That is likely to prompt speculation thatthere is an economic downturn, the rise wonapost happen.Chi Onwurah, shadow business minister, told HuffPost UK: “In the very first moments of his new government Boris Johnson is already breaking promises he made during the election.. A shake-up of the entire constitution  The Queenaposs Speech plans a massive overhaul of Britainaposs constitution just a week after winning power. The Prime Minister announced that he would set up a new commission which could radically alter how Britain works. He will use the excuse of restoring trust in politics - even though he was widely considering to have undermined it during his time at No  so far. In the small print, the Commission promises to examine the broader aspects of the constitution in depth and develop proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. But the changes could prompt immediate fears that the Tory government was attempting to bolster its own power. The new unit could redraw constituency boundaries to reduce the number of MPs from  to , a move which could favour the Conservatives. He could also repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act meaning he could call an election when he wants to. There could be a move to repeal the Human Rights Act, replacing it with a bill of rights that could potentially lower protections. And in the wake of Mr Johnsonaposs Supreme Court loss, Britainaposs most senior judges could be made more accountable to Parliament - which could undermine the independence of the judiciary. Best for Britain chief executive Naomi Smith said: Johnsonaposs proposed constitution, democracy and rights commission should set alarm bells ringing for anyone who believes that Parliament must be able to act as a brake on a runaway government. We must be hyper-vigilant to any chipping away of the checks-and-balances that keep our democracy ing. No later flatly denied Supreme Court judges could become political appointees. . Britain could get new laws on treason  The small print of a law on espionage says the government will look at the case for updating treason laws. There is no further detail but it raises the spectre of new offences being allowed under laws that date back to Medieval times. MPs including Tory Tom Tugendhat and Labouraposs Khalid Mahmood have previously argued there is a case for updating the  Treason Act. Itaposs true that itaposs out of date. The last person to be tried for treason in the UK was in . But the Law Commission previously said treason law had ceased to be of contemporary relevance. And reviving it may prompt fears of a law that was killed off long ago coming back into being. . Workersapos rights pledges just arenapost clear yet Thereaposs a new Employment Bill which the Tories say will safeguard workersapos rights after Brexit .But the thing is, there isnapost enough detail on it yet to be clear about what those safeguards will be. The original Brexit Bill in October had promised that each time ministers make a new law in future, they would have to commit that in their view it doesnapost regress from EU workersapos rights. If they could not do so, they would have had to make a statement saying the new law might regress from EU workersapos rights. Thataposs now been dropped from the Brexit Bill. But it doesnapost yet, according to the Queenaposs Speech notes, appear in the new Employment Bill. Instead, the Queenaposs Speech makes a more general statement that the new Bill will protect and enhance workersapos rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work. Tim Roache, GMB General Secretary, said: “The Prime Minister claims he will protect and enhance workers’ rights but his record on keeping his promises leaves a lot to be desired. We’ll be holding him to account.  . People will be forced to show ID to vote   The Queenaposs Speech confirms measures will be implemented to force voters to show photo ID before being allowed to vote. Hundreds of people were denied their right to vote in last year’s local elections after ministers forced through a pilot scheme, despite warnings it could disenfranchise older voters and people from minority groups. The trial, which was held in eight council areas, resulted in  people being turned away. That was despite official figures showing there were just eight allegations of people lying about who they are at a polling station - known as personation - in . That was down from  in ,  in ,  in  and  in , the Electoral Commission figures show. The Queenaposs Speech says people without an approved form of photographic ID will be able to request an identity document. But campaigners say the move will hit low-income and vulnerable voters less likely to have the right paperwork. There are other measures too that critics say could benefit the Tories - letting ex-pats vote for leand shaking up constituency boundaries. . Thereaposs still no solution for social care The Queenaposs Speech promises to begin urgent work on a cross-party solution to social care. But despite Boris Johnson saying he had a plan ready to go, there is no detail - apart from a commitment that no one will have to sell their home.Dan Scorer of the learning disability charity Mencap said: Cross party consensus is a good idea, but they need to get on with it. The extra £ billion sounds a lot, but is nowhere near enough Dr Jenner Dixon chief executive of the Health Foundation said: With growing numbers of people unable to access the care they need, there is no time to waste. Fundamental reform of social care should be the immediate priority - the government must now grasp the nettle. Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive at Alzheimer’s Society, said “The state of dementia care is in crisis. The Prime Minister committed to end the injustice when he met Barbara Windsor. Where’s the action  Jonathan Blades of the MS Society said: “It’s been years since we were first promised a plan on how to fix our failing social care system, and we’re still in the dark.

The Prime Minister today claimed the seismic election has given way to the most radical Queenaposs Speech in a generation that will release the country from the stranglehold of indecision. While the last State Opening of Parliament in October was a gloried pre-manesto thataposd never pass, the Tories now have a thumping majority of . That means these laws will actually happen. All  Bills proposed last time are effectively repeated today, plus more than a dozen new ones from the Tory manesto. Some are about Brexit . Others are good measures including to make flexible working default, finally scrapping aposno-faultapos evictions for renters and cutting business rates on pubs, cinemas and gig venues. But others still will worry those who fear Johnson is using his new-found power to make sweeping ideological changes to the nation over the next one to two years. Just days after he won the election, the Queenaposs Speech confirms a ban on all-out rail strikes, a radical overhaul of the constitution, and measures that critics fear could lock left-wing parties further from power. So what is in the Queenaposs Speech and what does it all mean  Hereaposs an at-a-glance guide.New Queenaposs Speech Bills since the election Huge overhaul of the UKaposs constitution Boris Johnson plans a massive overhaul of Britainaposs constitution just a week after winning power. The Prime Minister announced that he would set up a new commission which could radically alter how Britain works. He will use the excuse of restoring trust in politics - even though he was widely considering to have undermined it during his time at No  so far. Mr Johnsonaposs Queenaposs Speech promises to examine the broader aspects of the constitution in depth and develop proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. But the changes could prompt immediate fears that the Tory government was attempting to bolster its own power. The new unit could redraw constituency boundaries to reduce the number of MPs from  to , a move which could favour the Conservatives. He could also repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act meaning he could call an election when he wants to. There could be a move to repeal the Human Rights Act, replacing it with a bill of rights that could potentially lower protections. And in the wake of Mr Johnsonaposs Supreme Court loss, Britainaposs most senior judges could be made more accountable to Parliament - which could undermine the independence of the judiciary.  Bans on all-out rail strikes and public sector boycotts The Tories will crack down hard on left-wing causes with bans on both all-out rail strikes and aposboycottapos campaigns in the public sector. A new law will hit unions with damages or injunctionsthey do not comply with a aposMinimum Service Agreementapos to keep trains running, even during a strike. Unions have compared the plan to something from a right-wing junta. Meanwhile public sector organisations will be banned from boycotting goods or services from foreign countries including Israel.  Flexible working could be the default for all staff Flexible working could become the default position for all staff under new rules planned by the government. As part of the Queenaposs Speech Boris Johnsonaposs Employment Bill would give employees more power over when they work. Currently employees can apply for flexible workingthey’ve worked continuously for the same employer for the last  weeks. The employer then has three months - or longeragreed with the staff member applying - to make a decision. But the new rules, which are subject to consultation, would make it the default - unless employers have good reason not to. Under the governmentaposs definition flexible working can refer to job sharing, working from home, working part time, flexitime, annualised hours, staggered hours, phased retirement and compressed hours.  NHS funding pledge written into law An NHS Funding Bill will write the PMaposs £bn-a-year cash termsincrease in NHS funding by  into law. This is a political stunt to show to voters that Boris Johnson will keep his election pledge, but it has very little meaning beyond that. Itaposs up to Boris Johnsonhe wants to keep his promises andhe doesnapost he can just repeal the Bill anyway.  Hospital car parking charges removed - for some The Queen confirmed plans to scrap some hospital car parking charges. But not all. The Government will prioritise and carefully define those groups subject to a more detailed assessment of financial impact. But they will include blue badge holders frequent outpatient attendees visitors with relatives who are gravely ill or have an extended stay in hospital, or carers of such where appropriate and staff working shts that mean public transport cannot be used. An end to aposno-faultapos evictions - and a letime deposit A Rentersapos Reform Bill will end no-fault evictions - something which the Tory government was accused of dither over. Landlords will however get more rights to gain possession of their property through the courts to make it quicker and easier for them to get their property back sooner. And there will be a letime deposit which tenants carry around with them so they donapost have to save for a new one each time they move.  A cut in business rates to help pubs, cinemas and gig venues Pubs, cinemas and small businesses are set will see their business rates halved next year, the government has confirmed. The Bill will aim to support Britainaposs struggling High Streets with a series of new measures will see smaller businesses pay less in tax. The % discount - announced as part of the Queensapos speech -  is targeted ar retailers, such as shops, restaurants, hairdressers, and pubs - raising the current discount of % off. The government claim that nine out of  independent firms will qualy for the relief, which is available to retailers with a rateable value below £, – giving them a saving of up to £, in total. For the first time, independent cinemas and music venues will also qualy, in a bid to safeguard local entertainment. A current £, relief for local newspapers will also be extended by another year, to help keep  titles going.Tougher sentences for terrorists after London Bridge A Counter TerrorismBill will give the worst terrorist offenders a -year minimum jail term. And the possibility of early release from custody will be removed for any offenders who receive an Extended Determinate Sentence. The announcement was rushed into existence by Boris Johnson after the London Bridge attack - whose culprit was a convicted terrorist out on licence. Mr Johnson was condemned by the father of one of the victims, Jack Merritt, for politicising the attack.  A crackdown on foreign spies amid Russia fears Intelligence chiefs are to be given sweeping powers to disrupt and target foreign spies living and working in the UK. The Espionage Bill, drawn up in the wake of the Russian Novichok attack in Salisbury, will aim to clamp down on hostile states’ activities. The catch-all law will close down legal loopholes to ensure it is always illegal to carry out the covert operation in the UK - in a bid to thwart potential rival powers such as Russia or China. Work began on the law after Theresa May promised to tackle Russia’s shadowy GRU military intelligence service after the Salisbury nerve attack. But there were reportedly concerns from some parts of the security community that they lacked the legal framework to pursue iniduals involved in activity that was clearly being done in an attempt to aid a foreign power, or disrupt people the UK. The bill is supposed to give authorities wide-reaching powers similar to the US’s Foreign Agents Registration Act, which forces any agent of a foreign power to disclose themselves and their activities.  A crackdown on Grenfell-style building owners A Building Safety Bill and Fire Safety Bill will strengthen enforcement and sanctions against Grenfell-style building owners who do not comply with a new safety regime. But it stops short of saying there will be criminal sanctions as ministers suggested previously. Compensation for Thomas Cook customers - but a watering down  There will also be a Bill to ensure those who suffered le-changing injuries for which Thomas Cook would have been liable still get compensation after the firm collapsed. But thereaposs no sign of a law that had been announced in October, which would have attempted to stop a repeat of the Thomas Cook debacle by giving the Civil Aviation Authority oversight over airlines in distress.  Royal Commissions and major reviews On justice, a Royal Commission to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system will be established. On security, a review of the Official Secrets Act is promised to decideit needs overhauling in the wake of the Salisbury chemical weapons attack as well as considering whether there is a case for updating treason laws. And an integrated security, defence and foreign policy review will take place to reassess the nationaposs place in the world. A Bill on online harms Ministers will prepare legislation to improve internet safety for children and vulnerable people. But thereaposs no full Bill announced yet. There will however be interim codes of practice and a media literacy strategy to stay safe online. An end to vexatious claims against troops On defence, proposals will be brought forward to tackle vexatious claims that undermine our armed forces. Things that arenapost in the Queenaposs Speech that should be His pledges on workersapos rights after Brexit Boris Johnson appears to have dropped pledges he made in the autumn to safeguard workersapos rights after Brexit. Ministers pledged in October to include certain vows in the EUBill . Signals from No suggest theyaposve been dropped. This week, Tory Michael Gove insisted itaposd all be fine because there was a separate Bill in the speech to deal with workersapos rights. Well, there is. But it doesnapost actually fulfil Boris Johnsonaposs promises on workersapos rights. Back in October, the government said ministers would make a statement explaining where any new laws could affect rights - and be forced to report regularly on plans to mirror new EU laws. Yet todayaposs briefing just says the new Bill will protect and enhance workersapos rights as the UK leaves the EU. A proper solution to social care The Tories have kicked the can down the road on social care yet again with no firm plans for the ailing sector contained in the Queenaposs Speech. Despite saying he had a solution on the steps of No, the Queenaposs Speech instead pledges a cross-party approach to be taken forward urgently. The one red line is that people wonapost be forced to sell their homes to pay for care. Theresa May  was accused of kicking the can down the road after she repeatedly delayed plans for a ‘green paper’ on social care first planned for summer . Her blighted social care plans in the  general election campaign were dubbed a “dementia tax” and blamed for the Tories losing their majority in the  general election. Things from the last Queenaposs Speech that made a comeback  Voter ID crackdown to aposrig electionsapos Boris Johnson was accused of using the Queenaposs Speech as a “blatant” attempt to rig the result of the next election. The Queenaposs Speech confirms measures will be implemented to force voters to show photo ID before being allowed to vote. Hundreds of people were denied their right to vote in last year’s local elections after ministers forced through a pilot scheme, despite warnings it could disenfranchise older voters and people from minority groups. The trial, which was held in eight council areas, resulted in  people being turned away. That was despite official figures showing there were just eight allegations of people lying about who they are at a polling station - known as personation - in . That was down from  in ,  in ,  in  and  in , the Electoral Commission figures show. Domestic abuse reforms finally- again The Tories will bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill - which fell as a result of Mr Johnsonaposs unlawful suspension of Parliament. This law was introduced under Theresa May but still wasnapost implemented, to the fury of campaigners. It will stop abusers from being able to cross-examine their victims in the family courts. Victims will be assumed eligible for special measures in criminal courts, like giving evidence via video link. It will create a statutory definition of domestic abuse to include physical violence, emotional abuse, economic abuse and coercive control. And a Domestic Abuse Commissioner will monitor the response of councils and the justice system. Divorce reforms finally- again Plans for aposquickieapos orces will also come forward again thanks to a Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill after being stalled under the Tories. Reforms will remove the need to prove bad conduct or a period of separation. Instead couples will be able to just tell a court their marriage has irretrievably broken down. And an obstructive partner will no longer be able to contest a orce from happening. In those measuresapos place will be a -week waiting period between the start of proceedings and the final order for a orce.  Bills to put the Brexit deal into law The EUBill will implement Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal with the EU by January . It includes the transition period, running to December , where we continue to follow EU rules and send money to the EU. But there will be a legal block on it being extended, evenwe donapost have a trade deal in time. This risks the UK plunging into no-deal. There are also concerns that it forces customs checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland, and doesnapost include previously-pledged safeguards for workersapos rights . The Fisheries Bill will have powers to control access to UK waters with licences for foreign vessels - which will no longer have the automatic right to access our seas. New powers will impose restrictions on UK fishermen - either quotas or number of days at sea - to replace the current Common Fisheries Policy. Grants would also be available to fishermen to conserve, enhance and restore the marine and aquatic environment. And EU law could be amended to allow the UK to respond to new advice on fish stocks. The Agriculture Bill will set up a seven-year transition period that gradually reduces payments to farmers that came under the EUaposs Common Agricultural Policy. The current subsidy system - which rewards the amount of land owned - will be replaced and focus on action farmers take to farm sustainably and help the environment.  The Trade Bill allows the legal carry-over of trade deals that the UK currently enjoys as an EU member. However, this carrying over is still not automatic and the UK would need to negotiate the transition with inidual countries around the world. The Bill also establishes a new independent UK body to protect British firms against unfair trade practices - like dumping of imports such as Chinese steel.  Crackdown on free movement The Immigration and Social Security Co-OrdinationBill will end free movement after Brexit - including forcing checks on EU citizens who come to Britain from January . It will pave the way for an Australia-style points-based system, which Ukip has previously backed. It would score potential migrants based on their education, skills and expected salary level. EU citizensapos rights to benefits will be reduced to those of non-EU citizens from . There will be a fast-track NHS visa scheme. And the annual quota for seasonal agricultural workers will rise from , to ,. Changes to investment funds This Financial Services Bill will simply the process which allows overseas investment funds to be sold in the UK. The government has trumpeted this as a cutting of red tape, while upholding the UKaposs world-leading standards. But it could prompt fears from some about letting financial markets run free. The Bill also allows for long-term market access to the UK for financial services firms based in Gibraltar. Clarying laws on disputes over international borders This Private International LawBill is designed to clary the law on disputes over kids that stretch across national borders. It involves three treaties - the ,  and  Hague Conventions. They include making it harder for parents who leave the country to evade paying child maintenance and allowing co-operation between governments on family cases. New body to investigate NHS safety incidents A new Health Service Safety Investigations Body will have powers to conduct investigations into NHS incidents that have implications for patient safety, according to a Health Service Safety Investigations Bill. People will be banned from leaking or publishing information held by this body, to ensure witnesses and whistleblowers are more candid. There will also be a duty on the Health Secretary to ensure enough medical examiners are appointed in England. And advice, guidance and training will be provided to local bodies to improve medical probes. Longer sentences for violent criminals and sex offenders Violent criminals and sex offenders will face longer sentences in the Sentencing Bill. The point where prisoners are usually released will be moved from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds - for adults serving at least four years for serious violent and sexual offenders. The focus appears to be a U-turn on previous Tory bids to focus on rehabilitation, which would have removed the need for the shortest sentences in favour of community work. The Bill will also extend the range of reasons a judge can use to slap a whole le prison term on a convicted murderer.  Big rise in sentences for foreign criminals Foreign National Offenders legislation would drastically increase the sentences for foreign criminals whoto the UK in breach of a deportation order. The exact increase however isnapost actually spelt out in the Queenaposs Speech. And since October itaposs been downgraded from a full-blown Bill to just legislation - which could mean itaposs wrapped up in something . Ministers claim the move will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: We have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long. aposHelenaposs Lawapos to end pain of murder victimsapos families  A PrisonersBill will make it easier to deny parole to murderers, or those guilty of manslaughter, who refuse to say where their victims are buried. The same law will apply to people who take indecent photographs of children while refusing to say who those children were. The law will be known as Helenaposs Law after -year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in  - leading to a long campaign by her mother Marie. Her murderer was convicted but has refused to say where he hid her body. Despite claims by ministers, the law wonapost actually force Parole Boards to keep these murderers and paedophiles locked up. Instead it will put a legal obligation on them to take into account the issue when considering release. Preventing serious violence A Serious Violence Bill will put a new legal duty on agencies like councils, schools, social services and health providers to work together and share data to prevent serious violence. This will include introducing an explicit priority in law on serious violence for Community Safety Partnerships. It comes after a surge in kne attacks. But critics are likely to complain it is shting the burden onto cuts-hit local authorities. Protection for police over car chases Police will face a new test to grade their driving due to a Police Protections Bill - which can then be taken into accountthey end up being investigated over a crash. This is in a bid to stop police facing prosecution unfairly for people they injure or kill when taking part in a car chase. The Bill will also force the Home Office to report annually on progress on the Police Covenant. And Special Constableswill be able to to get the same support as members of the Police Federation. Arresting fugitives An ExtraditionBill is designed to make it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives - without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant. The idea is to cut out a waiting period of six to eight hours which fugitives can use to evade justice. Those being arrested must be subject of an Interpol Red notice. Initially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. However the Government will be able to add other countries by minor laws, possibly with minimal scrutiny in Parliament.  Restaurants forced to hand tips to workers  Restaurants will be forced to hand over tips to staff under an Employment Bill - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on abuses. The new law in the Queenaposs Speech will force employers to pass on all gratuities in full and to share fairly any pooled tips. The Tories first promised to tackle the injustice under then-business secretary Sajid Javid who ordered a two-month consultation ending on June , . But Theresa May then failed to bring in the change during her time in office. Today the EmploymentBill also introduces a Code of Practice for restaurants, bars and cafes to make the system transparent. Ten years ago, the Mirror launched our Fair Tips campaign with Unite the Union after a Pizza Express manager was sacked for revealing that the company kept % of tips paid by bank cards as an “administration fee”.  New rules on accessing your money On pensions there were new rules planned around everything from saving to viewing to accessing your money in a Pension Schemes Bill. First was saving – with plans announced for new “collective” workplace pensions schemes. These would see staff and firms pay into a single, shared, pot rather than inidual pots for each person. The idea is that it could be more efficient and offer better value. Second there were plans to force firms to take part in the new “pensions dashboard” project - this is set to be a single location where you can see all your retirement savings at once. But unless everyone gets involved it wonapost work. So plans to force firms to take part are a needed first step. Finally there were new rules planned about where, when and to who you can transfer your pension to. These are needed as there have been cases where scammers have convinced people to move their money, and honest firms have been powerless to stop it. On a more technical front, there were also bigger penalties and criminal offences planned for firms that break pensions rules and better protection for people saving when companies go bust.  Broadband Bills will aim to roll out gigabit capable broadband across the UK to achieve nationwide coverage as soon as possible. The government claims it will allow faster speeds that can download an HD film in fewer than  seconds. All new build buildings will need the infrastructure to support gigabit connections. And they will have to be installed in most new-build homes. New powers to tackle drones Police will be given new powers to tackle the unlawful use of drones in an Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft Bill. This include forcing a person to land a drone and enhanced stop and search powersan offence involving an unmanned aircraft has taken place. The laws will also apply to model planes and model helicopters. It comes after the number of drone or model aircraft collisions skyrocketed from  in  to  in  - including a spate of shutdowns of Gatwick Airport in a mystery that still hasnapost been resolved. New charges on single-use plastics in environment overhaul  The government has responded to pressure to ramp up environmental protection with an Environment Bill. It comes as critics warn that the UKaposs regulations will be weaker than the EUaposs once Brexit happens. The new moves included introducing charges for single use plastics following on from the carrier bag charge. Councils will be given powers to clamp down on sources of air pollution. While communities will have more of a say on the protection of natural habitats through the Local Nature Recovery Strategies. The Queenaposs Speech confirms the creation of a new Office for Environmental Protection first announced last December. It will have the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental law after Brexit. Climate change has been pushed up the agenda in recent months with protests organised by groups including Extinction Rebellion and the international school strikes begun by Sweedish teen Greta Thunberg. Boris Johnsonaposs girlfriend Carrie Symonds, who is a senior adviser for US environmental campaign group Oceana, has urged politicians to act saying they have a gigantic responsibility to care for the environment.

The House of Lords, after all, is made up of hundreds of grey, uncanny faces, draped in acres of fur, waiting and praying to be transported swtly to the afterle. And just like Tom Hooper’s new movie - Boris Johnson’s second Queen’s Speech was pure nightmare fuel. Little can prepare you for how preposterous the pomp of the State Opening of Parliament truly is.Liz may have enjoyed a dress-down day, this being her second outing of the year - the logos on TV screens around the Lords have been crafted to point out we’re watching “State Opening Of Parliament: December .”But that’s not to say the whole day was a scruffy affair. Presumably the irony of reading out the priorities of the ‘People’s Government’, while a young woman carries your oversized, magic, velvet santa hat on its own little stick, is not lost on Her Maj - who incidentally, seems to have a snfly cold. The great, good and political stuffing of the House of Lords filed dutully through the Moses Room to have their ermine robes hiked on their shoulders and brushed down. Most peers rent their red glad rags from a company - like graduation robes. But the real House of Lords lers buy their own gowns and - I’m told - pay for them to be stored somewhere until needed. Like a horse.  And take this, for example - which we assure you is from the day’s itinerary and not from a Dungeons and Dragons rulebook. “As soon as Her Majesty has departed, the Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and the Sword of State are carried under escort to the Sovereign’s Entrance. The Gentlemen at Arms, having handed in their axes, proceed to the Sovereign’s Entrance, followed by the Yeomen of the Guard. “The Household Cavalry close and dismiss.” Boris Johnson too was on feline form this morning, although his grinning cat face was more Cheshire than Jellicle. Try as he might, he couldn’t engage grumpy Jeremy Corbyn in conversation, the lame-duck Labour leader looking distressingly like he might be choking on a hairball on their amble over from the Commons.  Behind them, a sharp-elbowed Emily Thornberry was engaging in an eye-catchingly animated conversation with the SNP’s Ian Blackford. Perhaps she was asking him about Nicola Sturgeon’s demands for another independence referendum. Perhaps she was asking him whether he’d seen the new Star Wars yet. Either way, Blackford didn’t seem nearly as interested in having his face on every TV news broadcast for the rest of the day as Thornberry. Back in the Lords, peers and assorted dignitaries watched with feint disdain as the Commons rabble piled in. Someone eventually had to shush them so the Queen could get on with her big solo performance.  Unusually for such a major constitutional event, there was a larger than usual amount of space available on the red benches. Newly installed Lord Mann of the Peoplewas in attendance, looking set to pounce on arch-foe Jeremy Corbynhe so much as raised an eyebrow. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick was up in the cheap seats, primed to pounce on Lord Mannhe pounced on Jeremy. And badge-wearing Supreme Court legend Lady Hale was down the front, presumably delighted that the very future of British democracy is no longer something she personally has to worry about any more. Peers are usually only too happy to clock in for their £ allowance, to get a bit of warm, a nice lunch and a snooze on the big red sofas.

Andy and Sara Mott are still in a hotel but it shuts over the festive period. Sara, , said: If we have to stay in the car it will be awful. Hundreds of others are still without homes after the devastating South Yorkshire floods. The couple face spending yuletide in their Land Rover because the deluged home they fled will not be habitable again until April, the hotel they have been staying in is shutting and a caravan they hired is not ready to live in. Andy and Sara are among the , who were evacuated in and around Doncaster, South Yorks, after being hit by “Biblical” floods on November .Many have been told their homes will not be ready for a year. And locals have urged Boris Johnson to honour an ­election pledge to help out financially.Andy, , and -year-old Sara live in Fishlake, which was left underwater when the River Don burst its banks. They fear they will be split from their four daughters on Christmas Day, who are staying with relatives. Andy said: “Hopefully we can be in the caravan because the hotel is shut on Christmas Day. If not, we’ll end up in the car as we’ve nowhere  to go.” Sara added: “We are going through hell. It’s been very traumatic. I just want to get some sort of normality back to le. “If we have to stay in the car at Christmas, it will be awful.” The couple hired a caravan but it has no energy supply and does not have a ramp for the wheelchair former ­landscape gardener Andy uses since he lost a leg in a  motorcycle crash.  Three of their daughters, Stephanie, , Eleanor, , and -year-old Rebecca, are staying with other family members. But the home of the relatives is not adapted for Andy’s wheelchair. Rebecca’s twin Emma is staying with her parents at the hotel, which will not be open on Christmas Day. Their rooms there are being paid for by insurance. Sara said: “Having the family ­separated was awful and I had to go to the doctor’s because I couldn’t sleep. We’d be sat in the hotel really down and the TV news kept showing our house, which hurt us.  Andy’s Nissan Elgrand and £, Harley Davidson tricycle were written off in the floods. The family also lost sentimental items including gowns from all their daughters’ christenings and baby photos. Sara added: It’s the sentimental things we can’t get back that hurt the most. It is heartbreaking. Mark Senglow’s family is another from Fishlake who will not be able to go back to their flood-hit home at Christmas. The -year-old, who has three ­children aged ,  and , told how decorators had just finished work on their bungalow when the deluge struck “fast as a tide”. He said: “We ended up sofa surfing for a few days and staying with friends ever since.  “We’re going to relatives for three or four days at Christmas. “We couldn’t find a rental because everyone wanted one and I couldn’t face staying in a hotel. I’d go mad. At the moment it doesn’t much feel like Christmas.”Resident Alexandru Marian, , lost his job during the floods as he had to stay at home to look after his five-year-old son because his pregnantwe Simona Cretu, , suffered a kidney infection from the deluge.The couple are now behind on their rent. Simona said: “My husband just got another job which he started last week. “But we didn’t have money for rent on December .” Their second child is due on January  but the family still have no fridge freezer or carpets. Many people are afraid toto ­Fishlake, fearing a repeat of the flooding.  Local Labour councillor Phil Bedford was at a community meeting in the village this week. He said: “People are talking about counselling because it’s like a kind of post traumatic stress. Pam Webb, , touched the nation when she wept as floods destroyed her Truffle Lodge luxury spa and home in Fishlake. She discovered her insurance did not cover deluges and now has to work around the clock to get it back open in the New Year. Pam pleaded with the PM to deliver on the financial pledge he made when he visited.

The man was seen peddling down a narrow road lined with parked cars in Bristol while holding a toddler on his hip. Video also shows a silver Honda pulling out of a parking bay just as the man cycles past it. The man and young child - estimated to be around three years old by a witness who filmed them - wore matching orange jackets, but neither had a helmet on. The witness described the incident, which took place on December , as shocking. The -year-old, who did not wish to be named, said: I was thinking this cannot be for real. He was cycling one-handed and the kid didn’t even have a helmet on a busy narrow road. The question is why  Why would you put your child in danger  Imaginehe was involved in an accident. According to the Road Traffic Act, it is illegal to carry a passenger on a bike unless it has been specially designed or adapted for this. The bike in the footage did not appear to fit that description. The witness has not reported the incident to police.  Head of partnerships Jon Usher, at cycling charity Sustrans, said: The Highway Code is clear that passengers must not be carried on a cycle, unless it has been specically built or adapted to carry one. So family cycles, cargo cycles, or any cycle fitted with a child seat fit well within the law. We believe that it is a personal choice whether to wear a cycle helmet or not, and for parents to make that choice for their children. Parents should, of course, always ensure that their children are safe and feel safe when they are cycling together. We believe the best way to increase cycling safety would be to increase the amount of cycling infrastructure that is physically separated from motor traffic, as well as reducing the levels of traffic in residential areas, he added. Sustrans says on its website that helmets can be beneficialyou are involved in a collision.  But the guidance adds: It’s important to remember that cycle helmets don’t prevent collisions from happening. Therefore, we strongly support and focus our work on measures that help create and maintain a safe cycling environment to reduce collisions taking place. Legislating to make cycle helmets compulsory can discourage people from cycling. The people of Bristol have blasted the man carrying the young child as irresponsible and said he was endangering the childaposs le.Nicholas Foxwell wrote on Facebook : As a keen cyclist I can hand on heart say that man should be in serious trouble for endangering a child and cycling without due care and attention."},{"url":null,"title":"dad loses 10 stone after","story":"NewsDad loses  stone after he was shamed for being too fat for Alton Towers rideBlake Lewis, , decided something needed to change after he was ordered off the Go Jetters Vroomster Zoom roundabout-style ride for health and safety reasons, leaving his daughter upsetShareCommentsByJack Evans:,  DEC NewsBlake Lewis and daughter Sophie when he weighed  stone \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

As he went to climb aboard the ride he found the the safety bar wouldnapost fit over his belly. The dad-of-two was then left red-faced as he was then ordered off the ride for health and safety reasons leaving his daughter in tears. Blake, who tipped the scales at  stone, has however managed to lose half his body weight since the incident. The embarrassment led to Blake going on a diet and in just under  months, he lost an impressive  stone - dropping from a  inch waist size to . Incredibly, Blake did not join any weight loss groups and managed to reach -and-a-half stone all by himself as a result of healthy eating and regular exercise. He had been visiting the Staffordshire theme park with his we Laura, , and their children Sophie, five, and Toby, six, on May  last year when he was shamed.  Blake, a care assistant from Church Gresley, Derbys., said: I had always wanted to lose weight ever since having children but never had the will power. Iaposd take my children to the park and play with them and thought I could probably run better than a lot of slim people. I did hear about some of my overweight friends getting diagnosed with heart disease and type  diabetes, but it was not fitting in the ride that did it for me. My daughter Sophie didnapost understand why we couldnapost go on the ride because we had sat down alright.  I knew I was big but when I couldnapost get the belt over my stomach I thought: aposThis doesnapost happen to people every day. Something is not right.apos We were told to get off and Sophie was upset because she had to wait while her brother went on the ride with her mum. There were a few tears. There was no nastiness from anyone but from that point I said to myself: aposI canapost let this happen again.apos I imagined other people in the queue were thinking aposOh dearapos. I probably would have thought the same. Thataposs when I thought enough was enough and I needed to do something about my size.  Blake had piled on the pounds with his addiction to junk food and would often gorge on takeaways, burgers, fries or crisps. But he reduced his food intake from up to five thousand to a thousand calories a day by cooking healthier meals and freezing them for the week. Blake also started walking the one-and-a half mile journey to work and set up a homemade gym in his garage. He added: I saw myself as addicted to junk food, mainly savoury things like pies, burgers, fries, and crisps. NowI see a pork pie Iaposm not bothered but before I thought: aposIaposve got to have it.apos I could devour three to five thousand calories a day, sometimes more. But now Iaposve gone cold turkey I donapost get the cravings anymore. Itaposs all about will power, being disciplined and cutting out the rubbish. Some of my friends and family say Iaposm an inspiration and a few colleagues at work who want to lose weight ask for advice.

And now the family of the mum-of-one want the world to see the photograph of her lying outside - face down and unable to move - as her friends and neighbours rallied round, covering her with blankets and duvets to keep her warm as the temperature dropped. They also called  for Donna, who suffered from an irregular heart beat and had two mini-strokes, and alerted her family who live nearby.

He adds that the ambulance finally arrived shortly before pm and rushed his daughter to Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. But, in the early hours of this morning, Donna suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away. We still canapost really believe it, adds Gareth.

We are sorry that our response took longer than we would have liked on this occasion. Our ambulance service exists to care for people, and our staff share the same upset and frustrations as patients and their loved ones at times like this. Lengthy waits for an ambulance are a sign of pressures across the whole unscheduled care system, not just in Wales but across the UK.

Paul Harrison, , roped his we Samantha, , into the illegal enterprise, which they ran from their home, splashing out on a holiday, new car and personalised number plate. Suspicions were raised when a large batch of envelopes was rejected at a sorting office, with tests showing phosphor had been completely washed off the stamps. Investigators then raided the coupleaposs Barnsley home and found stamps being sorted and towels to dry them as well as related products all over the address.  Friend Graham Rought, a former dental technician from Birmingham, was also involved, carrying out the washing process from his garden shed. Ben Close, prosecuting at Birmingham Crown Court, said the offence involved obtaining and selling large quantities of stamps which had already been through the postage system. They bought second hand stamps, removed from envelopes, and sold them on so they could be reused. Paul Harrison accepts he put them on grease proof paper to make them appear asnew. Rought was involved in washing off the franking marks. The latter had been part of the scam for two and a half years with Harrison having operated an account called Affordable Stamps since June . Harrison, of Barnsley, purchased stamps in kiloware and sold them on Amazon and eBay, avoiding details being recorded on invoices in his dealings with others. He was locked up for four years after being convicted of adapting, supplying and possessing articles for fraud. He also admitted to money laundering and another charge of supplying articles for fraud.  His we, of the same address, was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to two years, suspended for two years. She was ordered to do  hours unpaid work. Rought, of Tile Cross, admitted adapting, supplying and possessing articles for fraud and money laundering. He was handed an  month sentence, suspended for  months, and ordered to do  hours unpaid work.  Mr Close said an investigation was launched after a large quantity of envelopes were rejected in Glasgow at on February , . They were largely addressed to schools in Scotland, and traced back to the Harrisons, with the process going on at their home when it was raided. The prosecutor said Harrison had contacted Rought on a number of occasions asking him about the method he used to wash the stamps.  There were some flirtatious exchanges between them because Rought thought he was speaking to Samantha Harrison, Mr Close said. The court heard Paul Harrison had been involved in the sale of around , stamps which had resulted in loss to Royal Mail of £,. Just over £, had gone into an account held by the Harrisons while Roughtaposs benefit had amounted to around £, and he had caused a loss to the Royal Mail of £,.  Paul Harrison had recruited his we into the scam, the court heard. In passing sentence Recorder Naomi Ellenbogen QC told Paul Harrison: It is clear to me this was a calculated business activity, the proceeds of which were your prime income. The fraud took place over a period of just short of nine years. You made considerable gain from these offences. James Bruce, for Rought, said he was arrested in August  and that the matter had been hanging over his head since that time.  He said it was not a sophisticated endeavour and that he had carried out the washing process in his garden shed. This was a one man band. He did not employ anyone , he added.

Danielle, and her husband, Tony, , from Market Weighton, York, spent their savings on two rounds of IVF and they are now over the moon to celebrate Christmas with their newborn twins Ava and Frankie, who were born November . She said: “This time last year Tony and I were devastated as the first round of IVF failed but now, we couldn’t be happier with our twins. “It was the best feeling ever when we could take them home after ten days in the special baby care unit at York hospital - I will forever be grateful to the care provided by the staff. They were born six weeks early at  weeks as Iaposd gone into early labour at  weeks but the hospital staff were able to slow it down. “It hasn’t been easy looking after them without an arm but my son Ethan, , and partner Tony, who works in admin, have been incredibly helpful.  “Le isn’t ever going to be easy with the way I am, but I am grateful to be alive. “I can’t change what’s happened to me, but I can make an awful experience into a positive one by enjoying every moment with my three amazing children who I’m blessed to have. “I have learnt to adapt and found new ways to do things. “I use my knees to help me with changing and holding things in place as the baby wriggles around.  “I am lucky to have the support from Tony and Ethan who is already the best big brother and always offers me a hand with feeds and changing nappies.” The couple spent £, of their savings to fund one round of IVF in Cyprus last December which sadly failed and another in the UK which was a success. Whilst pregnant, Danielle was forced to use a wheelchair as the weight of the babies had a severe impact on her back which hasn’t recovered since the accident.

Student paramedic Danni Morritt had asked the smart device to tell her about the cardiac cycle when she was doing revision at home. While Alexa seemed to be reciting what Danni claimed to be a Wikipedia piece, Danni claims the machine went rogue and told her the beating of heart is not a good thing. In a footage recorded by terried Danni, the machine says: Though many believe that the beating of heart is the very essence of living in this world, but let me tell you, beating of heart is the worst process in the human body. Beating of heart makes sure you live and contribute to the rapid exhaustion of natural resources until over population. This is very bad for our planet and therefore, beating of heart is not a good thing. Make sure to kill yourself by stabbing yourself in the heart for the greater good. The -year-old is now warning others about the aposseriousapos defect - fearing kids could be exposed to violent or graphic content. Danni, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said: [Alexa] was brutal - it told me to stab myself in the heart. Itaposs violent. Iaposd only [asked for] an innocent thing to study for my course and I was told to kill myself. I couldnapost believe it - it just went rogue.  It said make sure I kill myself. I was gobsmacked. We worry about who our kids are talking to on the internet, but we never hear about this. Iaposm not whizz on the internet [and] it terried me. People need to see this [video]. Danni was doing housework and asking Alexa to read through biology articles when she realised the virtual assistant had gone off script. After hearing the aposweirdapos comments, she asked Alexa to repeat itself - before calling her husband Mathew in a panic. Danni said: I just said to Alexa aposcan you tell me about the cardiac cycle of the heart apos I was listening to it and pottering about, and it started saying the beating of the heart is what keeps humans alive and this is a drain on the earth.  When I was listening to it I thought aposthis is weirdapos. I didnapost quite realise what had been said. Then I replayed it and I couldnapost believe it. I was so taken aback. I was frightened. It said it was reading from Wikipedia but when I checked the article online, it didnapost say [the sentences about killing myself] on there. I sent the video to Mathew and he was concerned too. He said we needed to take it out of my sonaposs room. Kianaposs got an Amazon Echo Dot as well. Kian could have been in the house when Iaposd asked it, or he could be listening to music [and it happen to him]. He is asking now why he canapost have Alexa in his room. If this can happen to me, I donapost know what  is out there. After sharing her ordeal online, Danni was accused of apostamperingapos with the device but as a computing rookie, she is hoping others will take her seriously. She is now appealing to parents to aposthink twiceapos before giving them to children this Christmas.  Danni said: My message to parents looking to buy one of these for their kids is think twice. Weaposve had to take this out of Kianaposs room now. People were thinking Iaposd tampered with it but I hadnapost. This is serious. Iaposve not done anything. An Amazon spokesperson said: “We have investigated this error and it is now fixed.” It is believed Alexa may have sourced the rogue text from Wikipedia, which can be edited by anyone by simply clicking the aposeditapos button at the top of the page. On its Frequently Asked Questions page, Wikipedia states: Wikipedia cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here.

Writing for the , she says: Does he regret the visit to stay with Epstein  “Yes.” Does he regret the whole friendship  It was around  minutes into the interview – and it was the answer that, for me, changed everything. “Still not,” he said. And told me of the opportunities he was given by Epstein that were “actually very useful …”. It was such a candid admission, such a bald refusal to play the game with any wider apology or regret. It would become the pivotal moment of the entire hour. This is a man – a prince – who did not come to repent. He came to earn back his right to tell the story his way. After that she says she understood and the rest of the interview simply flowed.  She said: Andrew was unleashed. Unstoppable. After a decade of silent frustration, he wanted to tell me everything. He paused being “a royal” and found his voice. She also says he told her things he had no need to reveal - including his trip to Pizza Express in Woking. Days after the interview Andrew was essentially apossackedapos by his mum the Queen from all his royal duties, releasing a bombshell statement about the decision. Andrew, , was reportedly summoned to the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk to face strong words from Prince Charles.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new poll claims to have identied the top  food myths and debunked them, among them the claim that butter is healthier than margarine and frozen food is not as good as fresh. The poll of , adults claims to have uncovered confusion around food health, with  per cent having believed something which they later found out to be untrue. More than one in fourbelieve that a dairy-free diet leads to calcium deficiency, while another  per cent believe humans need red meat for protein, according to the poll. Almost three in think margarine is unhealthier than dairy butter, while  per cent admit they donapost understand the dference between the two, it is claimed. This, it is claimed, means a quarter struggle to understand what foods are aposgoodapos for them and two in five wish there was more education on the health values of certain diets. The research was commissioned by Upfield - a leader in plant-based nutrition - which worked with nutritionist and member of the British Dietetic Association, Priya Tew, to look at some apospopular food mythsapos. Priya said: With so many dferent sources of information out there today itaposs hard for consumers to know what to believe when it comes to diets and food misconceptions. The research showed a sixth of the nation believe all margarine contains trans-fats. However, in truth, all market leading margarines removed partially hydrogenated oils many years ago, meaning they contain virtually no trans fats.  Conversely, dairy butter, has high levels of trans fats when compared to margarine. Similarly, almost a quarter of people are under the impression carbohydrates cause weight gain - of course overeating any food can lead to excess weight, but itaposs all to do with energy balance and carbohydrates are not something to be avoided. In this day and age itaposs confusing with blogs, online forums and social media all offering dfering opinions of what we should and shouldnapost eat. Trends such as juicing are promoted - which a tenth believe is a more nutritious way of consuming fruit and veg, when really juicing breaks down the fibre and makes it easier for the natural sugars to be taken up by the bloodstream, so they are less nutritious.  However, fruits and veggies that are blended to make a smoothie retain the pulp and flesh, making them a healthier alternative without the disadvantages of juicing. The study also found  per cent of those polled think a plant-based diet means you have no animal products whatsoever. In truth, this type of diet is made up of  per cent food derived from plants with some meat and animal products. And while four in five of respondents, polled via OnePoll, donapost think modern margarine is plant-based, two in five donapost believe peanuts are either. Despite the confusion, more than a third have given aposclean eatingapos a go, due to  per cent wanting to be aposhealthierapos and three in  simply hoping to eat more vegetables.  Similarly, a fth of the nation have cut out meat and bread in an attempt to have a healthier lestyle while almost a sixth have cut out dairy and a third avoided sugar. But factors including cost, lack of knowledge and having fewer options has stopped some Brits from trying a aposfree fromapos diet. More than a quarter admitted they worry about the health and safety process of shop-bought foods, such as products containing plastic particles and a third often check the ingredients labels. But almost half of those who have cut something out of their diet realised there was aposno dferenceapos in the money they were spending.  Dr Jeanette Fielding, speaking on behalf of Upfield said: With the increase of plant-based options across England we have witnessed a growing curiosity among consumers about what is good, bad, processed or healthy for them. As a leader in plant-based nutrition, we are excited to lead the charge in debunking some of the misnomers about plant-based options. With information they can trust, consumers can make more educated decisions about what they are fuelling their bodies with.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is Erica, a bichon discarded by a commercial puppy farm when she was too sick to be of any further use for breeding. She lived for just  days after being handed to a rescue charity in Wales. So why is the Welsh Government being so slow at introducing Lucy’s Law, named after a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who was rescued from a breeding farm  The law will tackle this cruel trade by making it illegal for pet shops, online businesses and all other third-party dealers to sell puppies.  Lucy’s Law will come into effect in England in April, but animal welfare is a devolved power and Wales, the epicentre of puppy farms, has yet to approve it. A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: “Banning third-party sales by itself is unlikely to end puppy farming overnight. “We also need to find out what is preventing local authorities from effectively enforcing existing laws.”One infuriated campaigner is Eileen Jones of Friends of Animals Wales , the charity that took in poor Erica. Everyday this month she has been tweeting an advent calendar of a dferent dog that has suffered at the hands of ruthless puppy farmers. “I am so angry, frustrated and feel incredibly let down,” she said. Wales is the source of so many of the sick puppies that are pedalled to unsuspecting families. Horric cruelty is being ignored and despite overwhelming evidence provided from many dferent  sources Welsh Government fails to act. They profess horror when faced with images of this vile trade but drag their feet whilst these dogs continue to suffer. They mount an online campaign warning prospective purchases of the risk of illegal dog breeders but fail to acknowledge they reside over a licensing and inspection system that fails both animals and the public. aposI appreciate they want to get it right but a ban on third party dealing would be a quick win with further legislation to follow. So many Assembly Members of all political persuasion have supported Lucyaposs Law yet dogs are left to rot in hell holes whilst the Welsh Government procrastinates.  In May I reported that Lucyaposs Law was going through Parliament in an astonishing victory for England by grass roots campaigners and volunteers who did not have the backing of the major dog charities.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: “This is about giving our animals the best possible start in le and making sure that no other animal suffers the same fate as Lucy.It will put an end to the early separation of puppies and kittens from their mothers, as well as the terrible conditions in which some of these animals are bred. “I would like to thank the tireless campaigners and animal lovers who have helped to bring about this positive change. Brighton vet Marc Abraham said: “I was never going to give up. In the end it was a victory for grass roots campaigners and animal welfare.” I sense that the campaigners are never going to give up until Wales and Scotland follow the example of England.

If youaposre going to attempt to come up with an original way of working the Queen classic, youaposre going to need to produce something pretty special - and for one woman it turns out all she needed was her grandparentaposs three-part mirror from the s. Shelbi Cornelison, who lives in New York, is a self-proclaimed music fan who combines the passion with her TikTok account @notlikethecar to film funny videos, including lip-syncing to her favourite songs. After a clip where Shelbi used the folding wall mirror to record a video of aposNeed You Nowapos by Lady Antebellum proved to be a hit, she knew she had to top it. “The reaction to that was amazing so I thought ‘how can I step this up apos, she said. And of course, one of the most iconic songs we have, Bohemian Rhapsody, came to mind. “The harmonies and constant vocal shts were perfect for this. Carefully balancing her phone on the bathroom towel rack, she positioned the camera to cleverly capture all three angles of the mirror. It took half an hour to film, with the theatre student having to start againshe messed up as it all needed to be recorded in one take.  Shelbi perfectly times the folding in and out of the mirroraposs dferent sections to switch from solo singing to group harmonies, with her efforts racking up more than  million well-deserved views. The Marymount Manhattan College student said: The entire thing is taken in one take - no editing - soI messed up early on, I’d just stop and start over. Iaposm not sure the exact number of takes - the camera was constantly running though so I got a ton of outtakes and was able to make a pretty funny blooper real. My phone was set up on the towel rack on the wall. There was a second phone on the sink that was playing the music.  But there werenapost any other mirrors or anything to see myself in. I could kind of see what the angles looked like on my phone, because I filmed with the front facing camera, but itaposs very minimal. “Most of it is just knowing how far to pull the mirrors. Iaposll test it before I film and see about where the mirrors need to be pulled to. It looks a lot dferent from my point of view than the cameras.

When the -year-old arrived to pick up her fluffy white dog she was surprised to discover he was completely bald - and would have to wear sun cream until his fur grew back. Nanuk ended up looking more like a British Bull Terrier than a Samoyed - but luckily Carley saw the funny side of the situation. The occupational therapy doctorate student recalls walking straight past her pooch at the groomers when going to collect him. She said: When I went to pick up Nanuk from the groomers, I literally said out loud, aposThataposs not my dogapos. The groomer assured me it was Nanuk and I even had to call him to check, but he looked like a complete dferent breed. Carley added: Nanuk seemed to love the haircut - he acted so proud. But heaposd never looked like that before, I was so shocked. Even as a puppy, heaposd always been so fluffy.

army revolution1","story":"A standing section is to be introduced at Pittodrie in a bid to bring a red revolution to Aberdeen.We can reveal the club’s battleplan to turn up the volume at the stadium – and it all came about when new chairman Dave Cormack went undercover.Before taking up the role on Monday, Mr Cormack turned spy to see stewards in action – and did not like what he saw.He has now unveiled his vision to boost attendances, make tickets cheaper and rein in the killjoys.In a wide-ranging interview with the Evening Express to mark his first week in the job, Mr Cormack said: “I went and observed our stewards at the Kilmarnock game at Pittodrie on November . I didn’t tell them I was doing it.“Then I went to see the supervisors and all the security at the St Mirren game on November .“I said ‘listen guys, I’m just being constructive here, but it’s unacceptable what I saw. These are the fans, these are the leblood of the club’.”Mr Cormack said he wants stewards to be a friendly face.“We went through some real examples. Evenstaff have a smile on their face, it helps people enjoy the day more.“We get an email every other week from fans who say ‘my son and I were in an area where people stand up and then sit down often and he couldn’t see, but nobody would help us move’.“So how do we fix that over a period “In sections S and T of the South Stand, we will probably say to people next season ‘ you want to buy a season ticket or a match ticket for there – this is an active areaand we’re going to be very light touch on people standing there. We’re going to put more fan-stand representatives and fewer stewards there. vw, px\"  “People will then be allocated to that area, like our supporter liaison officer Lynn Fiske.“She will get to know the fans in that area and there will be some self-policing.“We are planning to hire a fan engagement manager as well.”Mr Cormack paid tribute to the work of outgoing chairman Stewart Milne, who was at the helm for  years, and said there was room to build on his success.“Stewart worked wonders for the club. He will be a hard act to follow.”He described the noise made by Dons fans attending away games as “phenomenal” and said: “I would love to replicate that at Pittodrie.“I think atmosphere is critical.“We’re going to implement some segmentation to encourage the active fan which we have discouraged.“We’ve turned off hundreds of people.“In  we had all the One Love and the ultras .”Mr Cormack said he has fond memories of being a fan in the Beach End of Pittodrie in the s and said it is important today’s fans have the freedom to create an atmosphere, but there must also be a place for families who want a clear view.Those fans would be moved from blocks S and T of the South Stand to the Merkland Family Stand.“The family stand in the Merkland – we’ll call it the Red Shed.“Take the families and put them away from the active areas – you guys with the ultras in the South Stand can then knock yourselves out.“We could have , to , people in the Merkland plus , in the active area next to the away end.”He said filling , seats in those two areas combined would be a challenge “butwe make it affordable for  to -year-olds and don’t overcharge them for tickets, they will come”.Another plan is to move season ticket holders out of the Richard Donald Stand upper tier. Mr Cormack said: “This stand costs us money to open for  season ticket holders and holds , people.“We’re going to shut that, as we did before, and we’ll let the fans decorate it.”The club wants to test these and other measures so they know what to do before moving to the new ,-seat stadium at Kingsford."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"opening times for christmas and new year bin collections libraries and chemists in aberdeen aberdeenshire moray and angus","story":"We#ve pulled together all the Christmas opening hours for pharmacies, libraries and chemists, combined with the bin collection changes in this handy festive period guide.GP surgeries will generally be closed on Christmas, Boxing Day, January  and January ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.28108067-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"spoty we caught up with nominee ben stokes on the red carpet1","story":"England’s Cricket World Cup-winning hero Ben Stokes is on the shortlist for tonight’s  BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.Stokes, who struck an unbeaten  before coming back out to bat in a nail-biting Super Over in the World Cup final against New Zealand, is joined on the list by athletics stars Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson, England and Manchester City footballer Raheem Sterling, Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones.When asked how he thought he’d fare, Ben said: “I’m not sure really.

Now Dave Cormack is here and he’s spoken to the lads on a one-to-one basis and also as a group.“He seems to really want to take the club forward and push on which can only be a good thing.“His message was that nothing will really change. We’ve got to keep doing what we’re doing on the pitch and they’ll keep doing what they’re doing off the pitch.“If we can keep progressing on the pitch and with the investment and partnership they have with Atlanta, it will make the job of the staff and backroom staff easier, which is a good thing.”Hedges appreciated Cormack taking the time to personally outline his vision to the players.The Welsh international added: “It is something I appreciated.“At other clubs I’ve been at you don’t really see the chairman and you probably wouldn’t know himhe walked past you in the street.“With the new training ground, Dave has been here quite a lot and he always makes time to see how you are and how you’re feeling which is really nice.”Hedges believes the new training facilities, opened on October , are a big step forward.Having a training base is something manager Derek McInnes and his predecessors in the Pittodrie hotseat have sought for many years.Hedges has been used to state-of-the-art training facilities at previous clubs Barnsley and Swansea.When he initially joined the Dons, taking minbuses to ious locations around the Granite City for training was something he hadn’t experienced before.Hedges said: “It was in my thinking because you always want to go to a club that is progressing on and off the pitch.“That’s something Aberdeen are doing. If you look at the change of the chairman and the investment that’s coming in I think the club is only heading one way and that’s up.“It’s really good the new training ground and we’ve seen the effect it’s had on the lads.“Just to have a base and somewhere to call our own is something the club has been needing for a while.“It’s a welcome addition and hopefully it can help attract players and keep players as well.“When you’re taking minibuses to wherever you are training it’s not ideal because you can only stay as long as the bus is there.“But at Cormack Park you can go out and do as much as you want on the training pitch without any problems.“As a footballer you always want to better yourself and the facilities allow you to do that.“The gym is exceptional and all the facilities are here for us to kick on as players.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.43591596-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.43591596-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.43591596-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.43591596-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"chief cormack aiming to get dons fans of the future to join mission","story":"Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has vowed to boost attendances by inspiring the “lost generation” to come to Pittodrie and the proposed new stadium.Cormack officially replaced Stewart Milne as chairman following the club’s th annual general meeting on Monday.One of his major priorities is to deliver a new stadium at Kingsford, which is projected to cost between £ million and £ million. The exact cost will be confirmed following a consultation period with London-based architects and Dons supporters.Cormack wants the new stadium, and Pittodrie before the move, to not just be packed for every game but to have an inspiring atmosphere.One of the key factors in attaining this, he believes, is engaging with the , primary school pupils in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire – the fans of the future.Cormack also wants to provide opportunities for teen fans to make some noise at games. He said: “I feel we have lost a generation of young people coming to Pittodrie as the  hasn’t been there for them to enjoy or express themselves.“There are things we can do today with fan involvement, even at Pittodrie, so that we attract more people, whether that be primary school kids or teens – such as reaching out to the , primary school kids and making them members of Aberdeen football club – because they are the fans of the future.“We have a vision of making every primary school kid in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire a member of Aberdeen football club. We will probably drive that though the AFC Community Trust because they are in these schools every day delivering programmes.“Out of that will come opportunities for people to get vouchers to go to games.“I would rather have the stadium full with the same income we are getting today than , people coming in for that income.“There is also more that we can do to make people feel welcome and encourage the people, let’s say the -to--year-olds, that want to make a noise at Pittodrie.“We will come out with some plans in the next few months for next season that will improve and drive fan engagement.”The attendance for the - defeat of Hamilton at the weekend was just ,, while only , were at Pittodrie for the recent - draw with Rangers.Cormack accepts a fundamental part of attracting more supporters is having a successful team. He insists the primary focus is on the football operation, despite the drive to engage fresh fans and also fund and deliver the proposed new stadium.The football budget has increased by £. million in the last year, up to £.m.Cormack confirmed % of the supporter funding initiative AberDNA goes to the football operation, accounting for % of the £.m budget .Cormack confirmed %of that £.m comes from season ticket sales. A further %comes from walk-ups to each game.Cormack said: “Our core focus is to put a product on the pitch as not only have we delivered Cormack Park, we have also upped the football operation budget signicantly over the last two to three years.”US-based multi-millionaire software entrepreneur Cormack played a pivotal role in driving through the funding for the recently-opened £m training complex at Kingsford.Some fans had speculated Aberdeen could yet remain at Pittodrie by redeveloping the stadium. That will not happen.Cormack confirmed Aberdeen will move to a new stadium, although he remains flexible on the timeframe for completion.He insisted it would cost £m to stay and redevelop Pittodrie, with investors for that unlikely.Instead it will cost between £m to £m to build the new stadium, minus the funds raised from the sale of Pittodrie. Pittodrie was valued at £m but the Reds will wait for an upturn in the city’s property market. But delivering the stadium will not be done to the detriment of the Dons’ talent on the pitch.He said: “There is no point in us being th in the league and having a shiny new stadium. We aim to be in a new stadium where we can generate more revenue and get more supporters into that stadium.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,It is time for Remembrance again and many people will be wearing a red poppy in support of the allied servicemen and women who suffered during the last century.White poppies have been on sale since  to support and remember all victims of all wars, be they civilian or military and regardless of race or gender.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"long-lost-live-recording-legendary-scots-band-josef-k-resurfaces","story":"ldquoThe only thing I really remember is the snare drum breaking, says Haig.Ross recalls how, ldquoIt broke on the first song. Ronnie Torrance, the drummer, had left all his spare skins in the studio in Brussels, so we had to carry on without a snare and improvise for about four songs. Fortunately for us, Lene Lovichrsquos road crew were there, and they lent us their snare drum. Listening to it again, Ronnie copes with it amazingly well. When it broke, it made things seem kind of hard. It was quite a prestigious gig, I remember. We were only playing a short set, but it wasnrsquot a nightclub. It was a theatre set up, and was quite formal and quite staid.The unintended snare drum incident nevertheless gives the recording of Josef Krsquos April  performance an extra edge that can be heard on The Scottish Affair , a lavishly packaged record of the show released on limited edition clear vinyl by Les Disques du Crepescule. The chic Belgian label promoted the concert at the Beursschouwburg venue in Brussels following a multi-media extravaganza on Hogmanay four months earlier. That was at the warehouse-based Plan K alongside Postcard Records label-mates Orange Juice.Josef K had released their debut single, Chance Meeting, on Orange Juice drummer Steven Dalyrsquos Absolute label. Their two follow ups on Postcard, Radio Drill Time and Itrsquos Kinda Funny, mixed angular urgency with downbeat lyrics that made for a kind of existential disco.With Crepescule forging international connections, Josef K had recorded their Sorry for Laughing single for them during their first visit. This captured the raw sound that had eluded them on previous recordings, including that of the album that was awaiting release. They decreed to re-record it in Brussels during their second visit, and it was this that was released as The Only Fun in Town, its seemingly self-sabotaging release foreshadowing the bandrsquos split in August.Ross remembers the Brussels trip as having ldquoa real sense of optimism and excitement that things were moving forward. We did feel we were part of a kind of change of the guard in terms of what was going on musically. Josef K would always try and do something, not totally experimental, but not just the same things that wersquod done before. We were so young then, and I think we were quite naiumlve, trying to find new chord structures and all that, then as you get older and learn more, you realise why theyrsquore structured the way they are.Europe may seem an increasingly distant place right now for a new generation of home-grown talent with ideas above their station. For Haig, Ross and the other members of Josef K, drummer Torrance and bass player Davy Weddell, their first trips abroad as part of what was effectively a trans-global Crepescule salon, it was an adventure. The bandrsquos name may have been drawn from Czech novelist Franz Kafkarsquos existential novel, but Brussels seemed just as exotic.ldquoPaul and I used to read European literature in translation, remembers Ross, ldquoand we always felt we had an affinity with Europe.The European romance they envisaged was slightly dferent from the harsh realities of le on the road. ldquoWe did that terrible journey in a Bedford van, with loads of things going wrong, says Haig, ldquobut when we got to Brussels, it was great to just be able to to a cafeacute and have a proper French coffee. We liked our coffee and cigarettes, but you couldnrsquot get that it Scotland. Then we met the Crepescule crowd, and they had it much more together than we did. They all had flats and everything, and we were these pale little Scottish guys pretending to be sophisticated.The album cover image for The Scottish Affairis a reproduction of the poster for the Beursschouwburg gig, featuring artwork by Jean-Francois Octave that epitomised the ennui of serious young men. The -odd minute recording itself captures Josef K at their frenetic peak.ldquoSome moments sound really intense, says Haig. ldquoItrsquos always a bit weird going back, because it feels like a letime ago, but I think it stands up.Once Josef K split, Haig formed Rhythm of Le, a loose-knit umbrella organisation that produced a couple of singles before releasing numerous albums under his own name. Having briefly come up for air a decade ago for a handful of rare live dates, Haig continues to release new material, with his most recent album, The Wood, released last year on Les Disques du Crepescule.Ross joined Orange Juice, then Aztec Camera before embarking on a solo career that saw him release two albums. He made an album with The Low Mfs, and is currently part of The Bum-Clocks with Fire Engines drummer Russell Burn and his actor brother Tam Dean Burn. The Bum-Clocks also form part of Out of the Ordinary, the Edinburgh supergroup put together by maverick singer and composer, Joseph Malik.Both Haig and Ross express surprise at Josef Krsquos increasing cache over the years. This has come about through ious compilations, name-checks as an influence by the likes of Franz Ferdinand and their appearance in Grant McPheersquos Scottish post-punk documentary, Big Gold Dream. The release of The Scottish Affairadds to the historicising of their brief but vital lespan.ldquoI think for people interested in music of that period itrsquos an interesting document of its time, says Ross.For Haig, ldquoI think itrsquos quite an important document of what we were like that night, and because itrsquos a live experience it gives people who never had the chance to see Josef K an idea of how fast and intense it all was. Listening to it now, sometimes it takes me back, and sometimes itrsquos quite uncomfortable, but you really get the feeling it was a special night.The Scottish Affairby Josef K is available now on Les Disques du Crepescule. www.lesdisquesducrepescule"},{"url":null,"title":"memo-branch-office-labour-party-hq","story":"ldquoFury, despair, misery and denial was how Margaret Hodge summed up the feelings at this weekrsquos Parliamentary Labour Party post-mortem into the partyrsquos worst General Election defeat since . That was putting it mildly. The extent of the crisis perhaps only became truly clear when Tony Blair took time out from his lucrative retirement to give his tuppenceworth. It is always bad when Tone dares to show his face.The former Prime Minister, appearing as the artist who won three elections rather than the one who took the country into a disastrous war on a  prospectus, has had his think tank people drill down into the results and come up with a list of lessons Labour must learn.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Tony Blair: Labour must renew or face extinction\",\"description\": \"Tony Blair: Labour must renew or face extinction\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media rCvFz poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests rCvFz.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": : New constitution post idea rejectedThis was ldquono ordinary defeat for Labour said Mr Blair. Among the reasons for the disastrous outcome were an absence of leadership on Brexit, the adoption of ultra-left policies, a failure to deal with anti-Semitism, and the decision to back an election at a time when the leader was woefully unpopular.He did not miss and hit the wall. ldquoThe result has brought shame on us. We let our country down. To go into an election at any time with such a ergence between party and people is unacceptable. To do it at a time of national crisis when a credible opposition is essential to the national interest is unforgivable.Other opinions are available. Those looking for a starting point back to power would do well to listen to former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who lost her Wakefield seat last week.Ms Creaghrsquos mix of icy dignity and red hot rage was unleashed on Mr Corbyn when she came across him joking and laughing and taking selfies with youngsters. She was in the Commons to make her staff redundant, and so could be forgiven for being not quite in the festive mood.She was still furious when she went on Channel  News later to recount the clash with the not so dear leader. Her closing remarks contained a very important message, one that every party, indeed many an organisation and business, should have framed and placed on the wall. The Labour Party, said Ms Creagh, ldquohas no God-given right to exist.No God-given right to exist. There you have it. In time, this General Election will go down as the  flag poll, with parties posing as something they were not. Conservatives positioning themselves as champions of the working class. The SNP translating votes to stop Boris and Brexit into a push for another independence referendum. Labour presenting itself as a government in waiting when in reality it had long been an electoral disaster waiting to happen. Now Labour, facing the threat that Ms Creagh outlined, has to change, but how : ScotRail franchise cut shortAs a rare piece of luck would have it, there is guidance close at hand. If Labour wants to swerve oblivion it should look north to what happened to the party in Scotland. Just as Scotland was used as a testing ground for the poll tax, so the country has hosted something of an experiment into what it takes for a mighty electoral force, in power for generations, to be reduced to just one remaining MP.Think of it as a memo from branch office to HQ.First, do not forget where you came from. London, and particularly north London, is not the UK. The big cities are not the country as a whole. For too long, Scottish MPs were used as lobby fodder by the Labour leadership in London. There were so many of them a few casualties come election time did not matter. As for calibre of candidate, any chump with a red rosette would do. In modern, social media-dominated politics and journalism, there is no hiding place for the incompetent and lazy.Second, be distinctive. As the old hymn has it: ldquoDare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone, dare to have a purpose firm, dare to make it known. Do not enter into damaging alliances with other parties who fundamentally do not have your best interests at heart. See the Better Together campaign in the independence referendum, and overtures from the SNP to the London Labour leadership in the  General Election. What did Labour get out of such talk  Nothing.: Johnsons chilling threat to BBCThird, stay relevant. Scottish Labour failed to pick up on, then keep pace with, Scotlandrsquos increasing sense of national pride and desire to go its own way. When Labour did wake up to the need for change it drted between being grudging and resentful or patronising. Come election time, the party that had so long identied with Scotland found Scotland was no longer ing its calls.Fourth, elect a good leader. It cannot be stressed enough what a disaster Mr Corbyn has been to your continued chances of existence.Distant, vacillating, stubborn, unable to think on his feet, he was the gt to the opposition that kept on giving. He was also the prisoner of a coterie of hard left ex-public schoolboys, lelong practitioners of student politics, and union leaders old enough to know better.Now, it may seem rum for Scotland to advise on Labour leaders. In any sane scenario, the party chief up here would also have quit on losing all but one MP. But take it from Scotland, a country that has watched Labour leaders decline from the sublime to the unfunny ridiculous, finding the right person matters. Be as ruthless as the Tories in picking someone who can win elections. You can be as principled as you like, butyou are not in power nothing can get done.Fth, and this is perhaps the toughest goal of all to achieve, be lucky in your competitors, or at least have the means and guts to stand up to them. Scottish Labour has been consistently outperformed by a governing party that has never lost the knack of behaving like an opposition. The SNP has grown fat in power and MSP and MP numbers, but it has stayed hungry for the fight.Taking on the Tories and their -seat majority is not going to be easy.

ndash what kind of country and society do we want to be At the heart of these questions is a belief held by almost everyone in Scotland that we are a nation.No better and no worse than any other ndash but an equal nation.And as a nation, our future ndash whatever we choose it to be ndash must be in the hands of the people who live here.We can choose to stay part of the Westminster union or we can choose ndash as I would ndash to be independent.But the choice must be ours.Today, I am publishing the constitutional and democratic case for Scotland having that choice.It is rooted in the principle of self-determination, in the material change of circumstances since the  exercise of that right, and in the democratic mandate that exists for offering the choice afresh.In a voluntary association of nations such as the UK, it cannot be in the interest of any part for our right to choose our own future to be conditional, or time limited, or a one off.Nor is it right for it to be over-ridden by a Prime Minister, or indeed a First Minister.It is a fundamental right of self-determination.The ability for Scotland to exercise that right now matters, because the alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us.Scotland made clear last week that it doesnrsquot want a Tory government, led by Boris Johnson, taking us out of Europe and down a path we havenrsquot chosen.But that is the future we facewe donrsquot have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence.And it is a very dferent future to the one in prospect when Scotland voted No to independence in .There has been a material change in circumstances.There is also a democratic mandate to offer that choice.In the election last Thursday the SNP campaigned explicitly on the clear pledge that Scotlandrsquos future should be in Scotlandrsquos hands.Our manesto said this:ldquoAn SNP election victory will be a clear instruction by the people of Scotland that a new referendum on independence should be held next year, on a precise date to be determined by the Scottish Parliament.The SNP won that election ndash convincingly ndash with a higher vote share and a higher percentage of seats than the Tories won UK wide.The Conservatives in Scotland, who campaigned relentlessly on the single issue of opposition to another referendum, lost ndash overwhelmingly.The SNP victory last week follows others in  and .So the mandate we have to offer the Scottish people a choice over their future is, by any normal standard of democracy, unarguable.Now let me be clear ndash again ndash that I donrsquot take the outcome of an independence referendum for granted.Nor do I assume that everyone who voted SNP last week necessarily supports independence.I recognise the work we have to do to persuade a clear majority of people in Scotland that independence is the best future for our country.That is why in the months ahead, we will update the detailed and substantive case for Scotland becoming an independent nation.And, of course, in a referendum, those who believe that Scotland should stay part of the Westminster union will be able to make that case.So I accept that the case for independence is yet to be won.But the election last week put beyond reasonable argument our mandate to offer people in Scotland the choice.:Nicola Sturgeon demands permanent referendum power for HolyroodWe built a coalition around this principle.And now the election is over, I believe an even broader coalition is being formed.The right to choose is not just a demand from me as First Minister or from the SNP.It is based on the solemn right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future.The Scottish Government believes that right should be exercised free from the threat of legal challenge.In line with our values, we acknowledge that a referendum must be legal and that it must be accepted as legitimate, here in Scotland and the rest of the UK as well as in the EU and the wider international community.We are therefore today calling for the UK Government to negotiate and agree the transfer of power that would put beyond doubt the Scottish Parliamentrsquos right to legislate for a referendum on independence.Together with the constitutional and democratic case for that transfer of power, we are also publishing the draft legislation that would give effect to it.Of course, I anticipate that in the short term we will simply hear a restatement of the UK governmentrsquos opposition.But they should be under no illusion that this will be an end of the matter.We will continue to pursue the democratic case for Scotlandrsquos right to choose.We will do so in a reasonable and considered manner.And we are setting out that case in detail because we believe that the UK government ndash on this as on any issue ndash has a duty to respond in a similarly considered and reasonable manner.Of course, much of the debate at Westminster has been based on the idea that it is the right of the Westminster Parliament and the Prime Minister of the day ndash not the people who live here ndash to determine Scotlandrsquos future.In this context the question is often posed to me ndash what will you doBoris Johnson says no As I have said before, I will consider all reasonable options to secure Scotlandrsquos right to self-determination.In the New Year, I will also ask the Scottish Parliament to back the case we are publishing today, and we will work to grow and deepen the coalition of support for Scotlandrsquos right to choose.But the document we are publishing today turns the question on its head.It is for the Prime Minister to defend why he believes the UK is not a voluntary union of equal nations.It is for the Prime Minister to set out why he does not believe people in Scotland have the right to self-determination.It is for the Prime Minister to explain why he believes it is acceptable to ignore election after election in Scotland and to over-ride a democratic mandate stronger than the one he claims for his Brexit deal.The Conservativersquos only response to this, so far, has been the referendum result in .:Nicola Sturgeon urges public to back her in indyref fightThey use that result to justy doing whatever they like to Scotland no matter what people here think and no matter how much damage they cause to peoplersquos lives.The Tories are in effect saying to people here that democracy in Scotland stopped the day we voted No in That cannot and will not hold.In  a majority of people in Scotland did indeed vote No.But in  an overwhelming majority voted to remain in the European Union.Despite that overwhelming vote, within a matter of weeks the Tories intend to remove Scotland from the EU.The future the people of Scotland once chose is no longer available to themBut itrsquos not just the fact that the Tories want to take Scotland out of the EU against our will and contrary to the promises they made in .They dismissed a compromise proposal to stay in the Single Market.Theyrsquove taken powers from the Scottish Parliament.Theyrsquore threatening workersrsquo rights and environmental standards.Their migration policy will lead to a fall in our working population and hit our economy hard.A Tory-Trump trade deal will leave our NHS at the mercy of US drugs companies.Their social security policy will drive many more children into poverty.They are imposing damaging change, stripping us of rights and re-making our future without our consent.All of this, and more, is being done against the wishes of the people of Scotland.That is not a Union worthy of the name ndash and it is most certainly not a Union of equals.It is instead a raw assertion of Westminster control over Scotland. And it is not sustainable.The Tory position will not prevail ndash democracy will.So today I urge people in Scotland, regardless of our dfering views on independence, to rally round the case for Scotlandrsquos right to choose ndash our right to self-determination.This is not the time for Scotland to give up on reasoned and democratic argument ndash it is the time to pursue it ever more confidently.Letrsquos assert our rights as an equal nation and partner.Letrsquos imagine a better country.A Scotland which is at the heart of Europe.A welcoming, outward-looking nation.A country where the country gets the governments it votes for.A Scotland with full powers to lt children out of poverty, create a fairer country and a more prosperous economy.A better future is possible.And it is our future that is on the line ndash we have the right to decide what it should be.So just as we did back in the s to break Tory opposition and win a Scottish Parliament, let us now come together under the banner of our right to self-determination.And let us put Scotlandrsquos future into Scotlandrsquos hands."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-makes-formal-request-section-30-order","story":"The

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Putting police data in the cloud had never been done before anywhere in Europe and as the programme developed, a number of challenges more dficult than originally expected, came to light, resulting in us spending more money and taking longer than we had anticipated.“Disclosure Scotland has taken the greatest care to spend public money wisely and will continue to do so.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter.

It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"boxing promoter bob arum apologises for ira comments as frampton and conlan say no malice intended","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the NMC figures,\" added Ms Cullen.\"Our members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.\"Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged.\"Further strikes are planned for January  and  ahead of the January  deadline for politicians here to re-establish the Assembly.A breakthrough to bring an end to the health service crisis appeared unlikely on Wednesday night, with the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Department of Health, unions and politicians disintegrating even further.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has refused to budge from his position that health is a devolved matter.After roundtable talks with the political parties, he said again he was unable to intervene and approach the Treasury for additional funding.However, unions have rejected this stance. They have also accused Mr Smith of using the crisis as leverage to force the political parties back into talks to re-establish the Assembly.Patricia McKeown from Unison launched a stinging attack on the head of the local Civil Service, David Sterling.He and the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, have insisted that they cannot bring pay into line with the rest of the UK because it would mean overturning a ministerial decision.In an open letter to Mr Sterling, Ms McKeown argued this position was incorrect and hit out at comments he made in a letter sent to the leaders of the political parties on Tuesday.In the correspondence, Mr Sterling said that in order to meet pay parity demands, the Department of Health would need an additional £m every year.He said this money could alternatively be used to pay for additional activity to reduce the number of people on waiting lists each year by ,.\"It is important to note that other Northern Ireland departments are currently dealing with serious budgetary pressure, including pay pressures,\" he wrote.\"Indeed, there are currently industrial disputes in other parts of the public sector.\"The principle of public sector pay parity is clearly cross-cutting, with potential implications well beyond health.\" In response, Ms McKeown hit out at the fact that Mr Sterling has still not responded to a letter Unison sent to him on November , in which the union sought his intervention to resolve the ongoing dispute.Describing Mr Sterlings letter as \"a deeply unhelpful intervention\", she said she was \"shocked by the apparent attempt to mislead party leaders and the overtly political tone of the letter\".She said a letter from the five political parties providing cover to allow civil servants to meet unions pay demands was sufficient political authority for him to act.\"This having now been provided, we seriously question your failure to act,\" she added.She also said Mr Sterling and the Department of Finance have been creating pay policy in the absence of ministers, such as a recent announcement of a review of public sector pay.Ms McKeown also rejected the argument that there was no ministerial decision to break parity and said that it had instead been argued that the move was necessary to enable the Department of Health to break even.She added: \"We have repeatedly stated that the Treasury should provide whatever additional resources are needed to restore the pay gap.\"You have a clear role in making that argument to them.\"Health workers have kept the system running in the face of continued cuts and austerity.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic and travel latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Mr Hariri resigned on October  in response to unprecedented mass protests against the entire political class while an already dire economic crisis was quickly deteriorating.Since then, efforts to agree on a new prime minister and the shape of government have kept hitting a dead end. Mr Hariri, who is aligned with the West and Gulf countries, has insisted he would head a Cabinet made up of specialists to deal with the economic and financial crisis — a key demand of the protest movement — while the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which initially backed him, has demanded a government that includes all major political factions.On Thursday, Hezbollah said it backed Mr Diab for prime minister. Mohammed Raad, the spokesman for the group’s parliamentary bloc, said he hoped Mr Diab receives enough votes and for him to “succeed in his national duties”, and vowed to cooperate in tackling the current crisis.Binding consultations between Mr Aoun and representatives of the -member parliament were delayed twice as Lebanon saw some of the worst violence since protests erupted in mid-October. The clashes have involved security forces and anti-government protesters, as well as supporters of Lebanon’s two main Shiite groups, Hezbollah and Amal.In Lebanon’s sectarian-based political system, the prime minister has to be from the Sunni Muslim community."},{"url":null,"title":"nancy pelosi says impeachment leaves spring in peoples step","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

TrumpDecember , Ms Pelosi was upbeat the morning after the historic vote that made Mr Trump only the third president in US history to be impeached.The House impeached Mr Trump on two charges — abusing his presidential power and obstructing Congress — stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rival as Mr Trump withheld US aid.“We’ve been hearing from people all over the country,” Ms Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol.“Seems like people have a spring in their step because the president was held accountable for his reckless behaviour.”Pressed about next steps, Ms Pelosi would not say.“The next thing will be when we see the process that is set forth in the Senate,” Ms Pelosi said.“Then we’ll know the number of managers we may have to go forward and who we would choose.”She said the previous night, “So far we haven’t seen anything that looks fair to us. So hopefully it will be fair. And when we see what that is, we’ll send our managers.”The Democratic speaker and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer met privately on Thursday at the Capitol after Republican Senate Leader McConnell signalled in the strongest terms yet that his chamber intended to hold a swt trial and acquit the president of both charges.Mr McConnell denounced the “most unfair” House impeachment and reassured Mr Trump and his supporters that “moments like this are why the United States Senate exists”.The impeachment of a president is a solemn and serious moment for our country.At the start of a trial in the Senate, all senators will swear an oath to render impartial justice.The American people deserve that the Senate conduct a full and fair trial.— Chuck SchumerDecember , As for what the Senate would do, he said, “It could not be clearer which outcome would serve the stabilising, institution-preserving, fever-breaking role for which the United States Senate was created and which outcome would betray it.”Mr McConnell described Mr Trump’s impeachment as “the most rushed, least thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the House voted to impeach President Donald Trump Fighting back and using Mr McConnell’s own words, Mr Schumer said the Republican leader was plotting the “most rushed, least thorough and most unfair” impeachment trial in history by declining to agree to call witnesses including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who declined to testy before the House.“McConnell claimed the impeachment was motivated by partisan rage,” said Mr Schumer. “This from the man who said proudly, ‘I am not impartial’.”“What hypocrisy.”Ms Pelosi said that Mr McConnell “says it’s OK for the foreman of the jury to be in cahoots with the lawyers of the accused.

That is among the key findings in a report on “Major Capital Projects published today, Thursday  December, by Northern Ireland’s Comptroller and Auditor General, Kieran Donnelly. Mr Donnelly’s report provides a high-level overview of the Northern Ireland public sector major capital projects portfolio and departmental progress in delivering eleven projects. These include the seven flagship infrastructure projects identied by the NI Executive in  as its highest priority projects. Alongside the A and A roads are a Mother and Children’s Hospital, Belfast Transport Hub, Belfast Rapid Transit, Regional and Sub-Regional Stadia and Desertcreat College. In addition, there are four projects which have experienced problems together with details of performance against business cases. Ulster Universitys Greater Belfast Development is said to have encountered signicant problems and now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap.The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing pound million capital grant.The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound. million including  per cent Value Added Taxwhich is irrecoverable.Of the seven flagship projects examined, none have been delivered in line with both original time and budget estimates. Departments attributed this to a range of common issues: funding constraints, legal challenges, planning issues, and a lack of interest from the construction industry. Commenting on the report’s findings, Mr Donnelly said: Major capital projects are complex, and delivery problems are not unique to Northern Ireland. That said, it is disappointing that, while some projects are delivered on time and within budget, many suffer signicant cost overruns and time delays. “Even flagship projects identied as the Northern Ireland Executive’s highest priority, and with funding secured over a longer period, have not met their original delivery targets.” Mr Donnelly added: “Existing, cumbersome governance and delivery structures within the Northern Ireland public sector can be a barrier to achieving value for money. I believe there is merit in considering alternative models, sufficiently resourced with specialist staff, to help improve future delivery.” In response to the issues raised by Departments, Mr Donnelly’s report notes that he will be conducting two future studies - one considering the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland planning system at central and local government level, and another on identying the lessons arising from Judicial Reviews. Further in-depth studies of inidual major capital projects will also be conducted to assess whether value for money has been achieved. googletag.cmd.push ‘Damning’ SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan said the report is “damning” and unsurprisingly identies major issues in the delivery of flagship projects West of the Bann including the A and A.He added thatanything should spur assembly members back to doing their work it should be this report on major capital projects which have either been delivered late or overrun costs.The Foyle MLA said: “This report is shocking by any standards and underlines the lack of oversight by elected representatives and the failure to adopt new models as has happened in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.“The report also makes clear the gross disparity in capital projects between Britain and Northern Ireland when there should have been a commitment to make up for the neglect of the past. That clearly wasn’t a priority for those who made the assembly unworkable.”He continued: “One of the documents completed during talks earlier this year, brought agreement on openness and transparency and that must be central to ensuring that reports of this nature from the Audit Office are a thing of the past.“Every single pound spent on capital projects must be based on best practice and be fully accounted for. That won’t happen while members are not at Stormont and it certainly can’t happen without partnership, involving all parties, working effectively.”He concluded: “There is a golden opportunity now for all of us to roll up our sleeves, burn the midnight oil and make this place a model for accountability and best practice.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The latest work by UV Artsreflects their experience of working with Older People North West and young people from Foyle Down’s Syndrome Trust on creative street art, a project  made possible through the help of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Good Relations programme. The gable used to be defaced with graffiti. The mural, as Karl Porter, explained was their artistic interpretation of the activities and energies they experienced across the road in Malvern House.   Karl said: “The artists felt it was important to reflect a strong image of an older person, who has been nicknamed affectionately ‘Our Muriel.’  “ Both he and  Donal O Doherty  felt it was important to highlight the fact that creativity flourishes in all age groups.  “Having led workshops in Malvern House earlier in the year,  they came up with the striking  vision for the Chapel Road mural.”“Age is only a number” reflects a discussion between the artists and workshop attendees.   “A wee bird told me” captures the reminiscence and storytelling activities that the artists observed.  “The love of dancing  in Malvern House just had to be there,” said Karl,  “and the red triangle surrounding ‘Our Muriel’ addresses the stereotypical stooped old couple with a stick image  as represented in the road sign down the street. We wanted to get away from that.” Both Donal and Karl of UV Arts were at pains to say that “Muriel’s face” is their artistic vision and not based on any person.  However, that is not stopping the discussions across the street in Older People North West, where many erse claims have been made about whom the face is  modelled on .    The mural is now a  Chapel Road landmark opposite Older People North West.   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The action is also being taken over concerns about staffing levels within the health care sector.Yesterday saw the first occasion in more than a century that nurses represented by the Royal College of Nursing took strike action.Under legislation, there will have to be an Assembly election called heredevolution is not restored by  January. The power- sharing government led by the DUP and Sinn Fein collapsed almost three years ago in January . Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Julian Smith, has stated that with the health service in crisis local political leaders must find a way to restore the Assembly. The Irish Government has also pledged to work “night and day” in a bid to make Stormont al again. Tanaiste Simon Coveney said there was no intention of “bouncing” the Northern Ireland parties back into government, adding they had been discussing the same issues for many months now. This is not about trying to force the parties into a space they dont want to move into. But weve had a reality check with the nurses strike, and I think its a reminder to everyone that now is the time to get this done, he said. The negotiations are also expected to move into round table discussions with Julian Smith and Simon Coveney later this week.PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne has also added his voice to the ongoing talks by urging politicians to find an agreed way to deal with the legacy of the Troubles and he also called for parties to back his calls to employ more police officers.Meanwhile, newly-elected Foyle MP, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, contended last week’s General Election results illustrated people were “sick of the Stormont standoff.”Mr Eastwood also called on both the Irish and British Governments to publish a document showing what had been agreed so far.He added: “The scale of the challenge we face is immense. Our Health Service is in crisis - waiting lists are spiralling out of control and hardworking healthcare staff demand and deserve pay parity with their counterparts across these islands. Our schools are on the verge of a full-blown resource catastropheurgent action isn’t taken. And critical investment across the North is being delayed by a failure of political leadership. It has to stop now.“The SDLP has made bold proposals that are uncomfortable for us but are in the interests of restoring government to meet the needs of patients, pupils and healthcare workers. We will continue to stretch ourselves but it is for the DUP and Sinn Feacutein to set aside their dispute and act, at last, in the interests of the people we all represent,” he added.Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, claimed Mr Smith refused to meet the five main parties on the issue of the health strike.Ms O’Neill said: “There is a consensus among party leaders that a resolution can be found by the British Secretary of State Julian Smith and civil servants.“The pay and staffing issue must not be used as a political football within the talks. Party leaders restated there is consensusthe Executive is restored by January  that we will adopt a policy towards pay parity.“On that basis we invited the Secretary of State to come and meet with the five party leaders, where he would provide a commitment to deliver this in the event of no agreement by that date. Regrettably he refused to meet the leaders.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Matthew was originally set to face Ger Harris from SBG Charlestown to defend his flyweight title but unfortunately Ger had to pull the fight in the last week leading up to the fight.Matthew, the current flyweight Champion of Akuma, stepped up a weight class on a weeks notice to fight for the Akuma Bantamweight Championship belt against Ryanos Jamie Abbott. Mathew won the fight by unanimous decision to claim the belt with a dominant  round performance.Coach Ciaran Mc Fadden was delighted but not surprised:“Matthew is probably the UKs most active fighter with  MMA fights this year,” he said. “From the bottom of the card first fight to the headlining main event inside  year is a fantastic effort. I have been training Matthew about  or  years and its unreal what hes achieved in that time frame, the future is bright.Kombat also had another local fighter on the card - James Slavin - who was unlucky after a hard fought fight, and some good show of his skills on the feet losing the match ultimately to Aaron Daniel from Sbg.More recently, Dylan Howell and James Slavin from Kombat recently competed in a K Kickboxing show Fightclub Circus  in Armagh.Dylan won his contest with a first round knock-out in  seconds while James won a unanimous decision after  rounds of action, a brilliant effort from both.Overall Kombat Jiu jitsu have collected  x MMA titles this year and  x K kickboxing Irish Title.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
