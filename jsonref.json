The rate is similar to the same period in 2017 - but crucially there has been a dramatic fall in the number of openings year-on-year.Compared with 2,342 shops opening their doors in the first six months of last year, there were 1,569 openings between January 1 and June 30.    Gourmet Burger KitchenThe posh burger chain has revealed plans to close 17 of its 85 restaurants after tough competition took a bite out of its performance. Other restaurants that have undertaken company voluntary arrangements so far this year include Carluccio\u0027s, Byron, Prezzo, Gaucho and Jamie\u0027s Italian.House of FraserThe department store fell into administration and was bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley. He has said he will aim to keep 47 of the 59 stores open, with three closures in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon already announced.Marks \u0026amp SpencerHigh street stalwart M\u0026ampS is to shut 100 stores by 2022 in a radical overhaul of its estate. Profits at the company have slumped by almost two-thirds due to the costly closure plan combined with a decline in sales across key departments.          HomebaseThe DIY chain is set to close 80 stores, hitting up to 2,000 jobs. It follows a botched takeover by Australia\u0027s Wesfarmers.PoundworldCalled in administrators in June in a move affecting 5,100 jobs. The business was hit by falling footfall, alongside rising costs and weak consumer confidence. All stores have now been closed.Toys R UsThe toy chain went into administration on the last day of February after failing to find a third-party buyer. It came after HMRC sought to recover £15 million in unpaid VAT and this finally tipped the company into administration.MaplinOne of the UK\u0027s biggest electronics retailers collapsed into administration on the same day as Toys R Us after talks with buyers failed to secure a sale. The business faced the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote, weak consumer confidence and a withdrawal of credit insurance.          MothercareThe ailing baby goods and maternity retailer will close 50 to 60 stores as part of a planned turnaround.CarpetrightThe embattled flooring firm is embarking on a store closure programme, also part of a restructuring, after announcing heavy losses.New LookThe clothing chain announced earlier this year it would close 60 UK stores and cut 1,000 jobs as part of a financial restructuring.          Conviviality RetailingThe major drinks and off-licence supplier, which owns Wine Rack and Bargain Booze, went into administration in early April. The company had grown too quickly by merger, there were a series of profit warnings and a £30 million tax bill for which Conviviality was forced to ask for extra funds from investors - who refused.Warren EvansThe bed, mattress and furniture retailer in London and the south-east went into administration one week after putting itself up for sale. The company, known for its ethical stance, had been losing money for some time under the pressure of rising costs and shrinking customer spending.Calvetron          The owner of Jacques Vert, Windsmoor, Dash and Eastex fashion brands, which ran about 300 UK concessions in stores including Debenhams and House of Fraser, went into administration at the start of May. Bosses said inflation and wage freezes had been a driving force behind decreased spending.Juice CorporationThe firm behind fashion brand Joe Bloggs and the retailer that designed the wedding dress for Diana, Princess of Wales, collapsed into administration in January. Although the group made profits, it had failed to make inroads into the fashion market.CoastWomenswear retailer Coast went into administration in mid-October, impacting 300 jobs at 24 stores. But sister brand Karen Millen bought out parts of the business, rescuing around 600 jobs at 145 department store concessions.                                                    Greater London and the South East were the regions worst hit by closures of chains, followed by the Midlands, the North East and East of England. Wales was the best-performing region, although it still saw a net loss of 22.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said the continued rate of store closures \u0027reflects the new reality that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home\u0027.\u0027The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts,\u0027 she said.          Retail trends: Sales across key sectors in Britain\u0027s retail industry since May 2017, according to BDO.\u0027Openings simply aren\u0027t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across experiential chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven\u0027t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.\u0027Looking ahead, the turmoil facing the sector is unlikely to abate. Store closures already announced in the second half of the year due to administrations and Company Voluntary Arrangements already will further intensify the situation.\u0027Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, told The Guardian: \u0027The pressure on retailers, which is contributing to store closures, will continue unless the government takes decisive action.\u0027          Hard times: Marks \u0026amp Spencer saw its clothing and food sales fall in the first half of the yearHe also called for the Government to address \u0027spiralling business rates for the larger businesses that employ the majority of the UK\u0027s 3.1million retail workers\u0027.High streets minister Jake Berry said: \u0027The Government recognises the challenges facing high streets driven by changing consumer behaviour.\u0027That is why the Budget has high streets at its heart. We have created a £675million fund to help high streets adapt, slashed business rates by a third for the majority of smaller businesses, and are creating a task force guided by Sir John Timpson, one of the UK\u0027s most experienced retailers, to ensure that high streets are adapting for rapid change and are fit for the future.\u0027These measures totalling over £1.5billion show the Government\u0027s determination to make thriving high streets a permanent part of every community in England.\u0027Now share your opinionToys R Us, Maplin, Poundworld and Coast have been among the major fatalities on the high street so far in 2018, while House of Fraser was rescued from administration by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley.Debenhams, Mothercare, Homebase and Carpetright are all closing outlets. Mark \u0026amp Spence, which is also in the midst of a closure programme yesterday revealed disappointing food and clothes sales fro the first half of the year.CVAs have been used with increased frequency as large and established chains struggle to meet their rental and rates costs. Jamie\u0027s Italian and Prezzo have announced CVAs, while Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Byron are also utilising the arrangements.The BDO report suggested that love-it-or-loathe-it Black Friday on the horizon, many shoppers shunned the high street in October and are holding out for better deals. Online sales growth came in at 10.5 per cent last month, marking the third lowest monthly result since the tracker data was first published in 2010.Including online and in-store sales, like-for-like retail sales grew by 1 per cent last month, the report said.       Footfall in shopping centres was down every week in October, falling by 4.3 per cent in the third week, when many children were off for the school holidays.Retail parks fared slightly better, seeing an increase in footfall for half of the month.Summing up the state of the sector, BDO said: \u0027The critical final quarter of 2018 got off to an ugly start with a very poor performance for bricks-and-mortar and relatively slack growth for nonstore sales in the month of October. \u0027With recent indicators pointing towards consumer confidence decreasing further, marking concerns over personal finances and reluctance on the part of consumers to make major purchases, it will be difficult for retailers to recover in the final months of the year, potentially threatening upcoming promotional dates both in-store and online.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Three Grenfell Six Conservative Club membership SUSPENDED","story":"    Clifford Smith posted this image to Facebook, appearing to mock the homeless          Bonfire Night party-goers, including Smith, laughed as they torch a replica of Grenfell TowerLord of the manor!

He says archly: \u0027I always wonder what meddling is? I mean I always thought it was motivating.\u0027But I\u0027ve always been intrigued, if it\u0027s meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago and what was happening or not happening there – the conditions in which people were living. If that\u0027s meddling I\u0027m very proud of it.\u0027Documentary-maker John Bridcut admitted Prince Charles appeared to resent the word meddling when he asked him the question.He said today: \u0027He bridled a bit at the word meddling and said he prefers the word motivating\u0027.Mr Bridcut said Charles\u0027 wife Camilla says the \u0027burden\u0027 of being the next monarch \u0027does not weigh heavily on his shoulders because he has known all his life it is going to happen\u0027.He added: \u0027Actually he told me he it might be rather relieving to step back from that rather more front line role he\u0027s carried on as Prince of Wales\u0027. Former cabinet minister Lord Hain says \u0027I don\u0027t see why the future monarch should be expected to be completely viewless and silent on everything\u0027Lord Hain added: \u0027I\u0027ve never been a monarchist, but if you believe in a monarchy, then I don\u0027t see why the monarch currently or the future monarch should be expected to be completely view-less and silent on everything.\u0027Asked if he thought it was a shame that Charles has said he will not speak out on issues, Lord Hain said: \u0027No. I respect his point of view, just as I respected our dialogues when I was in government.\u0027But anti-monarchy campaigners Republic said: \u0027The royal PR machine are facing a crisis as Charles prepares to take the throne.\u0027The organisation added: \u0027Charles has routinely abused his position of power, privately lobbying cabinet ministers and influencing government policy with his own political agenda. \u0027King Charles is just around the corner and we should be having a wide-ranging national debate about our country\u0027s future, not a coronation by default.\u0027Melbourne man \u0027sets fire to car and charges at police with knife\u0027Harry discusses moment he asked his father to walk Meghan down the aisleMan is shot by Police on Bourke Street following attackMan is arrested after fire and attack in Melbourne\u0027s Bourke StRoad rage row ends in fight after drivers grapple to the floorBourke St attacker wields knife as man pushes trolley onto himCamilla believes Prince Charles \u0027destiny\u0027 doesn\u0027t weigh on himMelanie C: \u0027Victoria said we never asked her about a reunion!\u0027Prince William and Harry watch Prince Charles 1970\u0027s speech on plasticPrince Charles says there can only be \u0027one sovereign at a time\u0027Prince Charles on taking risks when it comes to charity workCharles and the Queen stuck in Buckingham Palace \u0027traffic jam\u0027    Charles says: \u0027You can\u0027t be the same as the sovereign if you\u0027re the Prince of Wales or the heir.

It reveals that:Charles is such a workaholic that he often falls asleep at his desk at midnight with a memo stuck to his foreheadWhen the Duchess of Sussex found out her father would not be walking her down the aisle, Charles immediately volunteeredPrince William wishes his father could spend more time with grandchildren George, Charlotte and LouisAlthough born to be king, Charles does not think about his destiny muchWilliam insists he wants to be his \u0027own man\u0027 as Prince of Wales.Documentary-makers were  given unrivalled access to Charles for a year, watching him at close quarters both at work and in private.And although a sensitive subject with the prince, the issue of his life-long lobbying was difficult to ignore.Over the years, the prince has been accused of risking the monarch\u0027s constitutional impartiality by meddling in government policy.Tales of his so-called \u0027black spider memos\u0027, the regular missives written to ministers calling for action in his distinctive scrawled handwriting, have left many uneasy about his ability to be a neutral monarch.In the interview the prince confronts the issue directly, pointing out that as the longest-serving heir to the throne in British history – he inherited the role at the age of just four – it was his duty to find a way to live a productive public life.He compares his role to that of the 14th-century Black Prince, a predecessor as Prince of Wales and commander during the Hundred Years\u0027 War.Charles says: \u0027Each one of my predecessors had to find out how they would do it, a lot of them dropped dead or were killed before they got very far.\u0027I mean the Black Prince was the first one and he rushed about doing all the complicated bits and fighting battles while his father sat somewhere else. So you know he was busy winning his spurs, and in a sense that\u0027s still what has to happen.\u0027Charles says as a young man he was encouraged to \u0027get involved\u0027 by political leaders. \u0027I remember Jim Callaghan who was prime minister and he invited me to come and spend the whole day at No 10,\u0027 he recalled.\u0027I sat in on all his meetings, and the Cabinet meeting and his briefing before going to the House of Commons for Question Time, and then I was sent round all the different ministries to find out what went on.\u0027You have to make of it what you feel is right. There\u0027s nothing laid down – that\u0027s what makes it so interesting, challenging and of course complicated.\u0027When pushed by Mr Bridcut, who points out that people have openly expressed concern that he won\u0027t be able to resist getting involved, Charles explodes: \u0027I\u0027m not that stupid.\u0027He agrees that he could continue to use his \u0027convening\u0027 power – the ability to bring disparate people and groups together – but only \u0027with the agreement of ministers\u0027.Charles rarely gives interviews of a personal nature. The last one was to presenter Jonathan Dimbleby in 1994 when he admitted adultery.And he has never confronted the issue of how he intends to conduct himself as monarch before, believing it unseemly to refer to anything that involves the death of his mother.But it is understood the prince believes now is the time to lay to rest the suggestion that he will be anything other than constitutionally neutral.Charles\u0027s mention of his work in the inner cities is a reference to the highly successful Prince\u0027s Trust for disadvantaged youngsters.He also describes himself as a \u0027risk taker\u0027 when it comes to some of his public work, like Dumfries House, the Scottish stately home that he controversially saved after taking out a £20 million loan and has since turned into a thriving charity hub. The prince says: \u0027Having taken the risks, I believe in living dangerously.\u0027Prince, Son and Heir - Charles at 70 is on BBC One at 9pm tonight.Melbourne man \u0027sets fire to car and charges at police with knife\u0027Harry discusses moment he asked his father to walk Meghan down the aisleMan is shot by Police on Bourke Street following attackMan is arrested after fire and attack in Melbourne\u0027s Bourke StRoad rage row ends in fight after drivers grapple to the floorBourke St attacker wields knife as man pushes trolley onto himCamilla believes Prince Charles \u0027destiny\u0027 doesn\u0027t weigh on himMelanie C: \u0027Victoria said we never asked her about a reunion!\u0027Prince William and Harry watch Prince Charles 1970\u0027s speech on plasticPrince Charles says there can only be \u0027one sovereign at a time\u0027Prince Charles on taking risks when it comes to charity workCharles and the Queen stuck in Buckingham Palace \u0027traffic jam\u0027    Beaming Prince Charles received an early birthday treat yesterday – a compliment from a supermodel.

Prince William wishes his workaholic father could spend more time with his grandchildren, the documentary to mark Charles\u0027 70th birthday reveals. (Above, at Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding in May)  The Prince of Wales is described as a \u0027brilliant\u0027 grandfather who will spend hours crawling on the floor and making silly noises with his little granddaughters and grandsons          The prince can, however, be distracted because he is so dedicated to his work – to the extent that his sons say he sometimes falls asleep with the documents he is reading stuck to his face.. (Pictured, father and son at the Invictus Games in 2014)HANDS-ON GRANDFATHERAsked whether his father has \u0027time to be a grandfather on top of everything else\u0027, William answers carefully.In recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed.But his elder son makes clear that he would like to have more \u0027family time\u0027 with his hard-working father.William says: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027m working more heavily on, put it that way. I think he does have time for it, but I would like him to have more time with the children.          In recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed\u0027Now he\u0027s reached his 70th year it\u0027s a perfect time to consolidate a little bit because, as most families would do, you are worried about having them around and making sure their health\u0027s OK – and he\u0027s the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until he\u0027s 95.\u0027So having more time with him at home would be lovely, and being able to play around with the grandchildren. \u0027Because when he\u0027s there, he\u0027s brilliant. But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027Camilla adds: \u0027He will get down on his knees and crawl about with them for hours, you know making funny noises and laughing, and my grandchildren adore him, absolutely adore him. He reads Harry Potter and he can do all the different voices and I think children really appreciate that.\u0027 Aides say Charles could not be prouder to be a grandfather.The prince happily shows the documentary crew an arboretum that he has planted for his eldest grandchild at Birkhall, his Scottish home, which he calls \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027.LITTER PICKERReferring to his passion for the environment and life-long campaign to highlight the perils of climate change, Harry reveals his father still can\u0027t help \u0027banging the drum\u0027 even when he sits down with his sons to dinner.He tells his brother: \u0027You know how frustrated he gets. But he\u0027s done an amazing job, and without telling us what he should be doing or the direction that we should go in, he\u0027s just let us learn from the nature of the job, learning from him, learning from Mummy.\u0027The programme reveals how Charles would take his sons litter picking when they were on holiday with him.He has also passed down some of his other quirkier traits.          Referring to his passion for the environment and life-long campaign to highlight the perils of climate change, Harry reveals his father (above, in 2014) still can\u0027t help \u0027banging the drum\u0027 even when he sits down with his sons to dinnerHarry reveals: \u0027He\u0027s a stickler for turning lights off.\u0027And that\u0027s now something that I\u0027m obsessed with as well, which is insane because actually my wife certainly goes \u0027Well why turn the lights off? You know it\u0027s dark\u0027.\u0027I go \u0027We only need one light, we don\u0027t need like six\u0027, and all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he\u0027s making, every single person can do. And I think that is one of the key lessons certainly that I felt that he taught us.\u0027William agrees, adding: \u0027I know I\u0027ve got serious OCD on light switches now which is terrible.\u0027He does life the way that he advocates. He did take to heart the criticism quite a lot when he was younger.\u0027247 WORKAHOLICIf there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down.Harry jokes: \u0027He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night.\u0027And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he\u0027ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.\u0027William agrees, saying: \u0027He has amazing personal discipline. So, he has – and it\u0027s frustrated me in the past a lot – he has a routine.\u0027The only way to fit all this stuff in is things have to be compartmentalised. The man never stops.          If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down\u0027I mean when we were kids there was bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him. We could barely even get to his desk to say goodnight to him.\u0027The Duchess of Cornwall says she tried to encourage her husband to \u0027pace himself\u0027 but admits he is too driven to take any notice.She smiles ruefully: \u0027My father once said to me, \u0027As you get older, you\u0027ve got to do one thing and that is pace yourself\u0027. And I would love to tell him to pace himself, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not going to happen.\u0027MAN OF DESTINYCharles neatly sums up the way his life has been mapped out before him, with astonishing matter of factness.He says: \u0027When my mama succeeded and became Queen when by grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne at aged four.\u0027And yet his wife says it is a weight he bears lightly.Asked whether the crown is something he often thinks about, Camilla says: \u0027No, I don\u0027t. \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027When she is asked if it is something he talks about, the duchess replies: \u0027Not very much, no. It\u0027s just something that\u0027s going to happen.\u0027  The Queen and Prince Charles surrounded by guests on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London during a star-studded concert to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday. Camilla says: \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all\u0027BIRTHDAY BOYAsked to give a message to the prince on his birthday, his sons are quick to reply.Harry laughs: \u0027Please have dinner earlier is my message to him! I would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative. \u0027But with hopefully his children and his grandchildren and hopefully more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u0027William adds: \u0027I\u0027m very pleased that he\u0027s made 70. You know if you ask him if the job\u0027s done, it\u0027s not.\u0027But more than anything I\u0027d like to see his passions and his interests and the things he\u0027s been campaigning for come to fruition completely for him. He hasn\u0027t even reached the point that his natural progression should do – i.e. being monarch. So, you know he\u0027s still got his job to do.\u0027      Do it like the Duchess of Sussex in a Goat dressStill available in blackMeghan Markle\u0026#39s Givenchy gown took the world\u0026#39s breath away when she walked down the aisle to meet her prince, and that Stella McCartney evening dress was just as beautiful.

He was 32 when he married for the first time, he romanced Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles more than 30 years before marrying her, and he has now waited until the eve of his 70th birthday before letting the world know what sort of king he will be.For many years, he has unburdened himself of his views on architecture, education, the environment, homeopathy and countless other subjects.He has shared his thoughts on faith, on duty and on his respect for tradition. But on kingship and the kind of monarch he sees himself as, he has largely been silent. In many ways, of course, it has been an entirely commendable position to adopt. Given the longevity of the Queen, to have done otherwise would have been not just discourteous to his mother, but potentially dangerous.However, the absence of any clear vision of what life under King Charles III will be like has led to a situation where his public interventions – notably those infamous \u0027black spider\u0027 memos to ministers – have seen him cast as a meddling monarch in waiting.Now, with one eye on the future and from the comfortable position of almost reaching his 70th – his birthday is next Wednesday – he has chosen to deal with these vital issues for the first time.Questioned in a TV documentary about those accusations and about his future role, his answers are both surprising and revealing.The film also sheds an intriguing light on his relationship with his sons William and Harry, and on his grandchildren. \u0027When he\u0027s there he\u0027s brilliant,\u0027 says William pointedly. \u0027But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027 What emerges from this 60-minute documentary is the most compelling – and intimate – picture of the Prince of Wales since the controversial Jonathan Dimbleby programme almost a quarter of a century ago.But while that film marked his anguish over his affair with Camilla, and hastened the final break-up of his marriage to Princess Diana, this one is likely to be remembered for him finally setting out how he will operate as king.Clearly irked by questions about his lobbying and the accusation of meddling, the prince says he is proud to have worried about inner cities and to have tackled other issues.Pressed about whether such campaigning will continue once he comes to the throne, he replies: \u0027I\u0027m not that stupid.\u0027Then, with one penetrating aside, he says: \u0027I think it\u0027s vital to remember there\u0027s only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. But the idea somehow that I\u0027m going to go on exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense.\u0027Here, in a handful of words we get to the heart of Prince Charles. On the one hand he is explaining why he has said nothing about his future role. There is the deep respect and, yes, love, for his 92-year-old mother, and a refusal to take anything for granted. \u0027If I have to succeed\u0027 is a telling phrase in itself.But there is another message here, too. And this one is directed at Prince William, who will himself succeed to Prince of Wales when the time comes: who knows, it might even be a warning.Though even the most enthusiastic of William\u0027s supporters would admit that the 36-year-old heir in line is more likely to model himself on his inscrutable grandmother than on his outspoken father.Indeed, in a candid aside William, who has not always had an easy relationship with Charles, says: \u0027I want to be my own man and take my own style.\u0027As for the future, Charles is unequivocal. Without mentioning the word king, he says: \u0027Clearly I won\u0027t be able to do the same things I\u0027ve done as heir.\u0027He cites Shakespeare as illustration: \u0027You only have to look at Henry V or Henry IV Part I and 2 to see the change that can take place, because if you become the sovereign you play the role in the way that it is expected.\u0027Many will no doubt be reassured by such positivity from the prince, especially those alarmed that – on occasions – he does blunder into the political arena. The Queen, of course, has been nothing short of remarkable in observing the convention that royals do not express their views on any area of public life.What this film seems to suggest is that, as the moment of his elevation to the crown grows closer, he is taking these symbolic positions of the monarch more seriously and more thoughtfully.          Prince Charles never does things in haste. He was 32 when he married for the first time, he romanced Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles more than 30 years before marrying her, and he has now waited until the eve of his 70th birthday before letting the world know what sort of king he will beThe picture that also emerges is one of contentment. Only once, in a project which ned a year in the prince\u0027s life did I – a long-time observer of Charles\u0027s princely temperament – get a glimpse of the crotchety prince.It comes during a clip filmed a Birkhall, the prince\u0027s Scottish retreat which he inherited from the Queen Mother. In the gardens there he has planted an arboretum which he refers to as \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027, because he began planting around the time of the birth of his first grandson.He is walking with Camilla in the gardens when she begins to reminisce about the prince\u0027s long-dead Jack Russell, Tigger. The dog was part of his life at the time his marriage to Diana was breaking up and, despite his second wife\u0027s endeavours, he clearly did not want to discuss the pet. All the same, the nervous tics, the fidgeting with cuffs and never knowing what to do with his hands, were largely absent from this warmest of portraits.The relationship with his sons, which has been troubled, seems to have much improved. They are generous in their praise of their father – especially Harry, who talks of the workaholic prince falling asleep at his desk.He mentions his gratitude to his father for walking Meghan down the aisle at his wedding in May. And in a nod to his American wife, not used to late dining, he suggests that in the future his father might eat dinner earlier in the evening.Camilla, of course, is ever present, saying on air the kind of supportive messages that have been such an integral part of their decades-long relationship.Significantly, she discloses that Charles does not fret about the future. Does his destiny weigh heavily on his shoulders, she is asked at one point? \u0027No,\u0027 she responds, \u0027his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come. I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027There is, naturally, no contribution from the Queen. But wouldn\u0027t it have been fascinating to have heard from Prince Philip?This was, in many ways, a clearing of the decks interview, not unlike the decision he took on another birthday a few years ago to correct some long-repeated misconceptions about him. He said it was untrue that he had seven boiled eggs presented to him for breakfast each day, and explained that Camilla still has her own home because she likes to spend time there with her children and grandchildren.This exercise is far more serious – and risky. Will his openness about how he will reign be believed? If he can succeed in persuading critics of that, then it will have been a gamble worth taking."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/07/22/05502C65000007D0-6364743-image-m-11_1541629248652.jpg","title":"Harry says proud Prince Charles stepped walk Meghan aisle","story":"Prince Harry says his father did not hesitate to step in after the Duchess of Sussex’s father pulled out of walking her down the aisle in May          Millions of viewers were left deeply moved as the prince turned to his father and said, ‘Thank you Pa’, as Charles completed the walk down St George’s Chapel at Windsor with Meghan on his arm          When it became clear that Meghan wouldn’t have her reclusive father to support her, Harry went to his‘For him that’s a fantastic opportunity to step up and be that support, and you know he’s our father so of course he’s going to be there for us.

The dog was part of his life at the time his marriage to Diana was breaking up and, despite his second wife’s endeavours, he clearly did not want to discuss the petHe is walking with Camilla in the gardens when she begins to reminisce about the prince’s long-dead Jack Russell, Tigger. The dog was part of his life at the time his marriage to Diana was breaking up and, despite his second wife’s endeavours, he clearly did not want to discuss the pet. All the same, the nervous tics, the fidgeting with cuffs and never knowing what to do with his hands, were largely absent from this warmest of portraits.The relationship with his sons, which has been troubled, seems to have much improved. They are generous in their praise of their father – especially Harry, who talks of the workaholic prince falling asleep at his desk.He mentions his gratitude to his father for walking Meghan down the aisle at his wedding in May. And in a nod to his American wife, not used to late dining, he suggests that in the future his father might eat dinner earlier in the evening.          There is, naturally, no contribution from the Queen. But wouldn’t it have been fascinating to have heard from Prince Philip?Camilla, of course, is ever present, saying on air the kind of supportive messages that have been such an integral part of their decades-long relationship.Significantly, she discloses that Charles does not fret about the future. Does his destiny weigh heavily on his shoulders, she is asked at one point? ‘No,’ she responds, ‘his destiny will come, he’s always known it’s going to come. I don’t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.’There is, naturally, no contribution from the Queen. But wouldn’t it have been fascinating to have heard from Prince Philip?This was, in many ways, a clearing of the decks interview, not unlike the decision he took on another birthday a few years ago to correct some long-repeated misconceptions about him. He said it was untrue that he had seven boiled eggs presented to him for breakfast each day, and explained that Camilla still has her own home because she likes to spend time there with her children and grandchildren.This exercise is far more serious – and risky. Will his openness about how he will reign be believed? If he can succeed in persuading critics of that, then it will have been a gamble worth taking."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/10/4C775A4C00000578-0-image-m-4_1526809732914.jpg","title":"Stormzy says Oxford University turned offer fund two black students","story":"Stormzy wanted to collaborate with Oxford university to put \u0027bright minds\u0027 who cannot afford the fees through their elite degrees - but they refused, he said          The Stormzy scholarships will go to four students over two years.

The rate is similar to the same period in 2017 - but crucially there has been a dramatic fall in the number of openings year-on-year.Compared with 2,342 shops opening their doors in the first six months of last year, there were 1,569 openings between January 1 and June 30.    Gourmet Burger KitchenThe posh burger chain has revealed plans to close 17 of its 85 restaurants after tough competition took a bite out of its performance.

It came after HMRC sought to recover £15 million in unpaid VAT and this finally tipped the company into administration.MaplinOne of the UK\u0027s biggest electronics retailers collapsed into administration on the same day as Toys R Us after talks with buyers failed to secure a sale.

Greater London and the South East were the regions worst hit by closures of chains, followed by the Midlands, the North East and East of England. Wales was the best-performing region, although it still saw a net loss of 22.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said the continued rate of store closures \u0027reflects the new reality that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home\u0027.\u0027The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts,\u0027 she said.          Retail trends: Sales across key sectors in Britain\u0027s retail industry since May 2017, according to BDO.\u0027Openings simply aren\u0027t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across experiential chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven\u0027t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.\u0027Looking ahead, the turmoil facing the sector is unlikely to abate. Store closures already announced in the second half of the year due to administrations and Company Voluntary Arrangements already will further intensify the situation.\u0027Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, told The Guardian: \u0027The pressure on retailers, which is contributing to store closures, will continue unless the government takes decisive action.\u0027          Hard times: Marks \u0026amp Spencer saw its clothing and food sales fall in the first half of the yearHe also called for the Government to address \u0027spiralling business rates for the larger businesses that employ the majority of the UK\u0027s 3.1million retail workers\u0027.High streets minister Jake Berry said: \u0027The Government recognises the challenges facing high streets driven by changing consumer behaviour.\u0027That is why the Budget has high streets at its heart. We have created a £675million fund to help high streets adapt, slashed business rates by a third for the majority of smaller businesses, and are creating a task force guided by Sir John Timpson, one of the UK\u0027s most experienced retailers, to ensure that high streets are adapting for rapid change and are fit for the future.\u0027These measures totalling over £1.5billion show the Government\u0027s determination to make thriving high streets a permanent part of every community in England.\u0027Now share your opinionToys R Us, Maplin, Poundworld and Coast have been among the major fatalities on the high street so far in 2018, while House of Fraser was rescued from administration by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley.Debenhams, Mothercare, Homebase and Carpetright are all closing outlets.

Jamie\u0027s Italian and Prezzo have announced CVAs, while Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Byron are also utilising the arrangements.The BDO report suggested that love-it-or-loathe-it Black Friday on the horizon, many shoppers shunned the high street in October and are holding out for better deals. Online sales growth came in at 10.5 per cent last month, marking the third lowest monthly result since the tracker data was first published in 2010.Including online and in-store sales, like-for-like retail sales grew by 1 per cent last month, the report said.       Footfall in shopping centres was down every week in October, falling by 4.3 per cent in the third week, when many children were off for the school holidays.Retail parks fared slightly better, seeing an increase in footfall for half of the month.Summing up the state of the sector, BDO said: \u0027The critical final quarter of 2018 got off to an ugly start with a very poor performance for bricks-and-mortar and relatively slack growth for nonstore sales in the month of October. \u0027With recent indicators pointing towards consumer confidence decreasing further, marking concerns over personal finances and reluctance on the part of consumers to make major purchases, it will be difficult for retailers to recover in the final months of the year, potentially threatening upcoming promotional dates both in-store and online.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Jim Acosta DID touch intern says Sarah Sanders doubles claim CNN reporter","story":"    Sarah Sanders shared a re-cut video on Twitter that was originally posted by an InfoWars host, opening herself up to criticism over the footage\u0027s alterations          Sanders was pictured Wednesday in the East Room of the White House during the press conference where Acosta tangled with Trump and later found himself banned from the buildingCNN media critic Brian Stelter pressed her on Twitter: \u0027InfoWars personality @PrisonPlanet posted the same video two hours before you did.

In the major documentary to mark his 70th birthday next week, the heir to the throne tackled head-on a number of issues, such as his controversial lobbying.It also featured candid contributions from family including his sons William and Harry and wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.A number of fascinating facts came out about the heir to the throne, such as he is a workaholic, and often falls asleep at midnight with a memo stuck to his head. The Prince of Wales also denied he would be a \u0027meddling\u0027 monarch when he succeeds to the throne.Response from the viewers to the candid portrait of Prince Wales was mostly positive.           Prince William was impressed with his father\u0027s speech in 1970 where he spoke about plastics and the future problems society would have in disposing of them          The heir to the throne - seen with Prince Andrew at a Prince\u0027s Trust event in Surrey in 1998 - said he would ease up on campaigning as king because he is \u0027not stupid\u0027 One user said: \u0027Just watching Prince Charles on BBC One.\u0027What a wonderful chap he is.

The Prince of Wales is described as a \u0027brilliant\u0027 grandfather who will spend hours crawling on the floor and making silly noises with his little granddaughters and grandsonsIn recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed.But his elder son makes clear that he would like to have more \u0027family time\u0027 with his hard-working father.William says: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027m working more heavily on, put it that way. I think he does have time for it, but I would like him to have more time with the children.\u0027Now he\u0027s reached his 70th year it\u0027s a perfect time to consolidate a little bit because, as most families would do, you are worried about having them around and making sure their health\u0027s OK – and he\u0027s the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until he\u0027s 95.\u0027So having more time with him at home would be lovely, and being able to play around with the grandchildren. \u0027Because when he\u0027s there, he\u0027s brilliant. But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027          If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow downCamilla adds: \u0027He will get down on his knees and crawl about with them for hours, you know making funny noises and laughing, and my grandchildren adore him, absolutely adore him. He reads Harry Potter and he can do all the different voices and I think children really appreciate that.\u0027 Aides say Charles could not be prouder to be a grandfather.The prince happily shows the documentary crew an arboretum that he has planted for his eldest grandchild at Birkhall, his Scottish home, which he calls \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027.Referring to his passion for the environment and life-long campaign to highlight the perils of climate change, Harry reveals his father still can\u0027t help \u0027banging the drum\u0027 even when he sits down with his sons to dinner.He tells his brother: \u0027You know how frustrated he gets. But he\u0027s done an amazing job, and without telling us what he should be doing or the direction that we should go in, he\u0027s just let us learn from the nature of the job, learning from him, learning from Mummy.\u0027The programme reveals how Charles would take his sons litter picking when they were on holiday with him.Harry reveals: \u0027He\u0027s a stickler for turning lights off.\u0027And that\u0027s now something that I\u0027m obsessed with as well, which is insane because actually my wife certainly goes \u0027Well why turn the lights off? You know it\u0027s dark\u0027.\u0027I go \u0027We only need one light, we don\u0027t need like six\u0027, and all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he\u0027s making, every single person can do. And I think that is one of the key lessons certainly that I felt that he taught us.\u0027William agrees, adding: \u0027I know I\u0027ve got serious OCD on light switches now which is terrible.\u0027He does life the way that he advocates. He did take to heart the criticism quite a lot when he was younger.\u0027If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down.Harry jokes: \u0027He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night.\u0027And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he\u0027ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.\u0027  The Queen and Prince Charles surrounded by guests on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London during a star-studded concert to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday. Camilla says: \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all\u0027William agrees, saying: \u0027He has amazing personal discipline. So, he has – and it\u0027s frustrated me in the past a lot – he has a routine.\u0027The only way to fit all this stuff in is things have to be compartmentalised. The man never stops.\u0027I mean when we were kids there was bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him. We could barely even get to his desk to say goodnight to him.\u0027The Duchess of Cornwall says she tried to encourage her husband to \u0027pace himself\u0027 but admits he is too driven to take any notice.She smiles ruefully: \u0027My father once said to me, \u0027As you get older, you\u0027ve got to do one thing and that is pace yourself\u0027. And I would love to tell him to pace himself, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not going to happen.\u0027 Charles neatly sums up the way his life has been mapped out before him, with astonishing matter of factness.He says: \u0027When my mama succeeded and became Queen when by grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne at aged four.\u0027And yet his wife says it is a weight he bears lightly.Asked whether the crown is something he often thinks about, Camilla says: \u0027No, I don\u0027t. \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027When she is asked if it is something he talks about, the duchess replies: \u0027Not very much, no. It\u0027s just something that\u0027s going to happen.\u0027Asked to give a message to the prince on his birthday, his sons are quick to reply.Harry laughs: \u0027Please have dinner earlier is my message to him! I would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative. \u0027But with hopefully his children and his grandchildren and hopefully more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u0027William adds: \u0027I\u0027m very pleased that he\u0027s made 70. You know if you ask him if the job\u0027s done, it\u0027s not.\u0027But more than anything I\u0027d like to see his passions and his interests and the things he\u0027s been campaigning for come to fruition completely for him. He hasn\u0027t even reached the point that his natural progression should do – i.e. being monarch. So, you know he\u0027s still got his job to do.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/24/10/5197150800000578-0-image-m-30_1540374618723.jpg","title":"Couple use power tool engrave names national landmark","story":"    Beneath the names \u0027Rach and Tys\u0027 was Saturday\u0027s date, November 3, 2018, meaning the vandals had committed the brazen defacing just days beforehand\u0027Some f***ers have decided to bring a battery-powered angle grinder up here and grind their f***ing names into the rock,\u0027 he said in the video. Beneath the names \u0027Rach and Tys\u0027 was Saturday\u0027s date, November 3, 2018, meaning the vandals had committed the brazen defacing just days before.‘What a low act’: Man leaves huge dent in bonnet of $180K...Hapless vandal tries to kick in the window of a barber\u0027s...Manhunt underway for old man caught spray painting...Remorseless vandal, 29, who defaced memorial to murdered...Share this article\u0027If anyone knows who these d***heads are let me know because I\u0027ll send them a nice little message and maybe pass on their information to parks and wildlife because that is environmental vandalism you f**heads.\u0027\u0027Have a bit of respect for where you are and maybe grow a brain, get f*****.\u0027           Damian \u0027Wildman\u0027 Duffy (pictured) encountered the \u0027environmental vandalism\u0027 on a recent expedition and uploaded a video of himself blasting the move to Facebook The Queensland Department of Environment and Science described the area as a \u0027special meeting place where many Aboriginal people gathered for ceremonies and trading\u0027.\u0027This place is considered spiritually significant with many ceremonial sites still present and protected today,\u0027 it stated on its website. The department said it took such acts of vandalism seriously and called on anyone with information on the culprits to contact them.           The Queensland Department of Environment and Science described the area (pictured) as a \u0027special meeting place where many Aboriginal people gathered for ceremonies and trading\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Moscow square named British double agent Kim Philby","story":"Kim Philby is being honoured in Moscow (PA)Share this articleConsidered Britain’s biggest Cold War traitor, Philby was a senior MI6 officer.

Above, Captain C. N. Taylor is pictured in a mock-up of how the beaches will lookThis was not intended to replace formal ceremonies that will take place at The Cenotaph and war memorials all over the country, but something that could underline the significance of a century and be celebrated alongside them.Rudyard Kipling\u0027s poem, \u0027My Boy Jack\u0027 was written in 1917 in response to the losses in the Battle of Jutland. It also reflects his deeply personal feelings about the disappearance of his son John at the Battle of Loos in 1915: \u0027Have you news of my boy Jack?  Not this tide.\u0027           Captain C. N. Taylor (pictured) served in the Royal Field Artillery, which provided gunnery support for the infantry. It is not known when Captain Taylor diedThe poem has come to represent, for many of us, our own feelings about the millions of unknown soldiers lost to history.Kipling\u0027s tide, and the thought of those men and women who left these shores to serve, made me think of the beaches that surround these islands as a possible space where people could come together and commemorate the century since their fight ended: To say goodbye.The shoreline belongs to everyone, it is a democratic space, where only the sea rules at once a personal and public landscape. And these same beaches are where so many soldiers and service people left from. I liked the idea of people coming together in their own way, or with their local community, to celebrate and commemorate, but without too much formal ceremony.We want to create portraits of some of those who were lost, drawn in the sand between low and high tide. The portraits will be created by specialist sand sculptors as the tide goes out in the morning, and gently erased by the sea as the tide returns.I can think of no more fitting site, for instance, than Folkestone beach, the port through which ten million men and women passed on their way to and from France.Some of them, like the poet Wilfred Owen, did not come back. He swam from Folkestone beach the day before he left for the front for the last time in 1918. So we will draw his portrait there.He, and the other poets, brought the war home in a way that the newspapers and newsreels could not, so — in honour of them — we asked the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, to write a new poem to mark the event. I have brought my daughters up on Duffy\u0027s work and she remains, for me, one of the blazing talents of English poetry.I like to think Wilfred Owen would have been pleased with the simplicity and beauty of what she has written.          The closing line of her poem, \u0027Your faces drowning in the pages of the sea\u0027, has given us the title for this project: \u0027The Pages of the Sea\u0027.So, no speeches, but a simple poem, that can be read silently or aloud, singly or in chorus, on the beach. You can decide how you want to do it.Please join us on Sunday at the Pages of the Sea beaches to fill the shorelines around the UK, and stand together, as we watch the faces of the dead disappear.Our beaches are spaces where time is relevant only in relation to the tide where it\u0027s possible perhaps to imagine standing beside those young expectant folk who cannot imagine what awaits them, and to say a final goodbye and an endless thank you.            SO WHICH WAR HEROES WILL BE HONOURED IN YOUR AREA?1. Sunny Sands, Folkestone, KentLieutenant Wilfred Owen (March 18, 1893 — November 4, 1918)One of Britain\u0027s most celebrated war poets, Wilfred Owen composed nearly all his works from August 1917 to September 1918.

I did all the seasons in Yorkshire and it seems so right to see it in France.

Kids are stuck on their computers. That’s the way the generation is going. I’m giving people what they want.’Let’s unpick that. Propping a cot-age baby in front of the television for a long time is a bad idea, but at least there’s a chance that an adult will pass in and out to exchange an occasional word with the baby, or respond to gurgles and coos of interest at the coloured shapes and noises from the screen.  But the idea grew to provide in-cot, swipeable entertainment right next to the little one’s head at a cost of £2,000 per mahogany ‘Florence’ cribThat’s not the case with iPhones, iPads and tablets, which are already, for many parents, a useful substitute for childcare.According to a survey by the website babies.co.uk, half of parents routinely allow their toddlers to play with their gadgets.Hand one over and your child will disappear for hours into a solitary digital world that requires minimal adult input.There are thousands of apps specifically for children, plus devices including an iPotty — a potty with a holder for a screen, and an iTeddy with a media player built into its chest. There’s even a name — an iPaddy — for the tantrums triggered when it’s time to put them away.We know teenagers spend their lives glued to their phones, and even normally sane adults depend on checking them 80 times a day. But now it’s babies. Alone in a cot with a screen, they may quickly learn to swipe and change the pictures or tunes, but there will be no warm human voice. No touch, no connection with the world in a solid, animal way.          That’s not the case with iPhones, iPads and tablets, which are already, for many parents, a useful substitute for childcare. According to a survey by the website babies.co.uk, half of parents routinely allow their toddlers to play with their gadgetsIt’s reminiscent of those science fiction stories where human bodies atrophy and nothing remains but a brain on a stick.There is a real risk in this. Toddlers can indeed enjoy a bit of tablet time, within limits, and the gadgets are useful for those with physical or learning disabilities. I’ve seen how working with an iPad helped a young child with limited speech who had spent months isolated in hospital while on chemotherapy.But that is the exception. A healthy baby, like any young creature, needs as much stimulation in the world as possible.The more time an infant spends delving into Play-Doh, mud or sand flicking through books playing with paper, crayons and fingerpaints or waving around bits of rope, the better.It is an education in science, aesthetics, even drama — shoving Teddy’s head in the sand and pulling him out again, or pushing a Duplo car off the table so the people fall out is the first bit of imaginative creativity.But, say the digital zealots, isn’t a screen a window on the world? Sure, for a few minutes now and then. But there is a big difference between a picture of a duck and seeing a real one quacking along, tantalisingly almost within reach of your pushchair, or fighting with other ducks for the bits of bread you’ve hurled into the water.And how can even the most exciting Thomas The Tank Engine video compete with the thrillingly noisy cranes and diggers at the building site on the way to the park?This exposure to the sights, sounds and smells of the everyday is a vital part of development. We rightly expressed horror in the Nineties at the reports of Romanian babies confined to their cots all day in bleak orphanages with only perfunctory human contact.          Mr Taylor the cot-man might accept that being stuck to a screen is ‘the way this generation is going’, but alarm bells are ringing on the far side of those teenage yearsWe know what difficulties these children experienced in coping with normal levels of mental stimulation and socialising with others as they grew up.Mr Taylor the cot-man might accept that being stuck to a screen is ‘the way this generation is going’, but alarm bells are ringing on the far side of those teenage years. Roger Kneebone, professor of surgical education at Imperial College London, warned last week that he was coming across medical students who had spent so much time in the swipe-a-screen world that they had no ‘tactile general knowledge’ and weren’t fit to cut and sew as surgeons must. (Imperial is actually hiring magicians to encourage students to make more sophisticated use of their fingers.)There are darker worries, too. Professor Susan Greenfield and others who study the development of the brain have been warning for years about the consequences of addiction to screen games and digital social media.The brain is shaped through life on a physical, cellular level.‘When I say “shaped”, I’m not talking figuratively or metaphorically, I’m talking literally,’ Professor Greenfield explains. ‘At a micro-cellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain change in response to experiences and stimuli.’All kinds of alarming changes are being noticed already. Attention s of young and old are lowered by constant clicking and swiping even adults notice how much more we focus after a few days off email, Twitter and the rest.Professor Greenfield talks of young brains being ‘re-wired’ to meet the needs of this useless click-gratification, to deliver that hit of ‘feel-good’ chemicals in the brain that keep children hooked.Other vital human abilities are lost, too. Adam Alter, author of Irresistible: The Rise Of Addictive Technology, quotes research showing that children who regularly use tablets or phones often lose the natural ability to decode expressions in people’s faces and bodies.Nor is excessive screen time good for our eyes. A report from Toledo University found that the blue light from screens may increase the risk of the eye condition macular degeneration. It’s not an instant alarm call, but we are advised to avert our eyes from our screens every few minutes to focus on something in the distance.As adults we can act on this, but how easy it will be for the colourful, moving images and tunes to hold a baby’s little eyes for too long.Some aspects of life, of course, are enhanced by tech: we all learn from the internet, a cornucopia of facts and images in our pocket, unique in human history.And it is true that video gamers develop a remarkably fast set of reflexes, but it is in a limited range of movement just as that poor baby, alone in a cot, swiping at the screen on the iPad will get quite good at it — but at nothing else.How many parents will be able to convince their children to pick up a book and discover the wonders of classic stories when they’re competing with such a digital box of delights?And since adults are being begged by sleep experts not to take their phones or tablets into the bedroom for the sake of proper rest — blue light blocks release of the sleep hormone melatonin — what are we doing even contemplating settling a child down with one of the things?How can we adults, who grew up without tech interfering in our lives, who are used to solid and social life and know when we need a break, belittle the risk to our children by acquainting them with a screen from their cradle? Less intelligent cot, more digital nanny. It is nothing short of horrifying."},{"url":null,"title":"Baby born board service Stratford station mother unexpectedly goes labour","story":"    Trains heading into Stratford International were delayed after a mother went into labour on a London-bound train Stormzy says Oxford University turned down his offer to fund...Share this articleThe pregnant woman was on a Southeastern train heading into London when she went into labour. Paramedics were called and they rushed to her carriage to deliver her new child. Southeastern\u0027s Twitter account wrote: \u0027London bound Trains are being delayed at Stratford International after an ambulance has been called to a train following the birth of a new baby on board.           The pregnant woman was on a Southeastern train heading into London\u0027s Stratford International (pictured) when she went unexpectedly went into labour\u0027London bound trains are unable to stop at the station until the ambulance arrives.

So we borrowed a farm, put some in masks – and shot them in a cow barn then a pigsty’ This was taken at a time when I was becoming a little jaded about fashion. It’s a commentary on the way I thought some models were treated, right in front of me. I felt they weren’t being treated like people. I had done another project, Breeding, about how models have an almost homogenous look, with everything equal and in particular proportions. So I suppose I was already interested in livestock as a theme.People always call me a fashion photographer, but really I’m a commercial portrait photographer. I’ve never felt I fully belonged in the fashion world, particularly the churning business side of it all. You hear these ridiculous things, like someone saying: “I have to fly this dress on Concorde!” Why would you ever have to fly a dress on Concorde?I had done a version of this already at Kentish Town City Farm in 1993, with the stylist Katie Grand. My studio is just down the road and I’ve got a bit of a soft spot for the farm. For this shot, though, we wanted to make it look very realistic so I ended up borrowing someone’s farm in Dorset. Well, I think the farm was in Dorset. I know it was absolutely miles away.I’m a massive fan of Monty Python and that sort of British comedy. I thought: “Why not do a really funny fashion shoot actually about cows and sheep?” Fashion can be so absurd: I just wanted to put a mirror up to it, do something ridiculous. I knew people would either really like it or be really annoyed by it.It was a fun shoot, but it was uncomfortable for the models. We used a cow barn, a pigsty, and a sheep field. This one is from the barn, where we also set up a white studio. I shot the cow with Polaroids, both sides, to make it look hyperrealistic. But I also used the Mamiya RZ67 I had back then. I do that sometimes: double up on cameras, just in case one approach doesn’t work. There was just something funny and silly about bringing a model on set, then putting hooves and a cow mask on them. It could be anyone under there. I can’t remember who made the jacket – probably someone really important who I’ve now forgotten.I’ve always loved animals. A few years ago, I became a vegetarian. I have three dogs and I take photographs for Battersea Dogs \u0026amp Cats Home. They’re beautiful to photograph. Every year, my wife and I do a dog calendar for the family – pastiching film posters, classic album covers, that kind of thing.I once did a full cat fashion shoot. We had all these outfits made for the cat, based on Prada and Chanel stuff. But the owner had been giving the animal so many treats, it had put on weight and couldn’t fit into any of the clothes. So there it was again, that need to tell a model they’ve put on weight.I don’t want to bite the hand that feeds me. I’m really seduced by fashion and I love the imagery. But I’m interested in humanity. And I see much more of it in that shot.• Unfashionable: 30 Years of Fashion Photography by Rankin is published by Rizzoli (£50).Training: Barnfield college, Luton (BTech), and the London College of Printing (BA, didn’t pass).High point: “Working with Katie Grand and Jefferson Hack, although at the time we wanted to kill each other.”Low point: “When that scene fell apart – it turned into squabbles about who was paying for what.”Top tip: “Listen to Tristan Harris’s interview on the Waking Up podcast with Sam Harris about technology addiction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae86b8d5824bffa3c3c85532fd681a1a5e509bc4/0_193_2253_1351/master/2253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50257561cd5ec804b9f2777a7157f362","title":"nudes maids and the eiffel tower classic french photography in pictures paris photo","story":"The French humanist movement of the 1930s changed photography for good.

All I can hear are shots, shots.”Spiegel’s mother, Róża, and her younger sister, Ariana, survived the war and moved to America. In the 1950s, Schwarzer, who had survived several concentration camps, located them and gave them Renia’s diary. Neither Róża nor Ariana could bring themselves to read it and so the diary lay “dormant”, said Ariana’s daughter Alexandra Bellak, until she decided to send it for translation.“I realised how important it was, not just for me to learn more about my past but also for the world to see how meaningful this diary was,” said Bellak. “It was very moving.It is heart-breaking and heart-wrenching because you know how the story ends, but also her writing is so beautiful. She’s so mature and thoughtful and introspective. You get a sense of a young woman who’s going through puberty, falling in love with her first boyfriend, having little spats with her sister. You see how intelligent she is – she references philosophers and classical musicians and composers, it’s pretty amazing. With the rise of anti-Semitism and nationalism, here and abroad, it’s more timely than ever.”Alexandra and her mother showed the diary to the film-maker Tomasz Magierski, who was so moved he decided to make a film about Renia. Magierski was also instrumental in having the book self-published in Polish. This summer, Ariana also struck a deal with St Martin’s Press to have her sister’s diary published in English, alongside her own story of survival. This week, an extract from the diary was published for the first time in English in the Smithsonian magazine.“Readers will naturally contrast Renia’s diary with Anne Frank’s,” writes journalist Robin Shulman inthe magazine. “Renia was a little older and more sophisticated, writing frequently in poetry as well as in prose. She was also living out in the world instead of in seclusion. Reading such different firsthand accounts reminds us that each of the Holocaust’s millions of victims had a unique and dramatic experience. At a time when the Holocaust has receded so far into the past that even the youngest survivors are elderly, it’s especially powerful to discover a youthful voice like Renia’s, describing the events in real time.”“Why did I decide to start a diary today? Has something important happened?” Spiegel writes in the Smithsonian’s translation, by Anna Blasiak and Marta Dziurosz. “No! I just want a friend. Somebody I can talk to about my everyday worries and joys. Somebody who will feel what I feel, believe what I say and never reveal my secrets.”The diary shows a girl with typical teenage obsessions, whether it is her schoolmates (“the next girl in our row is Belka — fat and stocky like 300 devils”), teachers or first kisses. Filled with poetry, it also reveals a girl desperately missing her mother: at the time, Renia and Ariana were living in in Przemyśl with their grandparents. As war breaks out, Renia describes the creation of the ghetto to which they are confined, and the deportation of members of her community. On 26 June 1941, she writes of “horrible days in the basement” a few days later, she tells her diary of how she will have to start wearing a white armband. “To you I will always remain the same Renia, but to others I’ll become someone inferior: a girl wearing a white armband with a blue star. I will be a Jude.”“Remember this day remember it well,” she wrote on 15 July 1942. “You will tell generations to come. Since 8 o’clock today we have been shut away in the ghetto. I live here now. The world is separated from me and I’m separated from the world.” Leaving the ghetto without a pass, she writes, is “punishable by death”.“Inside, there are only our people, close ones, dear ones. Outside, there are strangers. My soul is so very sad. My heart is seized with terror,” she writes, later appealing for help: “Israel, save us, help us. You’ve kept me safe from bullets and bombs, from grenades. Help me survive! And you, my dear mamma, pray for us today, pray hard. Think about us and may your thoughts be blessed. Mamma! My dearest, one and only, such terrible times are coming. I love you with all my heart. I love you we will be together again.”Her sister, now 87, said that she never saw Renia writing in her diary when they were growing up. “She must have been hiding it,” said Ariana. “She was very kind to me because my mum wasn’t there and my grandma was old, so my sister was kind of my super mum. She was a brilliant girl, the president of her literary club at school. We used to live at my dad’s estate in the country and she loved the birds and the singing, she loved the trees and the wind blowing … I think she had a soul for seeing things very deeply.”Ariana only learned about the diary when Schwarzer arrived with it in America. “He couldn’t have kept it, because his son told us he went to many camps. But he must have given it to someone. He found my mum. He walked in and said, ‘This is Renia’s diary’ and gave it to mum,” she said. “My sister was the love of his life.”Her mother hid it in a safe and, when she died, Ariana didn’t know what to do with it. She left it alone until Alexandra told her “it was worthwhile for the world to know”.She has now read the part of the diary published in the Smithsonian. “I never could read it before,” she said. “I started getting sick. It’s just a terrible story.”• The Diary of Renia Spiegel will be published in 2019 by St Martin’s Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53544487f8e9bcec6e297a564d4f56e68c9910bd/319_189_1784_1071/master/1784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4de03d2cc487eccb56587324302c1b","title":"ms to air low key christmas ad in attempt to drive sales","story":"Cinematic ad ditched in favour of Holly Willoughby, Keith Lemon and focus on low pricesMarks \u0026amp Spencer has eschewed a John Lewis-style blockbuster Christmas ad in favour of a TV and social media campaign starring Celebrity Juice duo Holly Willoughby and Keith Lemon with a sharper focus on its products and prices.Last year the struggling retailer’s ads featured Paddington, but while the ad attracted nearly 7m views on YouTube alone, its Christmas sales were a washout.So instead of blowing this year’s marketing budget on a cinematic ad, M\u0026ampS has decided to spend the cash on airing it.With M\u0026ampS’s female customers typically aged over 50, the presence of Willoughby is part of the retailer’s drive to attract younger female shoppers. In the ad the 37-year-old daytime TV presenter wears a series of outfits including a £35 leopard-print miniskirt and an £89 purple coat.But the big question is whether shoppers will actually be able to buy Willoughby’s outfits. The TV star curates a seasonal collection of her clothing “must-haves”, but some of the autumn picks, such as a £49.50 leopard-print dress, sold out in some sizes within hours, with Steve Rowe, the boss of M\u0026ampS, admitting it was “letting customers down”.However, ahead of the launch of Willoughby’s festive wardrobe choices Ansell said: “We have learned from that and made sure we have got more stock for customers.” The ad features 15 times as much M\u0026ampS product as last year, with Ansell describing it as a more commercial approach designed to drive sales.The crowd-pleasing ad, which airs for the first time on Tuesday, features a guest appearance from the model David Gandy doing the washing-up in a pair of Marigolds, and a homage to Bridget Jones designed to flog its Christmas knitwear.Keith Lemon, the irreverent alter ego of comedian Leigh Francis, is also a surprise addition to the festive episode of its Instagram food series, which already features Amanda Holden and Paddy McGuinness.Retailers’ festive commercials kick-start the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is dubbed the “golden quarter”, with £98.8bn expected to be spent at UK shops and online in the last three months of 2018, according to analysts at GlobalData, which is a small increase on last year.While Aldi, Tesco, Boots and Argos have already kicked off their campaigns, Britons are still on tenterhooks ahead of the launch of the main event, the John Lewis ad, which this year is expected to feature Elton John.Waitrose will unveil its advert during Coronation Street on Friday night, with a gimmick that will see the preceding ads fast forwarded to reach its commercial. The ruse is in keeping with its strapline that its food is “too good to wait” for.Visa is also running a Christmas ad for the first time, which, with a cast of nine real shopkeepers, aims to encourage Britons to visit their local high streetAfter reporting its worst foodhall sales for a decade this week, the low-key M\u0026ampS food ads make a virtue of its lower prices and are a departure from the “food porn” commercials of old. However, the campaign got off to a rocky start after the hashtag #MyMarksFave was hijacked by shoppers complaining about poor service in its foodhalls, its high prices and local store closures.“While it has been a year of retail failures, profit warnings and store closures so far, the golden quarter offers retailers the opportunity to gain sales from consumers who are finally ready to prioritise shopping,” said GlobalData analyst Patrick O’Brien.However, he predicted low consumer confidence and confusion over Brexit would hit sales of high-priced gifts, while discount chains would benefit from shoppers looking to save money where they could."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4db016a78353e0738b50a107d95868396e3f828/67_0_4733_2839/master/4733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c18feee93f944f597c8cb602129df71d","title":"trafalgar pyramid a look at an alternative london","story":"These rejected architecture and transport plans give a glimpse of how different the city might have beenLondon has been the focus for some questionable urban design ideas over the years – from remaking Soho as a concrete office complex, to building a wheel-shaped airport that would have squatted over Kings Cross, to straightening the Thames.Working with the rendering agency CG Orange, the developer Barratt Homes has superimposed 3D images of several proposals reported by  Cities over Google Earth images of where they would have stood, and our design team has allowed you to switch back and forth. So here’s your chance to see what London might have looked like had some of these designs made it off the drawing board.An airport on the Thames estuary isn’t as original an idea as Boris Johnson might have you believe. A 1934 plan proposed the Thames itself host a new airport, directly next to the Houses of Parliament in between Westminster and Lambeth bridges. It was to be tall enough to accommodate passing ships and suitable for single-propeller aeroplanes.For its rendering here, the CG Orange agency adapted the original design with a new ramped runway, in order to give planes more time to take off, and a riverside check-in lounge, in addition to the storage (of planes and fuel) that was planned for underneath the runway and elevators in the support pillars.This luxury hotel, designed by the architect CJ Phipps, was open from 1899 to 1940 and originally run by the infamous hotelier César Ritz the head chef was Auguste Escoffier, and it competed with the Savoy (which the pair previously ran) for prestige. In the second world war it was badly damaged by bombs, and was eventually entirely demolished by 1958. The High Commission of New Zealand now stands in its place.In the early 19th century, Sir Frederick William Trench, an MP and soldier, had an idea to commemorate the defeat of the French at the recent Battle of Trafalgar and the earlier Battle of the Nile.His idea? A pyramid at the top end of Whitehall. Blueprints show that it would have been taller than St Paul’s Cathedral, with 22 steps – one for each of the years the English and French had fought in those conflicts. Instead, the land was cleared and a statue of Nelson installed. The dream of a London ziggurat was over.Nearly 50 years ago, with bus use falling and cars clogging up the streets, London briefly toyed with the idea of scrapping many of the buses entirely, and replacing them with (sing it) a monorail … monorail … monorail!Proposed by Brian Waters and endorsed by the Conservative opposition in the GLC, the monorail would have had four large loops. Despite that early political support, the plans was quietly abandoned within a couple of years.After the Great Exhibition of 1851, there were a number of plans for what to do with the structure (originally located in Hyde Park, but subsequently moved to Sydenham, in what is now known as Crystal Palace Park).One idea, rather obtusely, was to build London’s tallest skyscraper: Charles Burton drew up a plan for a 1,000 ft high building, which, given the height of the south London location, would now make it 100ft higher than the Shard. There were to be “vertical railways” (we might now call them elevators) to the summit, and a giant clock halfway up.Sources: Google Maps, Earth and Street View data courtesy of Google"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc594e192fc1183d8d569a0c2aa9d47172d3526/0_227_2788_1673/master/2788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4aff3204b4183a5a2ac42d5e4f7a48","title":"dominic raab britain island ignorance brexit secretary","story":"In July 2016, on the eve of his appointment as secretary of state for Brexit, David Davis predicted that the whole thing would be a doddle. Brussels would cater to Britain’s needs and the prime minister would simultaneously negotiate “a free trade area massively larger than the EU”. Within a year, Davis had changed his tune. It was complicated, he conceded. In June 2017, he told an audience of business leaders that the intricacies of the negotiations “make the Nasa moonshot look quite simple”. In July 2018, Davis resigned.He is not the only gung-ho Eurosceptic to meet a steep learning curve in government. His successor, Dominic Raab, is at a different stage on the journey, but the trajectory looks familiar. His speech to Tory conference this year had the swagger of the Brexit buccaneer who has yet to experience the pitch and roll of open water. “If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious,” he said. He did not specify what aspect of the continental position was, in his eminent opinion, unserious.Last night, at a tech industry event, Raab admitted that his grasp of the detail had been upgraded with some salient facts – such as the importance of the Channel to commerce with Europe. “I hadn’t quite understood the full extent of this,” he said. “But if you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.”It is no longer surprising that people who were once confident that Britain had nothing to lose by leaving the EU neither understood what Brexit meant in practice, nor thought to ask. (That doesn’t make it any less dismal that the rest of us are expected to live with the consequences of their incuriosity.) It turns out that the states of being a Brexit ideologue and of being a responsible minister are not really compatible. Ardent leavers who join the cabinet are soon handed a menu of unpalatable choices. They turn queasy at the diet of sticky, granular detail. It wears them down until they are forced to soften their position, change the subject or quit.Boris Johnson, like Davis, chose the easy route: back to the comfort of moaning from the sidelines. Michael Gove discovered a crusading interest in the fate of plastic in the ocean that apparently excuses him from any duty to explain why promises made by the campaign he fronted will not be delivered. If Andrea Leadsom and Chris Grayling think Brexit has turned out as well as they once thought it would, they aren’t saying so. Liam Fox has had a jolly old time jetting around the world, meeting deputy trade ministers and being told that, yes, there is a free trade agreement to be signed with the UK just as soon as it has sorted out its future status with the EU (or in the case of the US, just as soon as it is prepared to surrender to every one of Donald Trump’s capricious demands). Fox is personally quite loyal to Theresa May, which is a rare thing in the cabinet. Plus, the ministerial car can shield the delicate ego from blows that might otherwise be inflicted by having a non-job.A remain-supporting former cabinet minister once told me of frustration in dealing with pro-leave ministers in the early months of the May government. When presented with technical Brexit-related issues in their departments, the true believers would cry foul, saying obstacles were being blown out of proportion, or that the real problem was a lack of will and the solution was more faith. Thus the ludicrous situation arose where the people most seriously engaged in trying to imagine a way forward – the prime minister and the chancellor – had both voted remain. David Davis was the exception, since his job allowed no ducking of difficult questions. He had to confront facts and, when he resisted, the facts won.Now Raab occupies Davis’s old seat, trying to bring Brexit back from its two-year journey to the moon. Re-entry into reality is proving tricky. The myths and the cocksure rhetoric are burning off on contact with the Earth’s atmosphere. It is possible the whole thing can be brought home in one piece, but also that it breaks apart completely, revealing the fundamental design flaw: this rocket was not designed with a safe landing in mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4256412c081eb4771e470bd8c43ac102dbd72345/0_29_4900_2941/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548483fad874c953c8e15701a1e513e0","title":"britain stressed overworked four day week free market workplace","story":"The champions of free market fundamentalism promised their creed would bring us freedom. But it wasn’t freedom at all: from the lack of secure, affordable housing to growing job insecurity and rising personal debt, the inidual is trapped. Nine decades ago, John Maynard Keynes predicted that technological advances and rising productivity would mean that we’d be working a 15-hour week by now: that target has been somewhat missed. Here is the most pernicious threat to our personal freedom, particularly as the balance of power in the workplace has been shifted so dramatically from worker to boss. A huge portion of our lives involves the surrender of our freedom and personal autonomy. It is time in which we are directed by the needs and whims of others, and denied the right to make our own choices. It is bad for us: it is hardly surprising that over half a million workers suffer from work-related mental health conditions each year, or that 15.4 million working days were lost to work-related stress last year, a jump of nearly a quarter. Yes, there are those who, far from being overworked, actually seek more hours. But a shorter working week would enable us to redistribute hours from the overworked to the underworked. Lord Skidelsky’s inquiry would need to look at cutting the working week without slashing living standards: after all, Britain’s workers have already suffered the worst squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic wars. But cutting the working week would free the inidual, giving millions of workers more time to spend as they see fit. Human freedom should be the core aim of modern socialism. The right to work less would be an act of liberation – and a cause the left should embrace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b724e46eb08392db178c1f4a0bd721f25999280c/531_208_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e3cc34d265791360910ed14830bd70","title":"commercial christmas adverts wrong david lynch nativity","story":"From plagiarism rows to a David Lynch-esque nativity, the ads that have failed to spread seasonal goodwillI don’t know what else to tell you this advert features the actor Jo Hartley, who looks incredibly like Lisa Scott-Lee from Steps, fighting an animated turkey in a boxing ring. Not only should it be the greatest Christmas advert ever, but the best advert of any genre. However, Hartley’s performance was overshadowed by people getting upset (always) over a split-second moment in which a dog is fed some Christmas pudding. To be fair, this is highly irresponsible, because dogs can indeed die from the likes of raisins and chocolate. But it was just a shame, because there was only one thing that this advert should have been remembered for (A LISA SCOTT-LEE LOOKALIKE FIGHTING A TURKEY).So many reasons to be thankful for … not living in America at this time. But it was also well avoided in 2016, to be spared from the supermarket chain Kmart’s Christmas ad, in which six male models in metallic boxers thrusted their private puddings to the tune of Jingle Bells (jingle balls?). Nobody wants to see that. I mean honestly, no one.Moz the Monster is one of the better John Lewis adverts, and yet, it ended so unsatisfactorily. Sure, Moz grows too big to stay under the bed, but then … where does he go? The kid gets a new bedside light that projects stars on to his ceiling … HOW IS THIS AN ADEQUATE REPLACEMENT FOR MOZ? None of this is ever explained. The advert was very popular, leading to #MozTheMonster trending on Twitter for days, but it also courted controversy when it was pointed out that Moz was suspiciously similar to well-known children’s author Chris Riddell’s creation in his book, Mr Underbed. Barely any of this had anything to do with Christmas, mind.Asda managed to piss off everyone with its 2012 campaign. Tag line: “Behind every great Christmas, there’s a mum. And behind every mum, there’s Asda.” Women were annoyed at the idea that they should do all of the work, and men fumed at their portrayal as lazy and unhelpful. More than 600 people saw fit to complain to the Advertising Standards Authority on the grounds of casual sexism, but the ad was cleared of fault. Still, it was a bit too late for Asda, having already taken the hit. Especially given that the ad’s final line was a husband asking, “What’s for tea, love?”Look, as soon as you have a small child singing: “I leave a wet spot on your knee”, while sitting on the lap of a man dressed as Santa Claus, you’re in trouble. And that’s before the depressing contemplation of eating KFC for Christmas lunch.This has been called the worst Christmas advert of all time. And, yet, I might be the only person to fully appreciate it. It’s a Christmas advert, but as if written by Julia Davis and directed by David Lynch. The scene is a nativity play, with the woman playing Mary actually giving birth in real time as a horrified audience watch on. The advert was shown on television just three times, and resulted in the most complaints the Advertising Standards Authority had ever received. And if you are wondering what the connection is to Mr Kipling’s cakes … I have no idea. I’m not sure the execs did either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

Check out kitsch memorabilia, clothing with Chinese motifs, and Hong Kong-made backpacks In the narrow, lantern-filled streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) – under looming mirrored skyscrapers and a hot tropical sun – Hong Kong becomes a city dedicated to eating and shopping. Visitors on a consumption high lurch from buzzing dim sum restaurants to bustling markets, gorging on truffle wontons and debating exactly how often they’d use a 10-part porcelain tea set back home. Of the hundreds of Cantonese restaurants, aromatic medicine shops and colourful boutiques stocked with local goods that line the city’s streets, the following examples in particular capture the essence of Hong Kong with aplomb.Ho Lee Fook Directly translating as “good fortune in your mouth” in English, the name of this colourful Cantonese restaurant sounds a lot like the exclamation diners make after tasting the tender roast wagyu short ribs with soy glaze, the Taiwanese chicken or the threadfin fish with Jamaican-Chinese jerk rub. The Hong Kong theme is strong throughout – think a giant shimmering bronze dragon covering one wall, while the steps leading down to the restaurant are lined with hundreds of golden toy cats raising a single paw in salute. It’s no reservations, so avoid prime time – or factor in a few strong cocktails at the bar while you wait.Jimmy’s KitchenIf only walls could talk. Jimmy’s Kitchen has been around since 1928 and has been serving western food to celebrities, politicians and particularly homesick expats for nearly a century. Today, this icon from the colonial era is packed every night with locals who come to immerse themselves in the nostalgic decor and delightfully old-fashioned attitude to food. Popular with megastars like Cary Grant and John Wayne back in the day, its menu has barely been updated since the 1950s – think steak and kidney pie and baked pork knuckle.

It’s not a question of sacrifice, but deliciousness“How does it taste?” says Dan Barber, regarding me expectantly in the garden of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, his restaurant in the Hudson Valley just north of New York. I am gnawing the crust of a large piece of bread that has been grown from Barber Wheat, a hybrid seed developed by Barber and his partners to be nutrient dense, high in yield and – a radical thought in seed breeding, apparently – full of flavour. (Whereas clapped out old seeds might yield 30 bushels an acre, Barber Wheat will stretch to 95). The bread is simultaneously light, and dense, and intricate in flavour in such a way that I can’t think of a single word to do it justice. Barber, who at 49 has the manic energy of someone for whom no plate of food will ever live up to the ideal in his head, looks at me gloomily. “That’s the whole problem with food writing,” he says.There are bigger problems in the food world. With the possible exception of “financial regulation”, there can be few more deadly phrases to the casual reader than “sustainable agriculture”, a heavy-weather issue most of us recognise as increasingly important but nonetheless killingly dull. This is where Barber, who set up his restaurant in 2004, is hugely persuasive, a charismatic leader who, if you talk to him for an hour while walking around the kitchen and bucolic surroundings of Stone Barns, will have you genuinely excited about crop rotation, and soil conditions, and the fact that the food industry is a dying behemoth reliant on low-yield, agronomically risky seeds that produce ever more tasteless and nutrition-less food.“There’s never been a time where there’s been such a wholesale decline in frozen processed food,” he says. “Ever. The only units of those companies that are actually increasing market share are prepared vegetables that are not processed.” Which isn’t to say we are all rushing into the open arms of the nearest farmer’s market, although it is Barber’s mission, through his restaurants, to change this.Blue Hill, often cited as Obama’s “favourite restaurant” and with a branch in Manhattan, serves audaciously un-gussied up food that relies almost entirely for its flavour on its extraordinary provenance, from seeds bred by Barber’s seed company, Row 7, or from nearby farms committed to the best soil practices. The phrase “farm-to-table” has become something of a target in the last few years, “dismissed as pretentious and idiotic” as Barber says, and redolent of smug city dwellers fawning over a tomato. The chef prefers the terms “local” – “you can’t co-opt ‘local’ I mean, someone will figure out how, but it’s pretty hard” – or “seed-to-table”, since if the seed is no good, he says, everything that follows will be compromisedThe problem for Barber is not one of product, but perception many of us expect healthy eating to entail a large dose of sacrifice. This is wrong, says Barber food grown in nutrient-dense soil simply tastes better. “The change agent is deliciousness and hedonism. In many ways I think that’s why the good food movement, or farm-to-table, has had such legs: it’s rooted in hedonism. What movement can you speak about where it asks you to be greedy? Look at the environmental movement: give up everything. Or religion. The food movement is about something that Americans are really good at.”Eating? “Well, pleasure. We’re actually really not good at eating. But to the extent to which we can change culture through hedonism, I think there’s a real art to that. It’s just hard for Americans who come from the puritan idea that everything that’s virtuous requires sacrifice. It’s hard to talk about these serious issues in the context of pleasure and delight.”The flip side of this is that when Americans find something they do like or believe to be good for them, they can have trouble organising a proportionate response. I tell Barber I went through a brief phase of believing that chia seeds would save me.“Me too,” he says. “I went through the chia phase.”I am currently in the sheets-of-seaweed phase, although I’ve read that in high volumes it might be carcinogenic. He rolls his eyes.The main advantage of US food culture is that it is extremely light on its feet. “Who else is nimble?” says Barber. “Japan, France? Italy?” He laughs. “To introduce a new idea in those cultures? It’s impossible. But we do this.”There are some startling examples of popular products that effectively took off overnight after having been introduced by chefs at the top. “Look at Greek yogurt,” says Barber. “That came from chefs who were looking for a richer taste. Or look at quinoa, or sushi. All of these things that have become mainstream, started up high. Twenty years from now you’re going to be eating fast food crickets, or whatever it is.”Or, says Barber, “think about coffee. Fresh milk coffee: when I was growing up, you had it in a can, you would never pay $6 for a cup of coffee. But that started with a delicious cup of coffee yes, there are a lot of other reasons for its success, but it was based on just the fact that once you tasted a deliciously fresh, brewed cup of coffee, no one would go back. And that happened overnight, and it’s the same with Greek yogurt.”One of the problems with this kind of rapid uptake in otherwise beneficial produce, is waste. The Greek yoghurt boom has created an effective whey lake, the yogurt by-product that “in large amounts becomes very toxic. What do you do with all this whey? If you were in a different culture, you didn’t waste the whey. You had your greek yogurt, marinated your lamb that used up the whey, and that’s the cuisine. But in America we don’t have that.”In the case of quinoa, “now indigenous farmers in South America can’t afford quinoa because the price has gone up so much. It has driven thousands of farmers off the land.”The organic food movement entails a lot of waste as farmers rotate crops to rejuvenate the soil, “but since there’s no market for the other crops, they throw it into bag feed and lose money. That’s insane. That’s why organic food is so expensive. If you want to democratise the food system, you should be eating the ersity – the lowly soil supporting crops that organic farmers are forced into buying.”It’s a question, says Barber, of “who’s advocating for the ryes and the barleys and the millets?” That is where the job of the chef comes in and much of Barber’s time is spent doing what feels like a series of maths problems: how to create delicious food from ostensible waste products that support the crop rotation necessary to rejuvenate the soil. Only the chef can do this, he says obviously the supermarkets won’t.“Restaurants can become these cathedrals of ideas. Back in the day, traditional cuisines did that for food. They figured it out and passed it on, so that you ate certain things at certain times of the year. We were just never forced into those negotiations, because we were so plentiful. We came over here and it was like the garden of Eden.”The point is, says Barber, that joining the dots between products is what he’s there to do, “and that’s where the pattern of cuisine becomes so instrumental. And who puts those pieces together? That’s when it comes back to the restaurants. At a restaurant you’re like a conductor in an orchestra. You’re putting the stuff together in ways that nobody else can, or will.”The night after our conversation and back in New York, I visit Barber’s city branch of Blue Hill and taste many of the things I saw him discussing with his kitchen staff the day before, using all the sustainable methods he spoke of: raw beets sliced wafer thin and marbled with purple veins spear-harvested black fish mushroom “nuggets” that taste better than chicken. There’s no point in trying to describe this stuff. But taste it, and you’ll never turn back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2afd20f92fab9c7ca374e0aba5dfb8764d632ed7/1441_313_1571_943/master/1571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d51eca2d33d342d8bdd62db3adab356c","title":"dancing queen hygge fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekThe Little Drummer Girl Espesh Florence Pugh, who is filling the glamsel-in-a-dress hole left by Killing Eve.Clogs Vogue has coined them “the bookworm’s shoe”.

It varies in its blend of spices, but those that make the most regular appearance are a turmeric mix, which I stir into frothed hot milk, a panch phoran – whole mustard, fenugreek and fennel seeds – to temper (toast and top) curries, and this Sri Lankan blend with roasted rice, black pepper and clove. It’s the one I come back to in colder months: it is warming, fragrant and uplifting all at once.This curry powder uses toasted rice as a base, which adds a buttery, nutty note and works well with the warming spices. The recipe makes enough for quite a few curries, and will keep for up to two months. If you don’t think you will use it that quickly, I suggest halving it. As the spices are already toasted here, this works really well sprinkled over warm, buttered chapatis or naans, or on top of yoghurt, raita or even mashed avocado.2 tbsp basmati rice2 whole kashmiri dried chillies or ½ tsp dried red chilli4 tbsp coriander seeds3 tbsp cumin seeds2 tbsp black peppercorns1 tbsp black mustard seeds1 tsp whole cloves1 heaped tsp cardamom seeds (from the pods)2 heaped tsp fennel seedsZest of 2 unwaxed lemonsPut the rice in a dry nonstick large pan and put over a medium heat until it starts to turn light brown.Add the spices and dried chilli and toast for three minutes, until they also start to brown, toast and become aromatic.Keep moving the pan to prevent the spices from burning. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon zest, then leave to cool.Once cooled, use a spice grinder (or a pestle and mortar) to grind them into a powder and keep in an airtight jar for later.A dark, intensely flavoured curry freshened by chard and lemons. It might seem strange to use preserved lemon in a curry, but I enjoyed salted lemons in Sri Lanka. If you don’t have preserved lemon, then a whole lemon sliced thin and salted with half a teaspoon of sea salt will stand in. If you don’t have the time or inclination to make the curry powder, use a shop-bought garam masala, adding an extra half-teaspoon of ground cloves, a tablespoon of mustard seeds and the zest of a lemon.3 tbsp coconut oil or ghee 3 onions, peeled and finely sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced 1 large thumb fresh ginger, peeled and grated 600g small potatoes2 whole preserved lemons, roughly chopped ½ tbsp Sri Lankan curry powder (see  above)400ml (1 tin) coconut milk400ml (1 tin)  tomatoes 250g chard 1 lemonRotis or chapatis and rice, to serveFor the cashews 100g cashew nuts ½ tsp dried kashmiri chilli or a pinch of dried chilli ½ tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp maple syrupPut a large, heavy-based pan over a medium heat, add two tablespoons of the oil and the onions, and cook until soft, sticky and sweet – 15-20 minutes.Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another couple of minutes over a high heat, then add the potatoes, preserved lemons and curry powder, and cook for another three to four minutes, stirring all the time.Add the coconut milk and the tinned tomatoes, and simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on, stirring every now and again.While the curry is simmering, toast the cashews in a frying pan over a medium heat until golden, toss in the spices and toast for 30 seconds more. Turn off the heat, add the maple syrup and salt, and scoop on to a plate for serving.Pull the chard leaves off the stems, tear the leaves into large bite-sized pieces and finely chop the stalks. Once the curry has had 20 minutes, add the chard and the stalks, and cook for a final 10 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through.Serve the curry with warm bread and rice, and top with crunchy cashews and a good squeeze of lemon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5aa949ea02a1a58d78c5a43f7833f149ac5aefa/71_0_1567_940/master/1567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4adb9bae215d1a8365ed827ae02b90","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool judged manchester city title premier league","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool’s season should not be judged solely on winning the Premier League and feels his team deserve more credit than has been bestowed so far.Liverpool can equal their highest points tally after 12 games of a Premier League season with victory over Fulham on Sunday and another clean sheet would deliver the lowest tally of goals conceded – five – at the same stage.Klopp accepts expectations are higher this season having reached the Champions League final in May and out-spent every other Premier League club in the summer transfer window. However, he believes a return of 27 points from a possible 33 has not generated the positivity it merits because of the absence of last season’s flowing football and the form of title rivals.The Liverpool manager, who led the inquest into Tuesday’s Champions League defeat at Red Star Belgrade on the return to Melwood the following day, said: “It was more a general meeting about our situation and what we expect from ourselves. The season so far, point-wise, is really successful but it doesn’t feel like that for two reasons: the comparison with last year and the free-flowing football, and Man City, Chelsea and the others who are playing a very good season as well.Klopp insists Liverpool have shown undoubted improvement this season, with the exception of the performances at Red Star and Napoli, without rediscovering the attacking flair of the last campaign.“Everybody is searching for it,” he added. “All the different expectations are on the boys. We were in the Champions League final last year, and for the first 25 minutes we were the better team in the final. Doesn’t help a lot but that’s the last impression people have.“We have to start again, and the other teams don’t get worse. A little moan about the situation is great but we are really ambitious. Whatever we can get, we want to take with all we have, but it’s a different situation – Champions League final, new signings settling in, it sounds like you automatically win the Champions League or the league. But the other teams don’t sleep.“We have to see it in the right way, be positive and not the other way round. It’s like we win a game and we have to say sorry for not winning it in a City way or whatever. I get that, we have space for improvement, but there is no reason for any negative view.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b353752179947371c7f6ea5d48c6b1b66956b6ed/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24d175ec484b9a0c263753bcf35add0","title":"premier league top five bottom five great divide","story":"The top five clubs have played the bottom five 19 times this season and won every one. There is nothing to celebrate in the top flight’s great ideAmid all the gloom enveloping those at the wrong end of the Premier League table, where Fulham, Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle and Southampton have conceded 108 goals between them, suffered 36 defeats and registered only one victory each, there is a ray of hope. On the basis of the results so far, only 22 points will be needed to stay up this season.Although 11 fixtures is not much of a sample size from which to calculate a points-per-game ratio, the numbers do not lie and there is no getting away from just how poor the standard is in the lower reaches of the Premier League this season. The fact that this is the first time in 27 Premier League seasons that five clubs have seven or fewer points from their opening 11 matches says it all.Newcastle, who won last Saturday for the first time this season, are somehow out of the relegation zone despite picking up only six points from 11 games. The survival bar could hardly be set any lower and it all feels so predictable. Cast the net a little further to include Burnley, who are lying in 15th place, and a strong case could be made to say that the bottom six now will be the bottom six come May, with only their order to be decided.A glance towards the other end of the table shows how the other half live. Manchester City, the leaders, have as many points as Fulham, Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle and Southampton – a quarter of the clubs – put together. By way of comparison, the bottom five had 10 points more than the league leaders at the same juncture last season – and Pep Guardiola’s team, who were also top then, were two points better off than they are now.The numbers say much about what the Premier League has become this season, with one set of results in particular highlighting the growing ide that makes a mockery of the idea that English football’s top flight should be celebrated for its competitiveness.Fulham, Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle and Southampton have faced Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal – the top five – a total of 19 times this season. The record of the bottom five clubs in those matches reads: P19 W0 D0 L19 F12 A60. To put it bluntly, what is the point of those fixtures? What is clear is that the misery at the bottom cannot be seen in isolation from the joy at the top, where the big boys are racking up points like never before.This is the first time in the Premier League era that three clubs – Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool – are still unbeaten after 11 games. Never before have five Premier League clubs had 23 points or more at this stage.Reeling off all the facts and figures is one thing trying to make sense of them is quite another. The obvious conclusion to draw initially is that the top clubs are getting better and the bottom five, collectively, are as bad as we have ever seen. That, however, seems a little simplistic and is almost certainly not true.For a start, are Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal really that brilliant? The Champions League this season suggests otherwise. Lyon, fourth in Ligue 1, beat Manchester City. Red Star Belgrade, who are hardly a European powerhouse, and Napoli, third in Serie A, defeated Liverpool, while Spurs’ hopes of reaching the knockout stage are hanging by a thread.All of which throws the spotlight back on to the Premier League and specifically what is happening outside of the top five, or the top six as the case will soon be when Manchester United, one place behind high-flying Bournemouth, get their act together domestically. In the past couple of years there has been a movement towards a two-tier league in which mid-table has almost ceased to exist, yet that is definitely not the case this season, with Brighton, Wolves, Leicester, Everton and Watford already comfortably clear (eight to 13 points) of the bottom four and, realistically, not going to seriously threaten the monopoly of the big six.The notable shift this season has taken place lower down, where a group of clubs are in danger of being cut adrift even before the leaves have finished falling from the trees, with their plight so desperate that league victories in November are celebrated like winning cup finals in May. They are playing survival football with 27 matches remaining.In the case of Cardiff, who punched above their weight to win promotion, and Huddersfield, who did the same to retain their Premier League status last season, it is no real surprise to see them in the bottom three. Fulham, however, expected better than to be propping up the league after spending £100m in the summer and it says little for Slavisa Jokanovic’s team that the only victories Cardiff and Huddersfield have managed this season have come at their expense.As for the others, the writing has been on the wall for some time at Southampton, who avoided the drop by the skin of their teeth last season, and Newcastle’s woes feel just as predictable on the back of a summer of discontent and under-investment. Burnley and Crystal Palace are not much better off and in many years would have found themselves in the bottom three with eight points from 11 games.This, however, is unlike any other Premier League season and there is not much to celebrate about that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8422d0658cc9cc49fef59eee85a20d8d33d88c96/0_207_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2056da6667dc39fceddf223346d585e","title":"manchester derby sheffield derby fa cup football countdown live","story":"If you’re off to a game this weekend, by the way, we’d love to know – what is is, where is it, why are you pumped for it?Southampton, of course, face Watford at home tomorrow.

It’s also FA Cup first round weekend. Haringey Borough take on AFC Wimbledon on Friday evening to kick things off and the weekend is full of non-league minnows – your Bromleys, your Dovers, your politan Polices – looking to put one over on the (relatively) big boys.

Then she joined a climbing group, braving frostbite and the Taliban to strike a blow for gender equalityIn a quiet corner of Kabul, a dozen young women welcome their friend back from the summit of Afghanistan’s highest mountain. Like many Afghan women, Hanifa Yousoufi had always been made to believe, growing up, that she shouldn’t go to school or play sport. Yet the 24-year-old has become the first Afghan woman to climb Mount Noshaq.The young women gathered here are among the 70-strong cohort meeting six days a week to learn the art of climbing, something many never imagined they would have a chance to do. Yousoufi explains that because her family are illiterate, there was no encouragement for her to get an education. Instead, she worked as a cleaner to help support the family.“I used to watch other girls in their school uniforms going to school, and I wanted to go,” she says. “But I would just think: ‘No Hanifa, you are not clever like them. Even if you tried, you are not on their level.’ But also, I wanted to stay home and support my family and for my father to feel better about life – he was always working.”A friend introduced Yousoufi to Ascend Afghanistan, run by US organisation Ascend Athletics. When she joined the group in 2016, she had never heard of a crampon – or even attempted a sit-up. Yet in 2017 she ran a marathon, and after months of training she became part of a small team preparing to tackle Noshaq.Climbing in Afghanistan is risky, not just because of the dangers involved but because active insurgency is still a constant threat. The day before the team set off, the Taliban launched an attack nearby, almost scuttling the attempt.“I was nervous because of the fighting so close by,” recalls Yousoufi, who suffered frostbite in one of her toes and altitude sickness during the expedition. “I was so tired and didn’t think I would be able to make it down. But I was so determined.”The programme was founded in 2015 by Marina LeGree, who had previously worked for development organisations in Afghanistan for several years, and was employed by Nato at the height of the war. LeGree explains that witnessing the relentlessly disparaging way in which Afghan women are treated by men was the impetus for a programme that targets empowerment through mountaineering and leadership training.“I just thought we need to have some bad-ass women who can shut people up a little bit,” says LeGree. “At the time I was developing the idea for the programme, I was living in Kabul and would often go and play basketball with the Afghan women’s basketball team. They faced danger getting to and from the gym because of the civil unrest, were ridiculed by all the boys, and then had to deal with comments about what they looked like from the security guards. “This is symbolic of what women face every day in Afghanistan ridicule and constant harassment, but always expected to deliver. It made me want to … help them do things that most men couldn’t do.”In 2015 the first group of women to attend the programme, aged between 15 and 22, completed a 17-day trek taking in three of the region’s highest peaks, all over 4,876m. They named one unclimbed mountain Daughters of the Afghan Lion peak. The girls all look up to project coordinator Freshta Ibrahimi, says LeGree. Coming from an illiterate family, Ibrahimi has experienced extreme poverty and understands the challenges the girls go through from bitter personal experience.In 2016, while a student at Kabul’s American University of Afghanistan, Ibrahimi and her friend were only a few metres away from two attackers who stormed the campus with guns and explosives. Twelve people were killed in the attack, Ibrahimi’s friend among them. “The girls have to deal with so much on a daily basis,” says LeGree. “We are lucky none of our girls have been hurt, but every time there’s an attack it hits close. Someone always knows someone who’s been there.”Yousoufi trekked to base camp with Ibrahimi, as well as another teammate and two guides, including Norwegian Vibeke Sefland, who reached the summit with her. For Yousoufi, the trek was as much about striking a blow for gender equality in a society dominated by men as it was about scaling the second highest mountain in the Hindu Kush.“Climbing Noshaq was much harder than the other mountains I’d climbed,” she says. “But I kept telling myself that finally this was the moment an Afghan girl was going to make it to the top.“I did this for every single girl. The girls of Afghanistan are strong and will continue to be strong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b9c03017f37cf5ae4abb6e10f1b8b1883dbc9d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=033fdcb54cea5cd77db99e2bbf13e4bb","title":"have you already finished your christmas shopping","story":"One in five people in the UK get their Christmas present shopping done before December starts.

And the answers aren’t comforting ‘Well, this is weird, isn’t it?” says Damon Albarn. Six days ago, he was in Mexico City, playing with Gorillaz. Now, he and his bandmates in the Good, the Bad \u0026amp the Queen are in Kent, taking turns to explain their second album in a fake American diner adjacent to the Maidstone studio where they will be performing on Later … with Jools Holland.The seats are regulation red leatherette, and there are pictures on the wall of Stevie Wonder circa 1980’s Hotter Than July, a Ford truck and a Route 66 sign. And under glaring lights, as he picks at a vegetarian dinner in a polystyrene box, Albarn is talking about things that feel as if they have no place here at all: English folk myths the north of England’s coastal resorts his family’s background in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire – and, more than anything, Brexit. Harking back almost 25 years, he describes the new album as “the next instalment of Parklife. Like Parklife is a world, this is another world. Not entirely the real world, but not entirely far off it.”Merrie Land comes nearly 12 years after its predecessor. Like that record, this one was created by Albarn, former Clash bassist Paul Simonon, the trailblazing Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and guitaristkeyboard player Simon Tong (late of the Verve). After that, the similarities end. As if to illustrate the kind of openness and ersity that Albarn thinks Brexit might imperil, the new album has a broader musical palette. Not for nothing has Simonon described Merrie Land as a work of “modern English folk music with a bit of rub-a-dub in it”.“This time around, people can dance,” says Allen, a youthful 78, with the easy confidence that comes from having made breathtakingly original music since the 1960s. “Even without getting up, they can still have their body moving to the music. Everything is in there. With the first record, people asked me: ‘Tony Allen – what the fuck are you doing on this album? We don’t hear you.’ This time around, nobody’s going to ask me that. They can hear me on every track.”The biggest shift, though, is in the album’s theme. The first record portrayed the murky, bohemian parts of Albarn and Simonon’s west London home turf. To evoke the contorted confusion of Brexit, Merrie Land widens its focus beyond the capital and has an even sharper sense of place. There are moments when Albarn suspends his usual fondness for dealing in mood and texture, rather than lyrical specifics, and clearly speaks his mind.The title track is a perfect example, featuring more pointedly political lyrics than Albarn has ever previously written. One of its most plainspoken passages questions the strange alliance between a swathe of working-class Brexit voters and the privately educated opportunists who style themselves as their leaders: “You were the ones who work together  Put the money in the pockets  Of the few and their fortunes  Who crowd the school benches  And jeer at us all because they don’t care about us  They are graceless and you shouldn’t be with them.”“But this” – he means Brexit – “is wrong. Jacob Rees-Mogg and people in Blackpool should never be together. Unless Jacob Rees-Mogg is prepared to go to Blackpool on a Saturday night and have a fucking great time.”The referendum result arrived a few hours before Albarn and the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians were set to perform at Glastonbury 2016. “We had this great performance ready and none of the Syrians could really understand why a lot of us were so upset and shocked,” he says. “If I’d had any idea that we were going to act as a people in the way that we have – prior and post – I would definitely have come back a lot earlier, if you know what I mean. As a person who loves their country, I would have expressed a very strong opinion. In public.”“So I would imagine there were quite a few people who were surprised. It was very strange. Strange times. And from that point onwards, I’ve been thinking about how to express how I feel about it all.”Albarn, Simonon and Tong spent a week there working on new material in January 2017. The album was going to focus on Blackpool, but its scope widened when Albarn began an on-off odyssey around the country, fitted in between two years of touring with Gorillaz. “I was observing,” he says. “Watching, listening. Just taking it all in, like a fine wine,” he laughs. “I went to St Albans. I went to Banbury, Oxford and Luton. Liverpool, Southend. I just walked around – had a cup of tea somewhere, or went to a pub. I wasn’t interviewing people: I was on these quiet, meditative pilgrimages to towns I’d never been to, to learn more about where I came from.”The music they wrote suggests no end of ghosts: off-key pub pianos, bass recorders, an abundance of old-school organ that instantly evokes the British seaside. A song called Lady Boston has the most vivid sense of place, pushing the record out of England and into Wales. It was inspired by Albarn’s visit to Penrhyn castle, near Bangor, a Victorian stately home built using the inherited proceeds from slavery in Jamaica. The band returned there to record the finished song, which has a Welsh-language refrain sung by the Penrhyn male voice choir: “Dwi wrth dy gefn”, which roughly translates as, “I’ve got your back.”“It has a sense of, ‘We rely on each other’,” says Albarn. “We live on this stroppy little island, and we need to talk to each other. But have we not just spent the last couple of years going round in circles? As Danny Dyer said, it’s a mad riddle. Or you could say it’s an Anglo-Saxistentialist crisis.”He returns to Blackpool, or somewhere like it. “That’s why we have all those piers. That’s a kind of metaphor for trying to reach out into the world.”For Simonon, Brexit fits awkwardly with his family background, which lies variously in the Belgian city of Liège, Nice and Whitby – and lots of the popular instincts that fed into the referendum result sit at odds with the band with which he cut his teeth. In the Clash documentary Westway to the World, made 18 years ago, Joe Strummer offered a boiled-down version of what they stood for: “We weren’t little Englanders. At least we had the suss to embrace what we were presented with: the world in all its weird varieties.”“That was a while ago, wasn’t it?” says Simonon, with a grim laugh. “People have grown up – or forgotten. I said to somebody recently: ‘If it wasn’t for the refugees, or immigrants, or people coming over here to work by invitation, there’d be a strong element of the Clash that wouldn’t have existed.’ This album is called Merrie Land, which kind of alludes to people’s nostalgic, sentimental vision of how England used to be. And it never really existed.”So, as the hour of Brexit approaches, what should we do? When I ask Albarn how he feels about a second referendum, he says that “the question wasn’t right in the first place. It should have been: ‘Who are we, and who do we want to become?’ We’ve started to have that conversation. It’s complicated, but there are no easy answers.” He says he will vote Labour at the next election, “but it doesn’t mean I agree with everything they stand for. I’d vote to keep the maximum dialogue possible with our neighbours.”And a little later, he offers this: “On certain days, I just feel like going on to Parliament Square with a handmade placard saying: ‘What are you doing?’ Cos I don’t know what they’re doing. I don’t know why they think this is such a good idea – for the England that I love, and why this is going to be a good thing for us as a culture. It’s King Arthur stuff, really,” he says, and he mimes pulling on a large object. “The placard from the stone! Oh dear …”The key thing is that, in the midst of endless Brexit cacophony, he knows he has something vital to contribute, and if it sits outside the binary language of politics, that’s half the point. “I want to add another voice,” Albarn says. “And I’m going to do it with my music.” He pauses for emphasis. “And with this band.”• Merrie Land is released on Studio 13 on 16 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2599346ccbcf87530020a13b4878433a0b8aa5a6/11_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44266bd09a7ec1fd5c7e73bb9cdd5668","title":"from trio to boygenius in praise of all women supergroups","story":"When famous male musicians unite, it is often a show of strength, while women tend to create space for each others’ talents. So why are there so few bands?There have been few all-women supergroups: by my count, 14 of note, ning 60s R\u0026ampB trio Honey Cone to Boygenius, the trio comprising burgeoning indie talents Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus, who release their debut EP today. It is a comparatively rich era for such allegiances: Boygenius’s existence is mirrored in country by Pistol Annies and in folk by I’m With Her. Even so, the “supergroup” designation can feel like a bad fit for bands comprising noted women musicians.When their male counterparts unite, it’s often in a show of strength that upholds tired rock norms: behold, wearily, the travesty of Hollywood Vampires (Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and Joe Perry). Groups of famous men joining forces often feels like fantasy football – all-star names with no cohesion – whereas for women it’s often more akin to sharing a single easel, creating a space for their talents to complement each other. The young members of Boygenius – named to mock how easily male musicians are lauded as prodigies – found solace in one another as their careers rose in parallel and they encountered the same issues. Miranda Lambert started Pistol Annies to lift up two struggling songwriter friends I’m With Her have remarked on the creative possibilities that exist when they’re not relegated to singing high parts with men.If these creative partnerships are so fruitful for women, why are there so few of them? One answer is that there are simply fewer famous women musicians. Assembling a supergroup requires a precise correlation of career point, sensibility and compatible personality, and those with the stature to be in one have generally powered through an industry even more hostile to women than that of today. Hence why it felt so revelatory when caselangveirs formed in 2016: in their 40s and 50s, Neko Case, kd lang and Laura Veirs turned their hard-won experience into elegant Americana that let them all shine.Another reason is that the scourge of jam-band culture lends itself to these male formations. The handful of noteworthy women supergroups stem from collaboration-oriented genres. The most famous example is Pistol Annies’ predecessors Trio, the Grammy award-winning group of Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris that formed in the mid 70s country music is rooted in the idea of the songwriters’ circle. Riot grrrl was rooted in Olympia, Washington State, and produced a not-insignificant number of super-unions. Many of them included Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownstein and Mary Timony of Helium and Autoclave: they followed 90s duo the Spells with 2010 four-piece Wild Flag, and Timony later formed Ex Hex with some fellow punk lifers.It’s an odd modern phenomenon that when a famous musician dies, fans muse on the heart-warming possibility that they have joined the big jam band in the sky. It’s a depressing end game, really: you spend your career carving out an artistic identity only to be subsumed into death’s eternal racket. When women and non-binary musicians have to fight harder for that recognition, perhaps it makes sense that they wouldn’t give it up so easily. When they do join forces, it tends to be in solidarity rather than a show of strength.Others know that the fantasy is often much more tantalising than the reality of full schedules and uncooperative labels (an issue that stalled Trio’s debut) and any ego payload it might deliver. Björk and PJ Harvey doing (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction at the 1994 Brits suggests a potent alternate reality, as does Dua Lipa performing in Radio 1’s Live Lounge backed by Charli XCX, Zara Larson, MØ and Alma this February. Maybe these mergers are better left as fantasy – although call me when the music that St Vincent and Brownstein made together finally surfaces.Boygenius’s self-titled EP is released today on Matador"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0c680ce896a6d27023dc4eda2592b5dc297266/52_0_3256_4176/master/3256.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c5a417aaadbbb3f91318eaa1cae040 480w","title":"taking on the eu podcast","story":"The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis staked his political career on getting a deal with the European Union – and lost.

Any version of the backstop would apply unless and until a wider UK-EU deal on the future relationship solved the issue of how to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Wilson said: “She is now contemplating signing up to a legal agreement which, regardless to her aspirations, would be binding on the government of the UK. Secondly, it would be a legal agreement which the government of the UK could not walk away from – that could only be broken if the government in the UK and the EU agreed to it being changed.”The leak of the letter is seen by some observers, as well as the DUP, as part of a laying of the ground by the prime minister for a showdown with the party over checks in British ports, or factories in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.Under the EU proposals, UK officials would be “competent authorities” to conduct the checks, but to EU rules, something the DUP has said will cross its red line.However, government sources sought to play down the significance of the leaked letter, urging MPs to wait for the full text of the withdrawal agreement to be published.That could happen within days, if the prime minister wins the backing of the cabinet for her negotiating stance.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The prime minister’s letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories. The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.”The row comes as Brexit is expected to dominate the agenda of the British-Irish Council, which will be attended by the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, David Lidington, who is in effect May’s deputy, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley. The summit on the Isle of Man will also be attended by the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones.Brexit is also expected to be a focal point when May meets the French president for a working lunch after attending armistice commemorations in Belgium and France.Downing Street has played down suggestions that a Brexit deal is imminent, after the European council president, Donald Tusk, appeared to indicate that a breakthrough could come within the next week.Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Conservative MPs said they will still vote down the government’s Brexit agreement, even if May negotiates an exit clause from the Irish backstop.The cabinet has been locked in a bitter internal wrangle about whether, and how, the government could extricate itself from the backstop, with some ministers concerned May’s plans could leave the UK in permanent limbo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e10990665f465b444bb365177ab2d22cdc15586a/0_130_3311_1987/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d306f2699009626ed2f88ef239cf264","title":"john mcdonnell shapes labour case for four day week","story":"Economist Lord Skidelsky working with shadow chancellor on ‘practical possibilities of reducing the working week’John McDonnell, the Labour shadow chancellor, is in discussions with the distinguished economist Lord Skidelsky about an independent inquiry into cutting the working week, possibly from the traditional five days to four.The academic, who has a longstanding interest in the future of work, confirmed he was talking to the shadow chancellor about “the practical possibilities of reducing the working week”.Skidelsky said he did not want to “be too exact” about his recommendations, although he added the idea of exploring ways of reducing the traditional five-day week to four was under consideration.McDonnell has suggested the party could ​include a pledge to reduce the traditional working week by a day in its manifesto for the next election. Asked directly about this last month in a BBC interview, ​he said: “We will see how it goes.”The idea, though, is sensitive in Labour circles with some ​unsure whether such a commitment would be appropriate. The idea was floated during the ​Labour conference in September ​but the party later denied it was being considered – before McDonnell reignited speculation about it in the BBC interview.Labour insiders say that people work too many long hours but some argue that issues such as zero-hour contracts and other issues faced by gig-economy workers are more pressing.Skidelsky indicated he did not anticipate holding an official party inquiry, saying that he hoped to produce work that would be “open to anyone to look at the results”. Workers in France and Germany produce more than their British counterparts, despite working shorter weeks.Further clarity on the topic is expected in around a fortnight. When McDonnell was asked on Tuesday directly about Skidelsky advising him on a four-day week, he said: “I’ll get back to you on that. I’ll let you know in the next couple of weeks”.The shadow chancellor added that he was reading a new book by Skidelsky, entitled Money and Government, describing it as “terrific”.Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said that a four-day week should be “an ambition” at ​its annual gathering in September. At the time Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, responded by saying the idea would do “untold damage to our economy”.Skidelsky, who sits as a crossbencher in the Lords, is an emeritus professor at Warwick University and has previously written a three-volume biography of Lord Keynes as well as on the financial crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8431ec747bbf296ff4a15a31992e00226dc242fa/0_51_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ff3558103fbda301982a8c78afea5e4","title":"politics live readers edition friday 9 november","story":"A forum where readers can discuss today’s politics and share links to breaking news and to the most interesting politics stories, blogs and tweets on the web We’re not writing our usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

The project also found evidence of two previously unknown migrations into South America and revealed surprising traces of Australasian ancestry in indigenous South Americans that hint at a far earlier arrival of modern humans to the Americas – potentially dating back 30,000 years or more.Prof Eske Willerslev, who led the sequencing of the Spirit Cave Mummy and helped interpret genetic data from dozens of ancient specimens ning about 10,000 years and locations from Alaska to Patagonia, said the findings highlighted the “power of ancient DNA” to reveal untold stories of the distant past.Willerslev, who holds positions at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge, attended the reburial of the mummy this summer, which he said involved crying, singing and prayers. The mummy was placed in a casket and people were invited to place farewell gifts alongside it Willerslev added a box of snuff tobacco.“What was most amazing is that it was similar to if you and I were burying a very close relative,” he said. “It’s that emotional even though we are burying a mummy that was living 10,000 years ago.”He said the event challenged claims by some in the scientific community that indigenous groups often fight for repatriation of remains in order to gain a political voice. “This event showed me it’s way more than that, it’s very deep feelings,” he said. “It’s similar to us not being able to bury our grandmother and her skull put on a shelf somewhere.”The analysis, which was carried out with the involvement and consent of the tribe, also debunked a controversial theory that the skeleton was Paleoamerican, based on earlier work suggesting that Native Americans have different shaped skulls.“Looking at the bumps and shapes of a head does not help you understand the true genetic ancestry of a population – we have proved that you can have people who look very different but are closely related,” said Willerslev.The skeleton, an adult male aged around 40 at the time of his death, was wearing moccasins and wrapped in a rabbit-skin blanket and reed mats. His remains were found in 1940, along with the partial remains of three other iniduals.The discovery came as part of a wider investigation that has revealed previously unknown details of what happened after the first American populations erged from their Siberian and East Asian ancestors nearly 25,000 years ago. The latest findings show that people spread rapidly, yet unevenly, throughout the Americas, and included three different streams of people dispersing from North to South America some time before 15,000 years ago.“Nearly all Central and South Americans arose from a star-like radiation of the first lineage into at least three branches,” said Cosimo Posth, a geneticist from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and co-author of one of three scientific papers published by the international team. “With DNA evidence largely based on present-day people, those multiple gene flow events are undetectable, highlighting the power of ancient DNA data.”One migratory stream was linked to the Clovis people, who are linked to archaeological sites in North America from about 13,000 years ago. But this early group of migrants to South America appeared to have been almost entirely replaced by a subsequent wave 9,000 years ago.The study revealed traces of Australasian ancestry in ancient Native Americans in South but not North America. This could be evidence of the existence of an ancient population, with deep ancestral links to people who ended up in Australasia, that arrived in the Americas far earlier than the ancestors of Native Americans.“It really opens the question of whether there has been a much earlier migration into America,” Willerslev said.Victor Moreno-Mayar, from the Centre for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen, and first author of the study, said: “That this signal has not been previously documented in North America implies that an earlier group possessing it had disappeared or a later arriving group passed through North America without leaving any genetic trace.”The findings are published in the journals Science, Science Advances and Cell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bed02fa658fa77852f06b3cae39400c3a52af89/0_84_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40673ccb9052e53dd428c21abf207218","title":"stephen hawkings wheelchair sold at auction","story":"Christie’s sale also includes items belonging to Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert EinsteinStephen Hawking’s wheelchair and a set of his medals and awards have been sold for a combined total of nearly £600,000, while a copy of his PhD thesis raised almost that amount on its own, at an auction of items belonging to him and other celebrated scientists.The sale, run online by Christie’s and including 52 lots, raised more than £1.8m on Thursday. It included items belonging to Hawking, as well as others linked to Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein.The dissertation was expected to sell for up to £150,000 but the buyer eventually bid £584,750 to secure it. Hawking’s motorised wheelchair sold for £296,750, as did the set of seven awards, including the Albert Einstein award for achievement in natural sciences. One of Newton’s manuscripts sold for £100,000, a letter written by Darwin went for £50,000 and a bidder agreed to pay £32,500 for one of Einstein’s manuscripts.The sale was named “On the Shoulders of Giants” – a reference to the famous phrase once used by Newton of his own achievements: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”The money raised by the sale of the wheelchair will go to the Stephen Hawking Foundation and the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Hawking lived most of his life with motor neurone disease, before dying at the age of 76 in March.Also on sale were personal copies of the British physicist’s papers, such as a copy of his 1974 article, Black Hole Explosions?, in which he predicted that black holes would release blackbody radiation, known as Hawking Radiation. The paper sold for £7,500.A copy of his bestselling A Brief History of Time, signed with a thumbprint, sold for £68,750, a bomber jacket went for £40,000 and the script for one of his appearances on The Simpsons sold for £6,250.Hawking’s daughter, Lucy, said the sale gave “admirers of his work the chance to acquire a memento of our father’s extraordinary life in the shape of a small selection of evocative and fascinating items”.Hawking’s children hope to preserve his scientific archive for the nation. Christie’s was handling the negotiations to hand it over to British authorities in lieu of inheritance tax.Other notable items included a document signed by Isaac Newton repaying a loan, which sold for £56,250, a letter from Charles Darwin described as his “glowing review of the naturalist’s report on the Challenger expedition”, which sold for £15,000, and a copy of Einstein’s views on Newton, which was once owned by the former’s son and sold for £13,750."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40582ee3b789f8efbd5ae34fdd1e5c3e3b91d042/0_142_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58588d7b13b290d68126ba8e4b39ea52","title":"nat sciver england womens world t20 katherine brunt ruled out","story":"England have been dealt a major blow by Katherine Brunt’s departure at the women’s World T20 and Australia will be favourites in West IndiesThe last time England played Sri Lanka in a major tournament opener, at the 2013 World Cup, they lost in embarrassing fashion to the tournament’s bottom-ranked team. Five years on, as they gear up for their opening game against the same opposition in St Lucia on Saturday, this time in a World T20, they will be hoping to avoid a similar fate.This time around, the personnel look rather different. Of England’s 15-strong squad, eight did not play in the last World T20 in 2016, and the batter Sophia Dunkley and left-arm spinners Kirstie Gordon and Linsey Smith have never worn an England shirt.In particular, England will feel the loss of their world-class wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who is staying at home in an effort to manage her anxiety condition and Katherine Brunt, the allrounder who has been ruled out the tournament after scans confirmed a flare-up of her long-standing back problem would not allow her to participate.Brunt will be replaced by the Middlesex batter Fran Wilson, who will not arrive in time for the opening match, but given that the pitches in St Lucia are expected to suit pace, Brunt’s departure is a significant blow. Moreover, Taylor’s reserve, Amy Jones, may be almost equally as deft but has yet to prove herself with the bat in the shortest form, with a highest score of 30 to her name.England are the 50-over champions and ranked third in T20, so go into the tournament as strong contenders but much will hang on the performance of their batters. In June, against South Africa at Taunton, the world record total in women’s T20s was broken twice in the same day: women’s T20 cricket is rapidly becoming a batter’s game. England will take heart from that performance, in which they reached 250 for three, thanks to a 47-ball century from Tammy Beaumont. Her opening partner Danni Wyatt has also flourished of late, having hit two T20 centuries in the past 12 months and the Wisden cricketer of the year, Nat Sciver, has also been in fine form, leading Surrey Stars to victory in the Kia Super League.Given Brunt’s absence Sciver, the all-rounder who took 10 wickets in the KSL with her medium pace, is also likely to play an important role with the ball in a squad dominated by spinners. The loss of Brunt may open the way for either Gordon or Smith to make their debut, with the coach Mark Robinson hoping his surfeit of left-arm spinners – the 19-year-old Sophie Ecclestone makes up the trio – will make up for any failings in the fast-bowling department.“We’ve got a bit of a union going on,” Ecclestone said. “We help each other out in training with field settings and general left-arm spinner chat.”England are somewhat fortunate in that they have been drawn in the relatively easy Group A, alongside West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Australia, New Zealand and India (plus Pakistan and Ireland) make up Group B, with their matches taking place in Guyana. England’s biggest group challenge looks to be against the defending champions, West Indies, who dismissed them for 116 in their warm-up, winning by five wickets.Should England top the group they are likely to face New Zealand at the semi-final stage in Antigua. While the Kiwis sit above them in the rankings, England’s utter dominance over them in the summer, culminating in a seven-wicket win in the Tri-series final, should leave them confident of victory. A bigger concern will be ensuring they avoid a semi-final against Australia and thus any chance of a repeat of their 2016 WWT20 encounter in India, whereby they collapsed horribly and lost by five runs.As three-times champions and the No 1 ranked side, Australia pose a formidable threat. With a batting lineup so long the ’s top-rated female cricketer of 2018, Ellyse Perry, features only at No 7, it is easy to see why they are the favourites. Their bowling unit is also threatening, with the young left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux, who finished as leading wicket-taker in their whitewash of Pakistan last month, looking to make her name during the tournament.All 23 matches will be broadcast live, with the decision review system in use for the first time at a T20 World Cup. The standalone tournament, the first of its kind, should be another step forward for the women’s game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b4a66eec320532a717a676321e1192ce9111952/0_64_3335_2001/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffb39762e9ecfa0ddf6ea3ff78b43c5d","title":"sri lanka england win first test match report","story":"An ugly sequence has come to an end. Upon their arrival in Galle England had gone 13 consecutive matches overseas without a victory, their longest barren run in Test cricket. Here below a thousand English supporters up on the Dutch fort unable to find a place amid the full house inside the ground, most of whom were also from the UK, England delivered a comprehensive victory by 211 runs – and a highly satisfying one in which the best-laid plans came to fruition.Their execution on the fourth day was not flawless. Two of their best fieldsmen, Ben Stokes and Jimmy Anderson, inexplicably dropped two simple chances, and an extremely tough one eluded Ben Foakes, who otherwise had a brilliant, man-of-the-match winning debut. But overall England thoroughly outplayed their opponents on alien territory and therefore registered their first victory on one of the most delightful cricket grounds in the world. There was a zest and unity about their performance and, as with the one-day side, a sense of enjoyment. They really seemed to relish each others’ success. More and more as the stalwart old timers are absent this feels like Joe Root’s side.Leaving aside the scale of England’s victory the match did not quite follow the anticipated pattern since runs were much easier to come by than is often the case here. The ball did not spin as venomously as in Sri Lanka’s last match in Galle against South Africa in July. Maybe the damp weather before and during this match was a factor. It was miraculous after torrential overnight rain that play could start on time but the system of covering every blade of grass on the playing area had worked superbly again. Maybe the groundstaff were sympathetic to the good traders of Galle who welcome the advent of so many overseas visitors eager to eat, drink and be merry.So England had to be patient since there were very few unplayable deliveries being propelled out there – the best was a peach from Jack Leach, which trimmed the bails of Dinesh Chandimal, the one batsman to fall before settling in at the crease. The rest seemed to be in control but they could not last long, more because of their own shortcomings than the brilliance of the bowling or the vagaries of the pitch. As in the first innings Angelo Mathews was the only Sri Lankan to pass fifty but even he succumbed meekly having reached that landmark.Once again the England spinners did most of the work and took most of the wickets though there was one excellent, hostile spell from Stokes either side of lunch. As in the first innings Moeen Ali ended up with the most victims – another four – and he finished with his best match figures outside of England (8-137). When he dismissed Akila Dananjaya he equalled the haul (153) of one of the great English off-spinners, Fred Titmus. In the off-spinning department there is only Jim Laker (193) and Graeme Swann (255) left for Moeen to pursue. As with John Emburey, whom he overtook in the first innings, Moeen has bowled 5,000 fewer deliveries than Titmus ever did, which reflects how the game has changed.Moeen would acknowledge that Leach did a lot of the hard yards on Friday – and it is no platitude when Moeen says that he hopes England play three spinners in this series. He is more effective when he is given free rein, while someone else is obliged to bowl the tight, containing overs. Leach is better suited to this role, which may be why Root turned to him first in the opening hour, when England failed to take a wicket – in part because of Stokes’ failure to catch an edge off Moeen from Dimuth Karunaratne.Straight after drinks Leach benefited from an ill-judged sweep by Kaushal Silva, who was lbw. Soon after Moeen neatly snapped up a return catch from Karunaratne and, with the last ball before lunch, Stokes willed Dhananjaya de Silva into a fatal nibble outside the off-stump. England were on their way even though Sri Lanka’s most dangerous batsmen – given than Chandimal is not fully fit – Mathews and Kusal Mendis, were together.Now Leach bowled a long spell in partnership with the pace of Stokes and then Anderson. Mendis hit a couple of eye-catching slog sweeps to and beyond the boundary. Then Mendis’s over-ambition prompted his downfall. He hit Leach over a deepish mid-off for four, not quite a clean hit. England wisely left the door ajar by declining to put Moeen all the way back to long-off. Next ball Mendis attacked again. His drive was sliced and Moeen, running back, took the catch as Mendis bashed his pads in exasperation. Soon after Chandimal was defeated by Leach’s best delivery and the Sri Lankan tail was exposed.Moeen, with a little assistance from Stokes’ safer hands at slip and Adil Rashid’s loopiest leg breaks, mopped up quickly. Poor Rangana Herath’s Test career did not end gracefully. In his last act a sprawling e left him millimetres short of his ground. The England players politely waited for him to be dusted down before he walked away on a red carpet that had been rolled out for a final exit that did not go quite as planned.

The second Test starts on Wednesday in Kandy - can a Herath-free Sri Lanka recover from this emphatic defeat for that one? Do join us again to find out, but till then ... farewell!Joe Root collects the winners’ cheque. This is what he’s got to say:We were very attacking at the start of the day. We wanted to go out there and score at a decent rate, and not just sit in a bunker and let Sri Lanka bowl at us. At least we were 100-5 not 50-5. Then the pitch changed. It dried out slightly, it got a lot easier rotating and more comfortable to bat on, and the guys adapted extremely well to that. For a guy to come in on his debut and deliver an innings of that standard is exactly what you’re after. So I’m really proud of him and really proud of the rest of the guys. The lower order played some really good knocks and got us up to a good score.We’ve done our homework. We made suree that we came here knowing how we were going to approach things and more than anything letting our guys bowl their best balls as often as possible. I thought that as a group we managed to do that for long periods of time and build a lot of good pressure. Not just the spinners, the seamers as well. As a bowling unit we were excellent.We need to take everything we’ve done in this game and as much as we can transfer it to the rest of the tour. It’s been a fantastic start and we’ve got to build on it, and hopefully back up a really good performance. Our batting was below par during the game. If you display that kind of batting you can’t stay in the game. Credit to the England game, they played some outstanding cricket. We got a really good start in the first session but we couldn’t capitalise on that start. We fought hard as a bowling unit, but we couldn’t get that wicket at the end. We need to regroup as a team and are looking forward to the next game.Batting is the main concern. We need to sit together and discuss where it went wrong. It’s a really hard day for us. We all know how much Rangana has done for the team and for Sri Lankan cricket, so it’s a very emotional day. We wish him a really good future.He says his groin strain is progressing. And he gives Herath something in a frame, and a signed shirt.Rangana was a really big part, he has done so much for the team and for Sri Lankan cricket, especially off the field. If we have a problem definitely we will go to him. He has given very good advice, he’s a tremendous man and a great human being.The post-match presentations are in full swing, and Ben Foakes is named man of the match on debut.It’s been a pretty surreal few days. It’s been a dream. I was just a bit nervous in my head, I didn’t really know what the scoreboard was, so to be able to contribute was amazing. It’s very tough out here, mentally as well trying to stay switched on, especially against the class of spinners that they’ve got. So it was good fun.It’s a dream come true. It’s just been one of the best weeks of my career, if not the best.“As the left arm artist walks off the field one last time, I will call him ageful!” writes Abhijato Sensarma. “He has never been an ageless player - always looked to be old, to be honest, but old like wine, if you would allow me to use that overused expression. He was mindful of the fact. He was not the most athletic of people, yet he could perform the greatest catches of all time, as one search on the Internet will show. He was never in the limelight, even when he was. If not for Murali, he would have been Sri Lanka’s greatest player. But he doesn’t mind the lack of opportunities. What a humble anti-rockstar he is. Always conscious of his limitation, yet composing canvasses of beautiful spells of spin bowling for us to adore as long as cricket lives. Ageful he was, yes, and how.”Rangana Herath speaks to Sky:I have been in an emotional situation, but everybody has to take a decision at the right time. I am thankful that all those I have played with, all those people who are behind, all those people I must thank. It’s been a privilege and an honour to play for my country. In Sri Lanka we have 22 million people. Very few people get the opportunity to play for Sri Lanka. That’s a remarkable achievement and honour for any player.I wish to play some first-class cricket but we’ll see how it goes in the coming months. I need to go back to where I work, I need to have a bit of a chat, but I want to play a bit of first-class cricket, not full-time cricket.Apologies by the way for the extended pause in updates, as the OBO was cruelly hit by site-wide technical issues, fixed just in time for the denouement.That was emphatic from England, who claim their first victory in Galle in style. They had lost two and drawn two of their four previous visits, but were very much second best in both those draws - in one they were 112 runs behind with one wicket remaining, and in the other they had followed on and were still 167 short of Sri Lanka’s massive first-innings total of 499-8dec when the match ended. So in the context of England’s inglorious 17-year history at this venue, this was quite an achievement.A despairing e is not enough to save him, as Herath is short by perhaps an inch, and the match and his career ends with the great man face down in the dust!84th over: Sri Lanka 248-9 (Lakmal 14, Herath 3) Lakmal chases a wide one from Rashid and slashes it through the covers for four, the only runs from the over. The players are having some drinks. While they do so, here’s some cricket news for you:83rd over: Sri Lanka 244-9 (Lakmal 10, Herath 3) Singles from the first two Moeen deliveries, and then a four-ball batting examination that Herath just about passes. The penultimate delivery is a stonker, turning sharply, rising, and darting off towards slip..82nd over: Sri Lanka 242-9 (Lakmal 9, Herath 2) Rashid takes off yet more pace, and locates yet more turn. 81st over: Sri Lanka 240-9 (Lakmal 8, Herath 1) Fans crowd the fences in anticipation of the coup de grace, but Moeen cannot deliver it. Maiden.80th over: Sri Lanka 240-9 (Lakmal 8, Herath 1) Well that was dramatic.No, not the slightest touch. Not even close. Fairytale last-match century still theoretically possible.He’s reviewed it immediately! Did he nick this one on its way through?Finally Rashid gets his reward! This has been a fine spell, and eventually Dilruwan nicks one straight into the hands of Stokes. And out comes Rangana Herath, to a standing ovation, for his final Test innings.79th over: Sri Lanka 238-8 (Perera 30, Lakmal 7) Lakmal, facing his sixth ball without getting off the mark, advances to Moeen and smites him down the ground for six. “I don’t know what Internet Translator Andrew Benton is using but Biff is most definitely not Biff in German - Schlag, Hieb or Stoß I could accept but there is no biff,” insists Pete. “Unless he’s talking about the German pronunciation of “corned beef” which is always pronounced “Corn-Ed-Biff”.”78th over: Sri Lanka 230-8 (Perera 29, Lakmal 0) Sri Lanka add injury to, well, whatever else it is that they’re feeling, with Lakmal thumping the ball straight at Dilruwan, who squirms his body out of the way but only lets it hit him on the side of his right hand. That looks sore.77th over: Sri Lanka 229-8 (Perera 28) Moeen bowls a limp full toss, and Perera thunders it down the ground for six! Then he heaves another poor ball through midwicket for four! Then he takes a single off the fifth, leaving Akila to edge the last into the hands of Stokes at slip!76th over: Sri Lanka 218-7 (Perera 17, Akila 8) Rashid comes in to bowl, but in his delivery stride, with his right arm wheeling, he trips over his own trousers and falls over! He gets up, tucks his trousers into his socks, and goes again.75th over: Sri Lanka 212-7 (Perera 16, Akila 3) A Moeen maiden, enlivened by one ball that looped up off Dilruwan’s arm and Foakes, not knowing what it had come off but wanting to catch it just in case, threw himself to the ground to get his left glove underneath it. Fine, agile keeping, if unrewarded on this occasion. 74th over: Sri Lanka 212-7 (Perera 16, Akila 3) Akila tries to reverse sweep Rashid, misses the ball and it clips his glove and loops over wicketkeeper and slip before plopping limply but safely to the turf. 73rd over: Sri Lanka 208-7 (Perera 15, Akila 0) Sri Lanka, and Dilruwan in particular, is picking out the boundary with regularity. He turns the final ball of the over off his pads and to long leg for four.72nd over: Sri Lanka 204-7 (Perera 11, Akila 0) A lovely over from Rashid, varying his pace, finding grip and turn, making life extremely uncomfortable for any nearby bat-wielders.71st over: Sri Lanka 202-7 (Perera 10, Akila 0) Perera drives Moeen’s first delivery through cover for four. “I guess “Pok” is French for “Biff”. Learning French with OBO - magnifique!” enthuses Andrew Benton. “According to the internet translator, Biff is Tortazo in Spanish and Sterke Slag in Dutch, and Nyrkinishu in Finish, but Biff in Italian and German. Kazaaaam and Thruuuung to be determined and keeping Sock for later.”70th over: Sri Lanka 198-7 (Perera 5, Akila 0) So of England’s three spinners Moeen has three wickets, Leach has three wickets, and Rashid is still looking for his first. He’s bowling pretty well at the moment, but as yet without reward.69th over: Sri Lanka 197-7 (Perera 4, Akila 0) Not even non-existent rain can save Sri Lanka now. Especially not non-existent rain. Of all kinds of rain, that is the least helpful kind.The ball holds up off the pitch and Mathews, on the back foot, pushes it straight to Buttler at midwicket! And that is curtains for Sri Lanka!68th over: Sri Lanka 195-6 (Mathews 52, Perera 3) Rashid continues to find some good turn in the pitch, but it’s well handled. 67th over: Sri Lanka 192-6 (Mathews 51, Perera 1) And that is precisely the start to the session that England wanted, and Sri Lanka dreaded. Not that they really had a rational hope of saving the match anyway, but whatever optimism they might have managed to build among their team during tea was immediately deflated. Not great play by Dikwella, but a predictably ace catch from Stokes.A wicket falls from the first ball after tea! Dikwella pushed forward, the ball clips the outside edge and Stokes takes a fine one-handed catch at slip!“You seem to have invented a new shot - the pok (60th over),” writes Geoff Wignall. “I’m rather taken with it, in a way that wouldn’t work for the driv, glanc or nudg. (I think I might have seen the occasional nurdl from the England team of the 90s or was that a mythical sea creature?)I reckon there might be room in the ever evolving game for the swep and hok also. PS I’m not a cricket coach.”It actually wasn’t a mistake. As I recall, in Asterix magic-potion-fuelled Gauls used to frequently send Romans flying with a thunderous uppercut accompanied by a large cartoon POK! I could be wrong, it being about 40 years since I last looked at an Asterix comic, but that’s what I was thinking of. Anyway, the players are back out, and ...And that is tea. Sri Lanka have a short break in which to pray for rain, which is inevitable (if you look at the forecast) or wildly unlikely (if you look at the clear blue skies above Galle). Back in a little bit.66th over: Sri Lanka 190-5 (Mathews 50, Dickwella 16) Mathews reaches his half-century in style, moving forward to meet the ball on the half-volley and driving it sweetly through midwicket. Then he leaves one that goes straight, and the ball misses off stump by an inch!65th over: Sri Lanka 186-5 (Mathews 46, Dickwella 16) Three runs from the over, all plundered from Moeen’s first couple of deliveries. Time for one more before tea, then.64th over: Sri Lanka 183-5 (Mathews 43, Dickwella 16) Dickwella reverse sweeps nicely for a couple, even though the ball pitched not far from where it had for the final delivery of Rashid’s previous over. It worked out well, though in the circumstances was perhaps unnecessarily gutsy. Unabashed, he drives through the covers for four.63rd over: Sri Lanka 175-5 (Mathews 42, Dickwella 9) Again the final delivery is the most interesting, Mathews trying to paddle it to midwicket but the ball not doing at all what he expected, and clipping his pad instead. 62nd over: Sri Lanka 173-5 (Mathews 41, Dickwella 8) Rashid’s final delivery starts out very wide, but turns extravagantly and jags back towards the stumps, to the evident surprise of Dickwella, who manages to ert it with the handle of his bat.61st over: Sri Lanka 171-5 (Mathews 40, Dickwella 7) Moeen Ali, the most expensive of England’s bowlers so far, returns for an eighth over. Four gentle, jogged singles follow, which tickles his economy rate up slightly to 3.87 - other than him only Rashid (3.33) is going for more than three runs an over, and he’s about to have a go himself.60th over: Sri Lanka 167-5 (Mathews 38, Dickwella 5) Mathews poks the ball through the covers for four, lovely shot.58th over: Sri Lanka 159-5 (Mathews 31, Dickwella 4) Hello everyone! Simon here, taking over from Tanya for the remainder of the day. Please do email me here, or there’s always the Twitter. Good control here from Anderson, pinning the batsmen back. They get a couple of singles.57th over: Sri Lanka 157-5 (Mathews 30, Dickwella 3) A maiden from Leach, the last ball turning past the outside edge of Mathew’s bat. Foakes whips the bails off, but Mathew’s foot is safely behind the crease. And that’s it from me. Sorry my email address didn’t work properly but please get in touch with Simon Burnton with any ideas about the future OBO dating service as he covers the death rattle of this Test. Bye!56th over: Sri Lanka 157-5 (Mathews 30, Dickwella 3) Dickwella survives Anderson’s over. Gets a couple from a firm push through the covers. I fancy a coffee. 55th over: Sri Lanka 155-5 (Mathews 30, Dickwella 1) A third wicket for Leach. That ball really did have it all - line, length, drift, turn and a fist-full of magic. Sri Lanka on the ropes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e66604ff0937bd00642e043ceb2d4798bd475ff/0_127_2267_1359/master/2267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0aaf1d897fdb34969e050f85d49cd46","title":"ian mckellen to celebrate 80th birthday with 80 date tour","story":"The UK tour will visit theatres with a personal connection to the actor and performances will encourage audience members to share the stageIan McKellen is to celebrate his 80th birthday next year by asking audience members to act alongside him as he goes on an 80-date live tour. He will visit some of the UK’s grandest theatres but also amateur groups, fringe venues, pub theatres, drama schools and small arts centres, many of which have a personal connection for the actor. “The show starts with Gandalf and will probably end with an invitation to act with me on stage,” says McKellen. “In between there will be anecdotes and acting.”The tour begins in January with a two-night run at his local theatre, the Space, in east London. Later dates include Coventry’s Belgrade theatre, where he had his first professional job (“I stayed a year, on £8.50 a week”), Cambridge Arts theatre, where he acted as an undergraduate, and Wigan Little theatre, where he saw his first Shakespeare production as a child.McKellen will also perform in many theatres for the first time and will tailor his material to each venue. He will visit Above the Stag in Lambeth, south-east London, because “I wanted to make my debut at London’s only LGBT+ theatre. I will include my memories of the first production of Martin Sherman’s sensational Bent, words from Armistead Maupin and a few surprising gay characters in Shakespeare.”He will celebrate his birthday, 25 May, with a show in Bolton, where he grew up and “discovered in its three professional theatres, a passion for acting, which has never faded. In the town hall, where my father was borough engineer, I’ll feel at home and grateful for all that Bolton nurtured in me.”McKellen will visit the Duke of York’s theatre in the West End, where he made his London debut in 1964 and recently returned to star in No Man’s Land, with Patrick Stewart, and King Lear, which closed earlier this month. He said: “It was a joy to return recently for 100 performances of King Lear – or rather 99 performances. We had to cancel one Saturday matinee after my left leg gave way while running to catch a train. Rather than send the audience home, I gave an impromptu solo show with the aid of a chair and a walking stick.”The solo tour concludes at the National Theatre’s vast Olivier stage, where McKellen has previously starred in Coriolanus, The Real Inspector Hound and a brief solo show about Shakespeare. “Being alone on the Olivier stage is a challenge,” he recalled. During the second performance, my voice gave way, until restored by some voice exercises flat on my back. For my return … I will be upright and audible.”Profits from the tour will benefit specific causes at each theatre, from technical improvements to community outreach programmes, talent development and, at Billingham’s Forum theatre, refurbishments to the bar, where McKellen suggests he’ll meet audiences after the show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027774668281b0d4310ac7f1e2b4602a9b55295a/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad565ca06cdfd36df2aefd07aa2c1df","title":"send a tip on independent tour guides for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tells us about engaging, amusing and knowledgeable tour guides the world over whose services you have enjoyedA good guide or local contact can make a crucial difference to your enjoyment of a trip, bringing a destination to life with their passion, storytelling and wit.

He may have lost his plucky bid to win the first statewide election in Texas as a Democrat since 1994, but he came so close that he thoroughly wiped the smirks off Republican faces.For O’Rourke it marks a phenomenal achievement. In just 19 months, almost unassisted, he took the Texan Democratic party from its virtually moribund condition, gave it a stiff dose of adrenalin, and brought it back to life.For Texas, and for America, the fact that O’Rourke came within striking distance represents something even bigger – the hope that the second largest state in the union might finally be freeing itself from the iron grip of the Republican party.That in turn raises a tantalizing prospect for progressives everywhere – if O’Rourke could do it in Texas, a place synonymous with the modern hardline Republican party, what could he do in other parts of the US?“If you look at the top line and see O’Rourke losing, you’re missing the point,” said Bethany Albertson, associate professor at University of Texas at Austin. “No Democrat has come close in Texas in decades, voter turnout was way up, and young people who have never voted before were drawn for the first time into the Democratic process.”That’s a formula that the Democratic party nationwide is desperate to replicate. But how did he do it? What was the secret of the Beto magic?When O’Rourke set out on his unlikely mission he did so with the contemporary equivalent of a horse and cart. As Rolling Stone has pointed out, at that point he had two aides, both of them old friends from El Paso, and a rented sedan.He put them to good use. By election day he had spawned a vast army of 25,000 volunteers and had raised $70m – all of it through small donations through the online portal ActBlue, not a penny through big corporate donors – more than any US Senate campaign in history.O’Rourke wore through a lot of shoe leather in the process. He crisscrossed a state that is larger than France – from his hometown of El Paso to the eastern border of Texas is 900 miles – visiting each of its 254 counties. His message was: “I wouldn’t vote for a politician I had never seen either.”Wherever he went, he sprinkled seeds of Democratic rebirth. Using digital apps, he empowered volunteers in each county to begin mobilizing their neighbors. It was entirely decentralised, with next to no quality control, which meant trusting volunteers implicitly – but it succeeded in unleashing huge reserves of untapped energy.Carrie Collier-Brown, a lawyer from the suburbs of south-west Austin, was one of the new Beto super-volunteers. She described what it has been like this year creating a team of about 150 volunteers in her area out of nothing.“We built the infrastructure out of scraps and with no instructions,” she said. “It feels like we’ve been flying by the seat of our pants all year.”Together with a “bunch of pissed-off suburban women”, as she puts it, she set up in January a group of volunteers which they called “Blue Action Democrats”. Every weekend they knocked on hundreds of doors, liaising closely with the local Beto O’Rourke campaign staff.In the final weeks of the election they were supported by “pop-up offices”, more than 700 of which mushroomed across Texas. The offices were improvised out of volunteers’ spare rooms, studies, garages, garden sheds – any space where the all-important get-out-the-vote drive could be spearheaded.The numbers tell the story. Sixty-eight percent of registered voters in Collier-Brown’s area turned out and cast their ballot – twice the proportion in the last midterm elections in 2014 and slightly more even than the 2016 presidential election.Collier-Brown said that there was a price to pay – “My kids are very close to calling me Aunty Carrie” – but the gains have been immense. “The Beto campaign has taught us an important lesson: that connecting with your neighbors is how to engage everyone, how to take back our democracy, and ultimately how to win elections.”Mark Jones, a professor of political scientist at Rice University, thinks that 10-point swing was partly explained by a female backlash to the vulgarity, aggressive posturing and sexual impropriety of Donald Trump. But that was not all.“Beto O’Rourke wasn’t just campaigning against Trump. He was campaigning for a different kind of politics that are optimistic, positive. He spoke to thousands of people who are upset about the isiveness in America today.”Soon after O’Rourke had conceded defeat on Tuesday night, he addressed thousands of his loyal supporters in a baseball stadium in El Paso. He told them: “We’re not about being against anybody. We are not going to define ourselves by who or what we are against, or what we are afraid of or scared about. We are great people.”That message also spoke to the second key group mobilized by his campaign – young people. Again, the numbers tell the story.Not only did he win over young people in far greater proportions, he also crucially managed to unlock a door that has been frustratingly closed to progressive causes in vast swathes of America for years. He persuaded young voters who usually overwhelmingly opt to stay at home in midterm elections to get off their couches, get over to the polling stations, and vote.Figures for overall Texas turnout have yet to be completed, but early voting data is again stunning. The number of 18 to 29-year-olds casting an early ballot this year was five times greater than in the 2014 midterms.He also speaks the language of the young. He is fluent in Instagram and Snapchat, and has a flair for producing viral videos, whether air-drumming to The Who or skateboarding through a Whataburger parking lot.When the  talked shortly before the election to Karl Rove, the ultimate political kingmaker in Texas who helped turn the state Republican in the 1990s, he was dismissive about O’Rourke’s most viral video. In it, the Democratic candidate defended NFL players who had taken the knee during the national anthem in protest at police brutality, saying there was “nothing more American” than that.For Rove, that video demonstrated that O’Rourke would never be able to win over the mainstream of the Texan electorate as he was too outspokenly liberal. What Rove may not have counted on, however, was how electrifying such a statement might have been for many younger Texans who are more receptive to new expressions of patriotism.O’Rourke amplified his natural affinity with younger voters through a heavy push on social media. Much of the $70m he raised through small online donations – twice the amount brought in by his opponent – went on digital advertising, especially on Facebook where ads were kept to six seconds or less and tightly targeted both geographically and on voters’ personal interests.According to the Texas Tribune, for much of 2018 his campaign invested more than any other political advertiser on Facebook. In the last six months more than $6m of O’Rourke ads on the site were viewed almost 20 million times.Young voters, white women, Latinos, online fundraising, digital advertising, social media, volunteering, shoe leather – the Beto O’Rourke campaign had it all in terms of modern electioneering. It may have been largely improvised, and there was no instruction manual, but it did the job.Not only did it bring O’Rourke within a hare’s whisker of pulling off the biggest political upset in decades, it also had a knock-on effect for other Democratic candidates lower down the ticket. The impact was even more pronounced in the state legislature where two Republican state senators were turfed out and at least 12 Texas House seats flipped from the Republicans to Democrats.In many ways the explosion of energy that O’Rourke has brought to the progressive movement in Texas bears comparison to the equally audacious campaign conjured up by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race.Both politicians are notable for their charisma and rhetorical skills, and for the skill in which they communicated through social media and in person.Which is why, perhaps inevitably, whispers of “Beto 2020” can already be heard floating in the Texan wind. “Beto has done the near impossible,” said Mark Jones. “If he wants to run for the White House, there’s definitely a lane open for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71cc4544dd5e0ab5b912881c5d397255d8687f5c/723_219_4371_2624/master/4371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15b15fe229d85cf555fea88cf4f9c7c1","title":"florida amendment 4 felons voting rights response activists","story":"Amendment 4 passed with strong bipartisan support by a large margin in a state notorious for razor-close electionsValencia Gunder has found no shortage of ways to leave her mark on her local community in and around low-income neighborhoods of Miami, Florida.As a community organizer, she has railed against climate change and its specific effects in displacing marginalized people from housing. During moments of crisis, like 2017’s Hurricane Irma, she has mobilized to help low-income black and Hiic south Floridians with relief and recovery.She has founded the not-for-profit, Make the Homeless Smile, in a part due to her own experiences with homelessness.But for years, there has been one fundamental mark Gunder has been legally forbidden from making. Thanks to a felony conviction over a bad check she wrote to her university in 2007, Gunder was unable to cast a ballot in an election for the past eight years.“The fact that I’m an organizer, I’m an activist, and I’m an advocate, and I’m out here in the community making change but I can’t really participate? It’s hurtful,” she said.That changed in the midterm elections on Tuesday night when Florida voters offered resounding support to a ballot measure titled Amendment 4 to reinstate voting rights for nearly all of the state’s estimated 1.5 million ex-felons or “returning citizens” as campaign organizers prefer to call them.Gunder, exhausted from campaigning for Amendment 4 by speaking at events and knocking on doors, was elated over the change.“As a United States citizen, as a resident of the state of Florida, as a person who is affected by these leaders that we put into office and the decisions that are being made, I should be able to weigh in,” Gunder said. “I strongly believe that taxation without representation is against my human rights and civil rights as a United States citizen.”The excitement was palpable too at the campaign headquarters of Andrew Gillum, the failed Democratic candidate for governor, on Tuesday night. Even as the candidate himself prepared to concede defeat to his Republican opponent, the assembled crowd let out a joyous applause when it was announced that the measure, which Gillum strongly supported, had passed.“It took me 18 years to get my rights back,” said George Jackson, a Miami resident and Gillum supporter. “We’ve been pushing it, pushing it, pushing it and finally it happened – so we’re super-excited.”Jackson picked up a felony in 1989, at the age of 19, for armed robbery. He said he grew up poor, fell in with a bad crowd and was seduced by the promise of easy money. By the late 1990s, though, Jackson had changed direction, managing a landscaping business and doing comedy on the side.He became politically engaged in trying to restore the voting rights of returning citizens after years of feeling like something essential had been taken from him.“Voting is a right, not a privilege. It’s like they took away our driving rights,” Jackson said.That surprised some spectators, but not Gunder, who said that part of mobilizing the campaign was built around uncoupling it from the usual partisan politics.“We made sure people understood that this was a ‘people’s’ issue, not a ‘specific type of people’, not a certain religion or race, but that this was a people’s issue that everyone was affected by,” Gunder said.Neil Volz, a fellow returning citizen and board member with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition – one of the main groups that agitated for the change – hammered that point home too.A former registered Republican himself, Volz said that in order to win support it had been important to challenge the conventional wisdom that said that reinstating voting rights for ex-felons could mean a “blue wave” of new voters for Democrats in the swing state.That logic had basically held since the fallout from the 2000 presidential election, which turned on less than 1,000 votes in Florida, and which was when many Americans became familiar with felon disfranchisement.The simplest version of the argument held that, since ex-felons are disproportionately black in Florida, and black voters disproportionately support Democrats, granting voting rights would be a net boon to Democratic candidates.Research shows it isn’t so simple. It’s true that the criminal justice system disproportionately ensnares black Americans, but in raw numbers, the largest cohort of ex-felons in Florida are white men, who tend to vote for Republicans.A 2012 study by a researcher at Northwestern found that if ex-felons had been able to vote in the 2000 election, it might have actually bolstered the vote totals for George Bush’s narrow victory. A recent study from Vox had similar findings.Volz, who lost the right to vote after a fraud conviction while working as a political lobbyist, said at best it’s unclear what the partisan impact will be of refranchisement, but that the smartest thing to do is just “let this play itself out”, because the underlying principles are more important than which party controls what.He described a scene of hugs and tears of joy when the initiative was projected to win, at an election night watch party with hundreds of formerly convicted folks in Orlando on Tuesday night.“It felt like there’s a lid on my participation in my own community because of something that happened a long time ago, that I have already you know, paid back my debt for,” Volz said.“On Tuesday, we got to lift that lid off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7075631492626e67b1a088499fb34892072c67/2_70_1730_1038/master/1730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61306715b0c73e9a9ecbdc0c8c790cce","title":"friday briefing brexit secretary discovers channel trade route","story":"Raab’s startling admission – plus, stoppable backstop won’t satisfy Brexiteers … malaise on our high streets … and Damon Albarn’s Blackpool epiphanyHello readers, I’m Warren Murray, let’s get some news coursing through your brains.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has made the stunning admission that he didn’t realise how important the Dover-Calais crossing was to trade. Raab resorted to a more developed version of Trumpian “a lot of people didn’t know” phraseology, saying “I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent” to which Britain depends on the Channel. As Rafael Behr puts it: “It is no longer surprising that people who were once confident that Britain had nothing to lose by leaving the EU neither understood what Brexit meant in practice, nor thought to ask.”Thousand Oaks shooting – Twelve people have been killed in southern California by a gunman who opened fire in a crowded bar with a handgun and then shot himself dead. Officials identified the shooter as former US marine Ian Long, 28. The mass shooting took place at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks. Among the victims was sheriff’s deputy Ron Helus, who was fatally shot when he exchanged gunfire with Long inside the bar. On Thursday the streets outside a local hospital filled with local residents who waved American flags as Helus’s body was transported to the coroner’s office.A vigil formed at the bar where many of the patrons on Wednesday night were students of nearby California Lutheran University. They included recent graduate Justin Meek, 23, who, the university said, died having “heroically saved lives in the incident”.Sanders accosts the truth – The White House has stood by its decision to revoke the access of CNN reporter Jim Acosta, as press secretary Sarah Sanders defended sharing a doctored video that made it look like Acosta had been physically aggressive towards an intern. Acosta pulled back on a microphone and said “Pardon me, ma’am” as a White House staffer tried to yank it away, as the actual video shows. Sanders has been condemned for sharing a version put out by a far-right conspiracy site. Matt Dornic, a CNN executive, tweeted at Sanders: “You released a doctored video – actual fake news. History will not be kind to you.”Simon Jenkins writes this morning that the Acosta-Trump clash underlines how the president will never be out-ranted. “The fact is, being rude to Trump hasn’t worked … He is shameless, and still there.”Mueller still steadily digging – With the president having sacked Jeff Sessions and installed a stand-in who is hostile to the Trump-Russia investigation, we have a timely piece on the work special counsel Robert Mueller is doing to uncover any links from campaign to Kremlin. Better buckle in – it is dense reading in parts, but full of detail about dealings between the likes of Paul Manafort and a cast of Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, consultants and intermediaries. A new name coming in for scrutiny is Konstantin Kilimnik, who worked with Manafort for Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin. Kilimnik and Manafort are charged with a conspiracy to cover up unregistered lobbying work in the US.Fears of Polish hate march – Preparations for Sunday’s centenary of the restoration of Polish independence are being overshadowed by the potential of a worsening of last year’s ugly scenes. On Wednesday the mayor of Warsaw banned a march held each year by nationalists. But she was vetoed by Poland’s rightwing President Andrzej Duda, who effectively said it would proceed on the authority of the Polish state. Last year’s march attracted an estimated 60,000 people including rightwing activists from across Europe. It was condemned for displays of racist banners and slogans, and violence directed at counter-protesters. “Instead of being full of excitement and happiness, we are fearing for the safety of people in our capital,” said Michał Szuldrzynski, a columnist with the centre-right paper Rzeczpospolita.Carole Cadwalladr has been covering Brexit’s biggest donor for over a year.

Unless Jacob Rees-Mogg is prepared to go to Blackpool on a Saturday night and have a fucking great time.” Albarn and his band The Good, the Bad \u0026amp the Queen have been trying to figure out what’s become of England since the EU referendum. The title track to their new album, Merrie Land, questions the strange alliance between working-class Brexit voters and privately educated Brexiteers: “You were the ones who work together  Put the money in the pockets  Of the few and their fortunes  Who crowd the school benches  And jeer at us all because they don’t care about us  They are graceless and you shouldn’t be with them.”Merrie Land comes nearly 12 years after their self-titled debut. Like that record, this one was created by Albarn, former Clash bassist Paul Simonon, the trailblazing Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and guitaristkeyboard player Simon Tong, late of the Verve. Simonon describes Merrie Land as a work of “modern English folk music with a bit of rub-a-dub in it”. “This time around, people can dance,” says Allen, a youthful 78. “With the first record, people asked me: ‘Tony Allen – what the fuck are you doing on this album? We don’t hear you.’ This time around, nobody’s going to ask me that. They can hear me on every track.” John Harris meets Albarn and bandmates in Maidstone.

She will never forget the warm welcome she received after crossing into the Netherlands• Bob and Ann Kirk: ‘We thought we were going on an adventure’• Bernd Koschland: ‘I’m grateful my parents sent me away to carry on living’• Ruth Barnett: ‘When I was 14, my mother appeared out of nowhere’Bea Green’s father was a lawyer in Munich. He had suffered early at the hands of the Nazis – he was beaten up in 1933 for daring to complain to the police about the treatment of one of his clients. They paraded him around the town with a placard round his neck saying: “I am a Jew and I will never again complain to the police.” He came home, the sound of him entering the house waking the eight-year-old Bea as she lay in bed ill, and retired to his bedroom, trying to hide the bruises and the bleeding.Her father was allowed to carry on working after 1933, but only for Jews. He wasn’t yet trying to get out of Germany, even though his cousin and business partner had already fled to Palestine. “He was very defiant,” the 93-year-old says. “It was like stamping your foot and saying: ‘I won’t let these bastards make me go.’” His family had been in Bavaria for generations, and he was not willing to quit his homeland easily.After Kristallnacht, however, even he realised it was time. He was given a phone warning that the police were going to pick him up, and he fled to Luxembourg, where his sister lived, staying there for several months. Bea’s older brother Hans was training to be a brewer at a local college and when he went in on the morning after Kristallnacht, all his non-Jewish friends – who were unaware that he was Jewish – were emptying their pockets and showing off the jewellery they had plundered from Jewish stores the night before. He never returned to the college, finding his way to the UK with the aid of a Jewish organisation, to work as a cinema projectionist in Liverpool.Thanks to a contact made by a former client who had escaped to Britain, Green’s father secured her a sponsor in the UK and a place on a Kindertransport. She boarded a train from Munich in June 1939, and recalls the warm welcome from the Dutch when it crossed the border from Germany. “They gave us orange juice and white bread and butter,” she says. “Nothing had ever tasted so good. I was completely bowled over that these non-Jewish people were nice to us. One of the little girls was crying and I remember a large Dutch lady hugging her. A Jewish girl – and the woman was not Jewish!” Six years in Nazi Germany had made such compassion from non-Jews unthinkable.With their children safely in the UK, her parents were desperately trying to get themselves out. The UK proved impossible, but with the help of a contact in the Peruvian embassy in Germany and a cousin in Peru, in November 1939 they were able to flee to South America, making an epic journey across the Soviet Union, China and Japan, and then going by ship to San Francisco, before heading south to Lima. Green says her mother kept a diary in which she recorded seeing the Golden Gate Bridge, built just a few years earlier, from the deck of the ship. “Today, if I visit my son in San Francisco, where he is a science professor, if I stand at the first-floor window of his house I can see the same bridge. It is such a curious link between the past and the present.”They wrote to her brother, who by then was in the British army, to say they were safe in Peru – a relief after six months of silence. But Green didn’t meet them again until 1952, after her failed first marriage. She stayed in Peru for two years and enjoyed being with her parents again, finding no difficulty picking up where they had left off 13 years earlier, but she came back to the UK, remarried and had three sons, all of whom became scientists.Her parents stayed in Peru and lived reasonably happily. Her father even practised law again, and her mother started painting. There is one of her mother’s paintings on the wall, and it is very good. But Green points out a detail that may reveal her parents’ feelings – a beer tankard, harking back to the family’s earlier life. Lima had given them sanctuary, but it seems that part of her mother’s heart was still in Bavaria and the world they had lost.Remembering the Kindertransport: 80 Years On is at the Jewish Museum, 129-131 Albert Street, London NW1 from 8 November to 10 FebruaryTomorrow: Elsa Shamash: ‘For the rest of his life, my father had terrible nightmares that the Gestapo were coming for him.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779c6162d72689ecfcb0f9b46a406c313b892359/0_21_1424_854/master/1424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c273adf6493de121e192d39e47a1d99e","title":"worlds first ai news anchor unveiled in china","story":"The ‘tireless’ artificial news readers simulate the voice, facial movements, and gestures of real-life broadcastersChina’s state news agency Xinhua this week introduced the newest members of its newsroom: AI anchors who will report “tirelessly” all day every day, from anywhere in the country.Chinese viewers were greeted with a digital version of a regular Xinhua news anchor named Qiu Hao. The anchor, wearing a red tie and pin-striped suit, nods his head in emphasis, blinking and raising his eyebrows slightly.“Not only can I accompany you 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I can be endlessly copied and present at different scenes to bring you the news,” he says.Xinhua also presented an English-speaking AI, based on another presenter, who adds: “The development of the media industry calls for continuous innovation and deep integration with the international advanced technologies … I look forward to bringing you brand new news experiences.”Developed by Xinhua and the Chinese search engine, Sogou, the anchors were developed through machine learning to simulate the voice, facial movements, and gestures of real-life broadcasters, to present a “a lifelike image instead of a cold robot,” according to Xinhua.The broadcasters made their debut during China’s annual World Internet Conference, an event meant to be China’s Davos for the tech sector as well as a platform for China’s vision of the internet and potential for new technologies.While China is home to some of the world’s largest tech companies and some 800 million internet users, its internet is one of the most controlled in the world. Observers worry China is turning into a digital police state, with technology from iris and gait recognition being deployed to monitor activists, ethnic minorities in places like Xinjiang, and regular citizens.At the conference in Wuzhen in southern China, attendees saw their photos flash on a screen as soon as they passed through security checks using facial recognition. In a session on fintech, companies discussed cooperating with law enforcement, providing information for negligent citizens to be put on social credit blacklists.“We are an important advocate for peace in cyberspace and a  of order,” said Huang Kunming, head of Communist Party’s propaganda department, speaking at the event. “China stands ready to safeguard the sound order of cyberspace.”According to Xinhua, the AI technology is not limited to news presenting. The systems can be customised to different clients in other industries. Wang Xiaochuan, the head of Sogou, gave the example of a popular book reading app, Uncle Kai. “In the future, it could be your parents telling the story,” he said in an interview.For Xinhua’s already tightly-scripted and controlled state news presenters, the AI anchors take things a step further. Video of the Chinese anchor quickly spread on social media in China, with as many impressed as alarmed. “A little bit horrible,” one viewer said, to which one user responded: “Really scary.” “Another said: “Shivering.”While praising the achievements, Xinhua and Sogou acknowledged its limits. “I, who was wholly cloned from a real-life host, have mastered broadcasting as well as the real host,” the AI anchor said. “As long as I am provided with text, I can speak as a news host.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fedbadad2f4cb0e61f2322420ea0d09670381d6/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0efd9e9c6b5064772e89209238fd3d","title":"the secret lives of trees what to expect in autumn","story":"It’s the season to get lost in beautiful shades of reds, yellows and oranges – but do you know the science behind these vibrant displays, or the role fungi play in the season?“The trees are in their autumn beauty,” wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. “The woodland paths are dry.” Immersed in rich colour and deliciously crunchy underfoot, a woodland walk in autumn is surely one of the most pleasurable and relaxing activities offered by the British countryside.Yet, those excursions are not always quite as straightforward as they appear. For one thing, British trees are rather complicated in their leaf-shedding habits and really vary according to location – autumn takes a while to arrive across the whole country.In the Scottish Highlands, for instance, the woods of the glens are already steeped in golden yellow as early as mid-September. Their canopies are also susceptible to immediate demolition should an early Atlantic storm pass through.In Derbyshire, many woods can often be cleared of vegetation by late October – yet, at the same date in Norfolk, which is more than 300 metres lower in altitude, there are oakwoods looking as emerald green as they did in midsummer. Come November, many trees seem to have barely cast a leaf.Another interesting thing about that leisurely autumn stroll is the environmental intensity that underpins it. Poet John Keats may have famously called it the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”, but it is anything but. What really drives those glorious colours in the trees is the stress of hard work.The element of almost all plants responsible for making summer so green is chlorophyll. But as well as being the miracle worker that turns sunlight to sugar during photosynthesis, chlorophyll is also a precious protein. Before they shed their leaves at the end of season, deciduous trees devote themselves to breaking it down and storing it away for another year.Sugar also plays a part in one of autumn’s most dramatic changes. It reacts with proteins in leaf cells to produce an antioxidant called anthocyanin. It is this red-pigmented agent that supplies the slow-burning glow of British woods. Ironically, the more stressed the trees are, the richer those reds seem to be. Autumn foliage is often more intense, for example, after sharp frosts.Of course, there’s more to the season’s full palate of colour. When you think of the lemon and burnt-biscuit fingers, say, of horse chestnuts, or the dull copper carpet that covers the floor of a December oakwood, those browns and yellows are what happens when a tree’s foliage loses all its chlorophyll.But what really makes autumn such a spectacle is that all these extraordinary colours occur together: so you might get the crimson of London planes colliding with the emerald of holly and ivy, or the scarlet berries of hawthorn and dog rose at the same time as the infinite earth tones of toadstools.Mushrooms may be the most modest player in this infinity of colour, but they supply the other great engine of autumnal change. It is the season when we get to see the extraordinary fruiting bodies, the so-called “toadstools” of fungi. It seems more than coincidence that these bizarre organisms are substantially made from the same stuff as insects – chitin – because, like insects, they have a gift for unexpected appearance. Suddenly they bulb up among tree roots, or emerge out of the heartwood like some chest-bursting creature from Ridley Scott’s Alien.These are the parts that digest the organism’s vegetable diet and then traffic it through the woodland floor. They also play a part in the development and maintenance of the canopy, because fungi in woods forge essential partnerships, whereby the roots of the trees interconnect with what are called mycorrhizal fungi. This link between trees and fungi enables them to share vital nutrients.In a single kilo of woodland soil there can be six miles of hyphae. Beneath an inidual wood, there will be many millions of miles of these fungal networks, and they are at the heart of the extraordinary demolition procedure that is at autumn.Without fungi, the world would be buried in this vegetable junk and life would stagnate for the lack of carbon dioxide.So next time you stroll along a woodland path in autumn with trees changing colour, remember that it’s these incredible underlying, unseen essentials that make everything around us possible."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3691344.1541712776!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how did the hse hire a doctor who did not know the basics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior doctors have expressed concern about the Irish health system’s ever-increasing reliance on overseas doctors and the challenges of adjustment and integration this poses. Photograph: Andrew MatthewsPA WireThe extraordinary case of a clearly under-experienced doctor highlighted by Mr Justice Peter Kelly is far from an unusual occurrence in Irish hospitals.Indeed, the judge pointed out that the case was not isolated and he has come across others where registered doctors “with little knowledge of the basics of medicine” were recruited to work for the HSE.The Medical Council has also expressed concerns about the appointment of junior doctors with inadequate experience and qualifications to the HSE and medical recruitment companies.Privately, senior doctors are quick to express concern about the Irish health system’s ever increasing reliance on overseas doctors and the challenges of adjustment and integration this poses. The system’s equally heavy reliance on temporary, agency staff exacerbates the situation.In recent years, there has been a steady stream of fitness to practise cases from the Medical Council featuring overseas doctors alleged to have made errors while working in Irish hospitals. Doctors from non-EU countries are over-represented in complaints made to the Medical Council.In one case, it emerged the doctor before the inquiry had been hired following a single video-link interview between Ireland and an eastern European country. In other cases, questions were raised about the adequacy of checks on the qualifications of overseas applicants.One area of difficulty that has arisen relates to some doctors who trained in an EU country, often in eastern Europe, but are themselves from a non-EU state. They may have trained in one non-mother tongue and are now practising in Ireland, using a second language, raising challenges.In the most high-profile inquiry, a Sudanese doctor was found guilty on 28 counts of poor professional performance and six counts of professional misconduct after a Medical Council fitness to practise inquiry in 2016. The doctor, who mistook an ankle for an elbow in an X-ray, was taken off on-call duties because of concerns about his performance, but went on to be employed by three other public hospitals.A subsequent report commissioned by the Government identified serious flaws with medical recruitment procedures, including a failure by one hospital to seek references. The report pointed to a lack of centralised recruitment processes for doctors in service posts and the absence of a single human resources system across HSE hospitals.The HSE responded by saying it would establish a standardised policy to deal with references and Garda and medical registration checks prior to the appointment of junior doctors. An electronic personnel file for medical interns would also be rolled out, it was promised.One private sector recruiter told The  that hospitals seemed to prefer hiring short-term agency staff, despite the extra cost, to filling posts permanently. Some “turn a blind eye to English-language tests” and are stricter in vetting headhunted staff than direct hires, the source claimed.The HSE uses a mix of central and localised recruitment, the latter organised through HR units in hospitals. Hospitals also recruit their own junior doctors.Candidates are shortlisted if they meet standard eligibility criteria and are interviewed by a three-person board. Successful candidates are verified by screening their details, references and Garda vetting, the HSE says.A doctor cannot practise in Ireland unless he or she is on the register, but the Medical Council says this does not mean the person is “suitable for every role”.“It rests with employers to determine the suitability of a doctor to fulfil the requirements of a post, and to ensure that they are supported and appropriately supervised in their role,” according to a spokesman.Minister for Health Simon Harris was also quick to point out that recruitment is the responsibility of the HSE. Mr Harris says he wants the HSE to “progress expeditiously” the review of its recruitment processes already under way.Given the review has been under way since 2016, this seems like stating the obvious."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Wilson pleads guilty to various offences linked to planned murder of Gary HanleyINMO has set two -week deadline for Government to table \u0026lsquorealistic\u0026rsquopay offerWilson warns of \u0026lsquoconsequences\u0026rsquo if UK government breaks its side of the agreementFormer EPA director calls for networked strategy, criticises \u0026lsquodysfunctional incrementalism\u0026rsquoUniversity of Limerick students are planning boycott of Aramark-affiliated businessesOver 250 feature, documentary and short films to screen over next ten daysFriday alerts in place for counties in Leinster, Munster and ConnachtEnglish-language teacher did not know if he could afford Christmas presents for his kidsCatholics in Ireland from 1960s onwards found idea of limbo incredible and even cruel, says historianThe \u0026euro39m redevelopment project will provide 72 social homes in Dublin\u0026rsquos inner cityScant interest in high-speed broadband plan casts doubt on viability of national rolloutAuthority to give winter plan to Government in wake of Varadkar remarks on holidaysJohn Deasy credits figures in president\u0026rsquos cabinet for helping progress US-Ireland planSome parents refusing to return children to affected Tyrrelstown school over safety fearsMinisters warned over lack of engagement with Government\u0026rsquos public services portalVaradkar says a November summit on a Brexit deal will be impossibleSamantha Power says Democrats gaining control of seven state legislatures and seven governorships \u0026lsquohuge\u0026rsquoJoan O\u0026rsquoSullivan (50) claims delays may have reduced her life expectancy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3692026.1541760796!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland should copy scotland in managing marine territory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA general view of the Kerry coastline. Ireland’s marine area is ten times its land mass. Photograph: David SleatorTHE IRISH TIMESA former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) director has urged Ireland to follow Scotland’s example in designing the State’s first plan for its marine territory. Scotland has prepared itself for aspects of Brexit in setting up a “one-stop” shop for managing its offshore territory, Dr Micheál Ó Cinnéide told a marine economy seminar in Galway on Thursday.Dr Ó Cinnéide, a former diplomat and former Marine Institute official who recently completed a ten-year term as EPA director, said the potential of Ireland’s offshore territory was such that implementing the new EU marine spatial directive “creates a strong opportunity for change”.Ireland’s marine area is ten times its land mass, while Scotland’s is six times – or 62 per cent of Britain’s sea area, he noted.Public consultations are currently being held by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on Ireland’s first such offshore management plan, which must be implemented by 2021.It aims to mirror land-based planning in prioritising activities extending from the mean high water mark to 200 nautical miles out.Two economic targets have already been identified in the State’s Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth strategy – doubling the value of our ocean wealth, and increasing the turnover of the ocean economy to exceed €6.4 billion by 2030.However, Dr Ó Cinnéide outlined the “dysfunctional incrementalism” which had plagued marine governance to date, where a plethora of departments and agencies were involved , and he said outdated systems governing activities such as aquaculture and ocean energy “lacked credibility”.Dr Ó Cinnéide cited the advantages of a “network” rather than “centralised” model and pointed to examples in other EU member states, such as Marine Scotland which was established in 2009 as a single licensing point for all marine activity in Scottish waters.It has over 700 staff, three research vessels, two patrol vessels and two surveillance aircraft.Dr Ó Cinnéide said Ireland’s marine spatial planning group needed to “benchmark its structure and strengthen its resource base” if it is to be successful in its first cycle from 2020 to 2026, when the plan will be reviewed. The marine spatial-planning group currently has 20 staff, compared to over 650 staff in land-based planning, he noted.He questioned whether this was sufficient to meet the challenges of sustainable management of Ireland’s 490,000 square kilometres offshore.Responding for the department, marine spatial planning official Padraic Dempsey said it had already learned the value of early public engagement.He also said his department had an advantage in having “no vested interested” in any marine sector, and forecast more staff would be hired.The EU’s Marine Spatial Planning directive requires member states to implement a marine plan by 2021 that focuses on how best to “harness” ocean wealth without conflict. Its Marine Strategy Framework directive imposes a duty on member states to achieve good environmental status by 2020.Public consultation on the first draft marine spatial plan closes on December 14th, and there will be further consultation next year.The marine economy conference was hosted by the NUI Galway Socio-Economic Marine Research Unit and the Marine Institute."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3691394.1541715599!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"low rural broadband take up rate alarms government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGovernment fears are mounting  over spending vast sums on a rural broadband network only a minority may actually use.Just one in seven homes in rural Ireland so far offered high-speed broadband by Eir have taken it up, which has raised serious fears in the Government about the viability of its own plans to connect half-a-million isolated homes.Eir is rolling out broadband to 300,000 homes in better-populated rural areas. Earlier this year, it abandoned a plan to connect 500,000 more isolated homes under the State-backed National Broadband Plan.The company no longer reveals how many households have signed up, but figures obtained by The  shows that just 28,000 of the 200,000 homes offered connections up to early this year had taken up subscriptions. The proportion has not changed since, sources indicated, though rural broadband campaigners say that not all houses can receive Eir’s broadband services when the fibre-optic cables are first laid.The low take-up of rural broadband connections has alarmed the Government which is currently considering the future of its plan to spend billions making a high-speed broadband connection available to every household in the State.One senior figure described it as “a bridge to nowhere”.While analysts expect the numbers taking up high-speed broadband connections to increase over time, there are growing fears in Government about spending vast sums of money on a network that only a minority of people may actually use.Eir’s 300,000 homes were thought to be in the most “commercial” parts of the State yet to be connected. Asked about the low take-up of services, one Government source replied: “That doesn’t sound very commercial to me”. The Government’s National Broadband Plan was originally due to cost the State about €500 million. However, The  reported last week that the estimated costs have escalated to an estimated €3 billion – six times the previous estimate.Only one bidder, Enet, remains in the process after several other consortiums – including Eir and another which included the ESB – withdrew.However, the process was paused after minister for communications Denis Naughten resigned three weeks ago after it was revealed that he had had several private meetings with the leader of the remaining bidder, US businessman David McCourt.Details of the bidding process were passed to consultant Peter Smyth who is conducting an audit to ascertain whether the process has been fatally undermined and will have to be abandoned.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Mr Naughten’s replacement, Richard Bruton, said that Mr Smyth’s review would take three weeks, but it has not yet been concluded. It is expected to be finished “within a week or so”, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Some senior figures in Government believe that the audit should and will lead to the current process being abandoned and a new broadband plan drawn up. However, there is a realisation that even a new process will involve enormous investment by the State, and Ministers fear the political fallout from abandoning the broadband plan completely.Although Mr Bruton said last weekend that there is “no question of a plan B”, The  understands that senior officials have discussed the possibility of an alternative approach, known in senior circles as “Plan B”, which may involve an existing State utility company, such as the ESB, being asked to build out the network."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3691930.1541761647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit foster says may is wedded to idea of irish sea border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP Leader Arlene Foster talks to the media at a news conference at Stormont in Belfast last week. Photograph: ReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans have come under fresh pressure after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), upon whose support she relies, said a letter from her about Brexit “raises alarm bells”. The DUP accused the prime minister of breaking a promise that she would never sign up to a deal that treated Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.The party has been angered by a letter in which Mrs May said EU negotiators were still pushing for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and customs union if talks collapse.It has interpreted a promise made by Mrs May in the letter that she would never let a ision of the UK “to come into force” as an admission that such a clause is set to be included in a final deal, the London Times newspaper reported on Friday. The DUP has seized on a particular paragraph - seen by the Times - in which Mrs May said she could not accept circumstances or conditions that could break up the UK customs territory to come into force.DUP leader Arlene Foster, tweeted on Friday: “The PM’s letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union \u0026amp for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole UK. From her letter, it appears the PM is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea with NI in the EU SM regulatory regime.”The leak of the letter is seen by some observers, as well as the DUP, as part of a laying of the ground by Mrs May for a showdown with the party over checks in British ports or factories in Northern Ireland or Britain.Under the EU proposals, UK officials would be “competent authorities” to conduct the checks, but to EU rules, something the DUP has said will cross its “red line”.He said the British government had to abide by the vote of the people, who had voted for Brexit. He went on to warn that a no deal scenario would be “extremely damaging” to the economy of the Republic of Ireland.Mr Wilson said he was concerned that once a legal backdrop is signed up to, “we know the direction that the EU will be heading in. They will veto it ever being removed.”“That’s the harsh reality. All the prime minister’s points (in the letter) are aspirational. The back stop will be legal.”The warning from the DUP underscores the travails Mrs May faces in getting any Brexit orce deal, which London and Brussels say is 95 per cent done, approved by both her fractious party and by the Northern Irish lawmakers who keep her in power.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The prime minister’s letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories. The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.”The EU has insisted on a Northern Ireland-only “backstop to the backstop” in case negotiations on a wider UK approach break down. It is designed to avoid the return of a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Any version of the backstop would apply unless and until a wider UK-EU deal on the future relationship solved the issue of how to avoid a hard border.Ever since Mrs May triggered formal orce talks in March 2017, negotiators have struggled to find a solution to the 400km land border on the island of Ireland.The current proposal would see the whole of the United Kingdom remain inside a temporary customs arrangement with the EU, though it is unclear for how long and what would happen after it exits that.The row comes as Brexit is expected to dominate the agenda of the British Irish Council on Friday, which will be attended by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, David Lidington, who is in effect Mrs May’s deputy, and the Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley. The summit on the Isle of Man will also be attended by the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones.Brexit is also expected to be a focal point when Mrs May meets the French president for a working lunch after attending armistice commemorations in Belgium and France.Downing Street has played down suggestions that a Brexit deal is imminent, after the European council president, Donald Tusk, appeared to indicate a breakthrough could come within the next week.Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have said they will still vote down the government’s Brexit deal, even if May negotiates an exit clause from the Irish backstop, according to the former minister Steve Baker.The cabinet has been locked in a bitter internal wrangle about whether, and how, the government could extricate itself from the backstop, with some ministers concerned May’s plans could leave the UK in a permanent limbo.Mr Wilson said another Brexit referendum would not solve the problem, people would have the same information and would make the same decision, he claimed. - PAAgencies Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

But this landmark wildlife programme is being made by Netflix.The US streaming giant has poached Sir David, alongside the director of BBC series Planet Earth and Blue Planet, in a bid to beat the BBC at its own game.Our Planet is billed as a “groundbreaking” eight-part series, filmed in 50 countries over four years, documenting wildlife from the Arctic wilderness to the jungles of South America. It “will showcase the planet’s most precious species and fragile habitats, revealing amazing sights on Earth in ways they’ve never been seen”.The programme will alert viewers to the dangers facing the planet, hoping for a similar effect to last year’s Blue Planet II which highlighted pollution in the oceans.The BBC holds up its natural history documentaries as an example of what only the BBC can do. But Netflix wants to encroach on that territory, just as it did with drama by producing critically-acclaimed The Crown and House of Cards.While Sir David is a free agent and has previously made programmes for Sky, he has a 40-year association with the BBC and is regarded as one of the corporation’s biggest star names.Footage of a Hardwicke\u0026#39s Woolly Bat in the Borneo rainforestLaunching Our Planet, Lisa Nishimura, vice president of Netflix Original Documentaries, said: “We are delighted that Sir David Attenborough will voice the series and that Netflix, as a global platform, is able to bring this vital and magical series to an audience of over 190 countries worldwide next year.”Our Planet is a collaboration with Silverback Films, the production company run by Alastair Fothergill. A former head of the BBC’s Natural History Unit and the director of Blue Planet, Planet Earth and Frozen Planet, Fothergill described the new series as “our most ambitious endeavour to date”.The announcement comes in the same week that BBC One will broadcast its latest series voiced by Sir David, Dynasties, beginning this Sunday.Speaking at the launch, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC director-general, said: “There is one essential presence at the heart of this series, and that’s David Attenborough.”Charlotte Moore, director of content at the corporation, recently held up Blue Planet II as an example of programming that sets the BBC apart from its commercial rivals.Sir David Attenborough said the show would be \u0026#39a spectacular journey of discovery\u0026#39The series was the biggest British television programme of 2017, with an audience of 14 million, and has been sold to 230 countries.Characterising Netflix and Amazon as media companies with an “insatiable greed for data-gathering”, commissioning shows by algorithm, Moore said Blue Planet II was such a success because it came from “a brilliant, trusted storyteller”.“The success of the series owes so much to David Attenborough - one of the most trusted, authoritative and admired voices on TV. The level of trust that audiences have in David is extraordinary. He’s a reminder that - in a world of so much choice, so many competing voices and sources of information - it is not enough simply to have an important story to tell. It’s who’s doing the telling,” she said.Sir David, giving the World Wildlife Fund’s Planet Address last night, said he was proud of the show.“Our Planet will take viewers on a spectacular journey of discovery, showcasing the beauty and fragility of our natural world,” he said.“Today we have become the greatest threat to the health of our home but there’s still time for us to address the challenges we’ve created, if we act now. We need the world to pay attention. Our Planet brings together some of the world’s best film-makers and conservationists and I’m delighted to help bring this important story to millions of people worldwide.”Our Planet will premiere on Netflix on April 5 2019.Taliban join Moscow talks to kick start Afghanistan negotiations\u0026#39To represent losing the House as a \u0026#39tremendous success\u0026#39 is simply ludicrous\u0026#39:  readers on this week\u0026#39s top storiesMelbourne stabbings: Isil claims suspected terror attack that left one deadIncredible moment Coastguard rescues fishermen stranded on hull of capsized boatWoman left paralysed after being \u0026#39catapulted\u0026#39 from bed during sex act loses attempt to sue supplierTheresa May \u0026#39breaking her promise\u0026#39 to never accept a border in the Irish sea, DUP says -

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

The UK’s projected performance in 2020 is the weakest of the 28\u0026nbspnations currently in the bloc.\u0026nbspThe UK forecasts are worse than\u0026nbspthose made by the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility, which in last week’s Budget projected growth in 2019 of 1.6 per cent, followed by 1.4 per cent in 2020Bottom of the growth leagueThe commission also stressed that even its downbeat outlook was based on a “benign” scenario of UK trade with the rest of the European Union continuing uninterrupted.“The risks to the 2019 and 2020 baseline forecast are large, and predominantly to the downside”, the commission said.The commission said consumer confidence surveys suggested weak spending by households, adding Brexit uncertainty was likely to keep business investment “subdued”. It expects net trade to continue to drag on UK growth and sees the UK unemployment rate rising to 4.7 per cent by 2020, up from 4 per cent today.The commission projected the eurozone’s growth to slow too over the coming years.\u0026nbspGrowth in the single currency area hit 2.7 per cent in 2017, the highest since 2006.\u0026nbspThe Brussels-based commission expects GDP growth in 2018 to slow to 2.1 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent in 2019 and 1.7 per cent in 2020. It blamed rising global uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade wars and higher international oil prices.“Uncertainty and risks, both external and internal, are on the rise and start to take a toll on the pace of economic activity. We need to stay vigilant and work harder to reinforce the resilience of our economies,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, commission vice-president for the euro, said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The historical legacy of this period is extremely sensitive for both countries and continues to impact their relationship: million of Koreans suffered during the occupation, while over 200,000 people died when the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\u0026nbspArguably the best-known exponents of K-pop\u0026nbspinternationally – the genre itself celebrated for its wild visuals, cutting-edge fashion and intricate choreography – BTS are the first Korean act to crack the US Top 40, hitting number 11 in August with their track “Idol”.

The European Commission – the heart of the Brussels empire, the “EUSSR”, – was always going to project a weak economic future for the UK post-Brexit, wasn’t it?A\u0026nbspgroup led by the malevolent Jean-Claude Juncker was\u0026nbspalways going to show the remaining 27 nations of the EU prospering while Britain, out of the club, stumbles helplessly.Such is the conspiratorial temper of our times that such reactions to the latest forecasts from the commission, showing precisely that, are sadly inevitable.UK set for weakest growth in Europe, European Commission warnsBut it’s still a silly conspiracy. For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from those of others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a withdrawal agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.The really important forecasts to bear in mind are those of a severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.On this credible economists and forecasters are united.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering onlineNo wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the High Street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 High Streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the Government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the Chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars Bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bette noir, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it. But even if you completely eliminated it the trend would likely continue, albeit perhaps at a slower rate.Britain\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspembraced internet shopping like almost no other nation, and that isn’t changing.\u0026nbspIt’s so much more convenient to have the retailer come to you\u0026nbspwhen the alternative is\u0026nbspslogging around the high street trailing children who’d rather be somewhere else and hoping you get finished\u0026nbspbefore the traffic wardens notice\u0026nbspyour car is illegally parked. Doubly so\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspyou’re time poor. Most Britons are. We\u0026nbspwork some of the longest hours in Europe.\u0026nbspPwC’s head of retail Lisa Hooker pointed out to me that 20 per cent of non food items are now bought online. The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the High Street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside ‘experience’ retailers like vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well. As have\u0026nbsp(hooray!) book and record shops\u0026nbspwhich have been\u0026nbspmaking a come back.Encouraging short term ‘pop up’ stores to open temporarily\u0026nbspalongside them them could help\u0026nbspdraw people in.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.”Nuclear waste could be buried underneath national parks, say MPsSue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, called the decision “devastating”.“Government has ultimate responsibility for ensuring a secure and stable supply of energy throughout the UK,” she said.“The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.“Our analysis shows that if the Government were to take a 50 per cent\u0026nbspstake then there would be a net benefit to the public purse, so there really is no excuse not to.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour supports Moorside as they see nuclear as a key part of the UK’s energy mix, but said the government should have stepped in to support it.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said Toshiba’s withdrawal was “entirely a commercial decision”.“Nuclear has an important role to play as part of the UK’s erse energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but in each case projects must provide value for money for consumers and taxpayers,” they said.“This government remains committed to new nuclear through the Industrial Strategy Nuclear Sector Deal as well as consenting the first new nuclear power station in a generation at\u0026nbspHinkley Point C.”Critics of nuclear power said the government should see the new circumstances\u0026nbspas an opportunity to move away from nuclear to cheaper technologies such as wind and solar power.“Shifting away from expensive, complicated technology towards cheaper and easier-to-build renewables gives the UK the opportunity to build an electricity system that will keep bills for homes and businesses down for years to come,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Cancelling Moorside does leave a gap in the UK’s decarbonisation plans, but one that is more likely to be filled with the technologies of the future rather than the past.”Additional reporting by PA.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK’s projected performance in 2020 is the weakest of the 28\u0026nbspnations currently in the bloc.\u0026nbspThe UK forecasts are worse than\u0026nbspthose made by the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility, which in last week’s Budget projected growth in 2019 of 1.6 per cent, followed by 1.4 per cent in 2020Bottom of the growth leagueThe commission also stressed that even its downbeat outlook was based on a “benign” scenario of UK trade with the rest of the European Union continuing uninterrupted.“The risks to the 2019 and 2020 baseline forecast are large, and predominantly to the downside”, the commission said.The commission said consumer confidence surveys suggested weak spending by households, adding Brexit uncertainty was likely to keep business investment “subdued”. It expects net trade to continue to drag on UK growth and sees the UK unemployment rate rising to 4.7 per cent by 2020, up from 4 per cent today.The commission projected the eurozone’s growth to slow too over the coming years.\u0026nbspGrowth in the single currency area hit 2.7 per cent in 2017, the highest since 2006.\u0026nbspThe Brussels-based commission expects GDP growth in 2018 to slow to 2.1 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent in 2019 and 1.7 per cent in 2020. It blamed rising global uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade wars and higher international oil prices.“Uncertainty and risks, both external and internal, are on the rise and start to take a toll on the pace of economic activity. We need to stay vigilant and work harder to reinforce the resilience of our economies,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, commission vice-president for the euro, said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In recent months, its price has been relatively stable and is currently trading at around $0.26 (£0.20), however Stellar\u0027s current transaction volume is less than 2 per cent of bitcoin\u0027s.Speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon on Tuesday, 6 November, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith explained his vision for spreading awareness and usage of cryptocurrency.We\u0027re doing this because we want you to truly\u0026nbspunderstand crypto, he told the audience.\u0026nbspAnd the only way to truly understand it is to use it.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But for cash-strapped countries like Pakistan, there are few alternatives, as\u0026nbspKim Sengupta\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followThe IndependentThe Chinese state holds a 99-year lease on the Sri Lankan port of HambantotaAn international conference took place last week in Gwadar, a dusty Pakistani town perched on the edge of the Indian Ocean –\u0026nbspan unlikely place, one would have thought, for Imran Khan’s government to invite dignitaries from 26 countries. But the real aim was to display a vision of the future – a mighty port city and commercial centre for the region which would put Dubai and Bahrain in the shade.Not everything went according to plan. While the delegates were being shown around the site of this projected\u0026nbspmega city, gunmen on motorcycles shot dead three workers and injured five others constructing homes in the suburbs for future residents. It was the fourth fatal shooting in the area in recent months\u0026nbspmore than three dozen builders had died in a series of attacks, with the Baloch Liberation Front, a group seeking an independent Balochistan,\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspheld responsible.The development of Gwadar is a matter of vital importance for a Pakistani government trying to rescue an economy which is\u0026nbspin dire straits. It has\u0026nbsprepeatedly claimed that violence in the area has been brought under control. On a trip to the town two weeks ago, however, my colleagues and I were only allowed to move around under army escort.Huge protests in Pakistan after Christian woman on death row releasedBut separatist strife is not the only issue with\u0026nbspGwadar. The port\u0026nbspis a prominent part of the $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\u0026nbsp(CPRC), which in turn is part of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative,\u0026nbspa massive and\u0026nbspcontroversial mission which has become a huge geopolitical talking point.To the Chinese government and its supporters, the Belt and Road\u0026nbspproject – set to be established in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe,\u0026nbspwith offshoots in Latin America –\u0026nbspis a purely strategic infrastructure programme which will spread trade and the benefit it brings across many lands.To its\u0026nbspgrowing number of detractors, the real aim is to spread Chinese\u0026nbsphegemony using commerce in tandem with the naval bases\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsp“String of Pearls”\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspBeijing is building on the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The covert motive, it is claimed, is to spread “debt-trap diplomacy”\u0026nbspby providing finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this so far is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn on loans.This is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with the bad publicity they are gettingChina is Islamabad’s long-term, staunch backer and is\u0026nbspincreasingly important – especially as a previous ally, the US, is now courting India, the country with which Pakistan has been locked in rivalry since both states became free from British colonial rule more than seven\u0026nbspdecades ago.There is also the crucial economic factor:\u0026nbspPakistan is greatly in need of money from its friends. Two weeks ago, the country’s new prime minister, Imran Khan told The Independent\u0026nbspin an interview about the stark reality of the financial situation. While many international political and business leaders had pulled out of an economic forum in Riyadh following the murder of\u0026nbspjournalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he had to go because, he admitted,\u0026nbsp“We are desperate for money ... The reason I have to take this opportunity is because we are a country of 210 million people and we have the worst debt crisis in our history.” Without funding from abroad, he pointed out, “we actually won’t have in another three months enough foreign exchange to service our debts or pay for our imports.”Imran Khan (second right)\u0026nbspattends\u0026nbspthe opening ceremony of the Future Investment Initiative\u0026nbspin Riyadh last month (AFPGetty)Khan wanted to attract investors at the forum to Pakistan. But the main aim was to secure Saudi largesse. Failure to get funds from the kingdom as well as from China would mean turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s 13th bailout – accompanied by\u0026nbspinevitably\u0026nbspharsh strictures on public spending, with the population already suffering from an austerity package.Khan secured a very welcome $6bn\u0026nbspfrom the Saudis after meeting the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the man who has been accused of being complicit in Jamal Khashoggi’s death (though he denies any knowledge). “It sounds callous, I know,”\u0026nbspsaid a senior official in Islamabad, “but this is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with all the bad publicity they are getting.”As well as the loan pledge, Pakistan got an agreement for Saudi Arabia to invest in a new oil refinery in Gwadar. A Saudi delegation visited the port and, according to petroleum minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan,\u0026nbsp“showed an interest to immediately invest in the refinery”. The agreement will be signed by the kingdom’s oil giant Aramco and the Pakistan State Oil company, but, he said, “we sat down and held discussions and it was principally decided by both sides that it will be a government to government agreement.”Gwadar can become a strategic port on the edge of the Indian Ocean (Amanda Coakley)This week Khan was on a trip to China during which he sought further funds to add to the $6bn Beijing has loaned Pakistan since last year to prop up its foreign exchange reserves. There were recriminations after Pakistan’s national television channel used a caption saying “begging” instead of “Beijing”. It was due to an unfortunate typographical error, the broadcaster said in its apology.Beijing is expected to acquiesce, but it has also repeated its call on Islamabad to carry out the type of structural reforms the IMF\u0026nbsphad also demanded in response to Pakistan’s latest appeal for help.There has also been annoyance in Beijing at criticism of the Belt and Road\u0026nbspfrom Pakistani officials, including Khan himself when he was in opposition, as well as two officials in his government. Abdul Razzak Dawood, an adviser to the prime minister on commerce, had held that some of the deals made were unfair to Pakistani companies. The railways minister, Sheikh Rashid, has wanted to cut the size of the Karachi-Peshawar rail line, saving $2bn from the $8bn budget.There are also claims, in Pakistan and abroad, that the Belt and Road\u0026nbspis one of the main contributors to Pakistan’s economic problems. Beijing has insisted that Pakistan buy Chinese equipment for projects, which has denuded foreign exchange reserves. Beijing has then extended loans to cover the purchases, which, in turn, has sent debt soaring further.AFPGetty)The IMF has insisted that any loan it gives to Pakistan is not used to pay off the China debt. The organisation’s managing director, Christine Lagarde,\u0026nbsphas stressed\u0026nbspthat there must be “absolute transparency” over this. The US, too, has demanded similar stipulations. Washington has long been hostile towards the Chinese project, charging that Beijing is using it to hold nations in thrall.Relations between the US and Islamabad are at a particularly low ebb\u0026nbspat present, in any case. Successive American presidents have threatened to cut aid to the Pakistani military unless action was taken against the Taliban and other violent Islamist groups which\u0026nbspthe west (and the Afghan government) claim are fed and watered in Pakistan and sent to carry out murderous attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan has always denied the allegation.Donald Trump’s first tweet this year said that the US “has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33bn\u0026nbspin aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies \u0026amp deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools”. The US administration announced in September that it was cutting $300m in aid to Pakistan’s military.The Chinese are concerned by armed insurgency across the border in Balochistan where they have been in confidential negotiations with rebel groups for some time. However, with the Gwadar plan, it is the possibility of being drawn into a wider confrontation, if Saudi Arabian investment\u0026nbspin the port is confirmed,\u0026nbspwhich is a cause of unease.Created with Sketch.

This is especially of concern as China is a major importer of Iranian oil, and has\u0026nbspbegun to invest heavily in Iran –picking up contracts being left behind by western companies pulling out after the reimposition\u0026nbspof sanctions by the Trump administration.Iran has experienced a number of terrorist attacks claimed by Isis which Tehran has blamed, without offering evidence, on Saudi Arabia. The scope for sectarian trouble\u0026nbspspreading to Balochistan was illustrated last month when 14 Iranian border guards were abducted by an extremist Sunni group Jaish al-Adli. Pakistani security forces say they have failed to find the kidnapped men, leading to warnings of action being taken by the Iranians.The Pakistani government has stressed that the Saudi money did not come with political strings attached and, in his interview\u0026nbspbefore he went to Riyadh, Imran Khan spoke of his regret at Mr Trump tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran and pursuing punitive measures against the country.Gwadar is a prominent part of a $60bn\u0026nbspinfrastructure project between China and Pakistan (Amanda Coakley)The prime minister said that Pakistan\u0026nbspwould like to be an intermediary between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yet the Saudi-led Sunni block were unhappy when the Pakistani parliament, under the previous government, refused to take part in the current war in Yemen. Islamabad was privately warned that it would have to choose sides sooner rather than later. There have long been reports that Saudi Arabia has “bought” a nuclear bomb from Pakistan to act as a counter against a “Shia bomb” produced by Iran – and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, set up by Riyadh and led by a Pakistani commander, General Raheel Sharif,\u0026nbspprimarily exists to counter Shia forces.According to Theodore Karasik, at Gulf State Analytics, a Washington consultancy firm, “Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s camp.”Robert Emerson, a British security consultant, says:\u0026nbsp“China have invested heavily in Pakistan, but it is also engaging in a substantial way commercially with Iran. It is understandable that they do not want to see a Saudi presence imported into Gwadar, just over a 100km\u0026nbspfrom the Iranian border.“But China also now has problems with Belt and Road. There has been consistent opposition from the US, Japan, India and others and now we see some of those countries which were going to take part in it are having second thoughts.”China urged to close mass detention camps for Uighur MuslimsPakistan to plant 10 billion trees to combat decades of deforestationPakistan invites Saudi Arabia to join China’s Belt and Road corridorA number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes. Recent elections in the Males saw the defeat of the Beijing-backed President Abdulla Yameen under whose rule the nation has accrued $1.3bn debt to China, more than a quarter of its GDP. The opposition – whose candidate, Mohamed Solih, won at the polls\u0026nbsp– had warned of being sucked into a “serious debt trap”.In Colombia there has been widespread local opposition for eight years to the building of the $4bn Ituango dam, part funded by the Chinese, in an area with propensity for landslides. This year 26,000 people had to be evacuated after heavy rainfall led to a landslide environmentalists have been warning about.Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s campIt has now been almost a decade since China overtook the US as Africa’s biggest trading partner. Nine countries have signed Belt and Road\u0026nbspagreements with Beijing and 20 others are engaged in talks to do so. The Chinese government pledged $60bn in preferential loans and investments at an economic forum for Africa three years ago.African countries, so far, have been readily receptive to the Chinese loans which have been pouring in. But concerns have been raised too,\u0026nbspwith the Centre for Global Development finding, for instance, that Djibouti, where the Chinese now have a military base, has seen its foreign debt swell from 50 per cent to 85 per cent of GDP with the largest amount by far owed to China. The Chinese company CMPort, the same one which built Hambantota in Sri Lanka, now under Chinese control, is building a port in the country at Doraleh.China also has aspirations for Europe to be the final destination for the land route of the Belt and Road, with the aim that every day trains from Chinese trading cities would arrive at distribution points in Duisburg, Madrid and London.But six months ago 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing\u0026nbspsigned off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.In September, Brussels launched its response to the Belt and Road: the building of infrastructure across Europe and Asia with Federica Mogherini, the head of European Union foreign policy, describing it as the “European way” of connecting the two continents.But the European Union may not remain unified in its approach. The Hungarian ambassador did not sign the report in Beijing and now Britain appears to be keen for China deals. In December last year Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, said, “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK\u0026nbspat the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”Like Imran Khan’s Pakistan, Theresa May’s post-Brexit Britain cannot ignore Beijing at a time of economic hardship, however the true cost of this Chinese connection will\u0026nbspunfold in the future.belt and roadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It didn\u0027t say when it would show off what the phone actually looks like or any other features.Samsung \u0027Galaxy X\u0027 foldable phone tablet to be unveiled this weekBut demonstrations on stage appeared to show the phone\u0027s screen working, shrinking when it was bent over on itself into the phone setup.And it said new screen technologies would allow it to run three apps at once.Samsung\u0027s announcement had already been somewhat spoiled by Google\u0027s announcement earlier in the day that it would be introducing support for folding devices into its Android operating system, and that it was working with Samsung to integrate them into its new phone.\u0026nbspAnd Samsung itself had suggested that it would have an announcement to make about the long-rumoured handset, a couple of days before the presentation.With the world\u0027s eyes on the announcement, the company spent a considerably amount of time talking about Bixby, its attempt at a voice assistant which has failed to reach the popularity of competitors like Alexa. But it then turned to the foldable phone, dimming the lights and giving a short demonstration of how it might work.Samsung has been teasing the development of the foldable phone for more than five years. It is far from the only company to be doing so, and its announcement looked to be overshadowed somewhat when another smaller firm called Royole announced that it would be releasing a foldable handset of its own.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.It was only after Professor Eske Willerslev of the University of Cambridge and his team conducted their genetic analysis that they were able to prove a connection with the modern tribe.“Spirit Cave and Lagoa Santa were very controversial because they were identified as so-called ‘Paleoamericans’\u0026nbspbased on craniometry\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit was determined that the shape of their skulls was different to current day Native Americans,” said Professor Willerslev​.\u0026nbsp“Our study proves that Spirit Cave and Lagoa Santa were actually genetically closer to contemporary Native Americans than to any other ancient or contemporary group sequenced to date.”With the results confirmed, the remains were returned to the tribe in 2016, where they were given a private reburial.A statement from the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe said they “had a lot of experience with members of the scientific community, mostly negative”.It added: “However, there are a handful of scientists that seemed to understand the tribe’s perspective and Eske Willerslev was one of them.\u0026nbspHis new study confirms what we have always known from our oral tradition and other evidence – that the man taken from his final resting place in Spirit Cave is our Native American ancestor.”By combining the wealth of evidence, the scientists revealed a story of ancient movement that ned millennia.European arrival in Americas wiped out native dogs alongside people“A striking thing about the analysis of Spirit Cave and Lagoa Santa is their close genetic similarity which implies their ancestral population travelled through the continent at astonishing speed,” said Dr David Meltzer from Southern Methodist University. “That’s something we’ve suspected due to the archaeological findings, but it’s fascinating to have it confirmed by the genetics.\u0026nbsp“These findings imply that the first peoples were highly skilled at moving rapidly across an utterly unfamiliar and empty landscape. They had a whole continent to themselves and they were travelling great distances at breath-taking speed.”The findings were published in the journal Science.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.By creating a “hybrid system”\u0026nbspthat encourages the mushrooms and bacteria to collaborate, the scientists think they have solved this problem.The systems were created by 3D printing an electronic ink containing strands of graphene, and then following this with a bio-ink containing the bacteria onto the cap of the mushroom.When light shone was on the mushroom, the bacteria began to photosynthesise and a tiny current of about 65 nanoamps passed into the network of graphene.While the scientists think an array of these mushrooms would be enough to power something like an LED light, they are still way off powering larger electronic devices.With this work, we can imagine enormous opportunities for next-generation bio-hybrid applications, said Professor Mannoor.\u0026nbspFor example, some bacteria can glow, while others sense toxins or produce fuel.\u0026nbsp“By seamlessly integrating these microbes with nanomaterials, we could potentially realise many other amazing designer bio-hybrids for the environment, defence, healthcare and many other fields.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Chequers-type deal, as I say, if we don’t have friction with trade, then, economically, I don’t think it’s going to make a particular big difference one way or the other.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt delivers a speech at the British embassy in Paris.

When international trade secretary Liam Fox was asked on Thursday if a “mutually agreed withdrawal” from the backstop was acceptable, he suggested it would fail to deliver the “instruction from our voters” given by the referendum.“That decision can’t be subcontracted to somebody else – that needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine,” he insisted.Cabinet members have demanded to see the legal advice the government has received on the mechanism, with one source telling The Independent ministers want to be sure there are no other credible options from a legal point of view.hiccups‘ in coming year if Britain fails to reach deal with EU“There is sense that ministers have been given a verbal brief, but they want to see it written on paper. Verbal briefs have been known to change.”Another cabinet level source said: “We need to be able to see in black and white that there is no other way. If it turns out that there is, and what the PM has been saying is a political, not a legal, argument, then there might well be a disagreement on Monday.”Ms May will also have to convince her Northern Irish partners in government that the review mechanism and the backstop more generally meets their requirements.But DUP MP Sammy Wilson poured cold water on it on Thursday, telling The Independent: “The review mechanism is not something which she’s going to get past her party let alone ourselves.“It leaves the final decision partly in the hands of the EU and that is never something that will be to the advantage of the UK.“The EU will always find reasons and excuses to maintain the continuous backstop, the idea of the mechanism in itself is an excuse to keep us in the backstop indefinitely – that’s the reason that the full legal advice has been sought by ministers and ourselves.”“It’s totally blinkered to the domestic difficulties, it doesn’t deliver on the premises that she has set out, which requires a totally different mindset.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This\u0026nbspwould effectively keep Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels’\u0026nbspcustoms union and single market, the letter is said to suggest.In the letter, seen by\u0026nbspThe Times, Ms May reportedly says: “I am clear that I could not accept there being any circumstances or conditions in which that ‘backstop to the backstop’, which would break up the UK customs territory, could come in to force.”EU heaps pressure on Theresa May ahead of crunch talksYet the DUP has interpreted the\u0026nbspwording to mean that the sea border clause would still be written into the orce agreement, the paper reported.Ms\u0026nbspFoster said in a statement: “The prime minister’s letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the UK.“It appears the prime minister is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish sea with Northern Ireland in the EU single market regulatory regime.”Ms May has been battling to agree a orce deal with the EU that can satisfy Brussels, her own party and the\u0026nbspDUP, whose 10 votes she will likely need to get the agreement through the House of Commons.Asked by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwhether the letter explicitly said the\u0026nbsp“backstop to the backstop” would be included in any Brexit agreement, a Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment.Number 10 said in a statement:\u0026nbsp“The prime minister’s letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories.“The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The barriers are mostly focused on keeping out undocumented migrants and would-be refugees.The erection of the barriers has also coincided with the rise of xenophobic parties across the continent, with 10 out of 28 seeing such parties win more than half a million votes in elections since 2010.“Europe’s own history shows that building walls to resolve political or social issues comes at an unacceptable cost for liberty and human rights,” Nick Buxton, researcher at the Transnational Institute and editor of the report said.Men convicted of plotting to bomb Muslim refugees blame Trump, RussiaHow refugees in Paris have become the ‘perfect prey’ for drug dealers Calais child refugees refused by Home Office ‘being exploited in UK’“Ultimately it will also harm those who build them as it creates a fortress that no one wants to live in. Rather than building walls, Europe should be investing in stopping the wars and poverty that fuels migration.”Tens of thousands of people have died trying to migrate into Europe, with one estimate from June this year putting the figure at over 34,000 since the EU’s foundation in 1993. A total of 3,915 fatalities were recorded in 2017.The report also looked at eight EU maritime rescue operations launched by the bloc, seven of which were carried out specifically by the EU’s border agency Frontex.Created with Sketch.Refugee crisis - in pictures Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A child looks through the fence at the Moria detention camp for migrants and refugees at the island of Lesbos on May 24, 2016.

The flow of migrants arriving in Passau has dropped to between 500 and 1,000 per day, down significantly from last November, when in the same region up to 6,000 migrants were arriving daily.The researchers found that none of the operations, all conducted in the Mediterranean, had the rescue of people as their principal goal – with all of them focused on “eliminating criminality in border areas and slowing down the arrival of displaced peoples”.Just one, Operation Mare Nostrum, which was carried out by the Italian government, included humanitarian organisations in its fleets. It has since been scrapped and replaced by Frontex’s Operation Triton, which has a smaller budget.“These measures lead to refugees and displaced peoples being treated like criminals,” Ainhoa Ruiz Benedicto, researcher for Delàs Center and co-author of the report said.At the June European Council, EU leaders were accused by NGOs of “deliberately condemning vulnerable people to be trapped in Libya, or die at sea”, after they backed the stance of Italy’s populist government and condemned rescue boats operating in the sea.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Brexit news: Language tutoring SOARS as UK gears up for global market                \u0026lsquoEUROPE IS FRAGILE\u0026rsquo Barnier warns EU must fight to DEFEND itselfAides stressed none of the events was intended to have a Brexit focus.But they are timely as Mrs May races to overcome the final obstacles to agreeing Britain\u0027s orce terms from the EU.Speculation of progress was fuelled by claims of a draft British timetable circulating where the UK Cabinet would meet on Monday to approve a draft withdrawal deal.This would include the backstop agreement keeping the UK in the EU\u0027s customs union if needed to ensure cross-border trade remains free-flowing between Northern Ireland and Ireland after Brexit.Theresa May is to meet the EU leaders tonight (Image: Getty)Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are expected to meet (Image: Dursun AydemirAnadolu AgencyGetty Images)Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab would meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels and the withdrawal agreement and outline future partnership paper would be published on Tuesday and Mrs May would present the deal to MPs on Wednesday.An Austrian newspaper quoted EU Commission sources saying there could then be a special EU leaders\u0027 summit on November 25 to approve the deal.Asked about the chances of a deal in the next week, Mr Tusk told Channel 4 News: I hope so ... but still we need five, maybe six, maybe seven days.A Downing Street source stressed no agreement had been reached nor Cabinet meeting scheduled.President of the European Council Donald Tusk said they need a few more days (Image: Roni RekomaaBloomberg Getty Images)We are still in negotiations, and on that basis we don\u0027t know when and if this will conclude, they said, also urging people to treat European media reports of a deal in days with a very large pinch of salt.Aides have warned that devising a Northern Ireland backstop which satisfies the EU while assuring worried ministers and MPs that Britain could not be trapped permanently in the customs union is highly complex.But there are also claims Mrs May needs agreement by Monday for there to be a special summit of EU leaders this month.This would give her more time to get the deal through Parliament by Christmas than if she has to wait for the routine mid-December EU meeting to rubber stamp it.But one unnamed senior EU official was quoted warning: A deal is certainly not done.

A new voter later in the year, however, returned an independentist majority to power.The struggle between the pro-independence groups in Catalonia and the Spanish government fighting to keep the country together continues.Mr Fraser suggested Scotland\u0027s budget deficit could further trigger a rejection for European Union membership from member states for the independent nation.He continued: It is questionable whether an independent Scotland would meet the criteria for EU membership. An independent Scotland would carry a budget deficit in excess of 9 percent of the GDP, which is well above the EU average.Brexit news: Mr Fraser argued EU member states will not want to take a risk with Scotland\u0027s deficit (Image: \u0026bullYOUTUBEThe Wellbeing Academy)Much worse than Greece has been. Whether the other European countries would want a new member that has such serious budget deficit is an open question.The Scottish MSP also argued an independent Scotland would lose the benefits of the opt-outs the United Kingdom enjoyed ahead of Brexit, resulting in the probable membership of the eurozone.Mr Fraser added: An independent Scotland joining the EU would have to sing up to all the requirements of full-single market membership for which the UK had secured opt-outs, for example on the budget rebate, on the Schengen agreement and, most crucially, on membership of the euro.I don\u0026rsquot think the path of an independent Scotland into the heart of the EU would be by any means an easy one.

The outcome will have to be a choice that the people of Scotland will have to make between Brexit and another future. There\u0026rsquos no other future but independence in those circumstances.\u0026ldquoWhen we get to the stage that it\u0026rsquos Brexit or independence, people will have to be asked that question. I don\u0026rsquot know when that will be \u0026ndash but I do not doubt that will have to happen.

Robbie was meant to be Simon Cowell, but looked a lot more like Big Bob Joylove from Harry Enfield And Chums, and Cowell himself was swathed in bandages ashe’d fled the Cedars-Sinai clinic halfway through a facelt.However much the outfits managed expectations, though, nothing could quite prepare you for the contestants, who seem to spend at least as much time preparing their sob stories as their singing.Scarlett Lee should’ve had the head start on everyone here, of course, after her brother’s home was incinerated and she “burnt her eye” in a salvage attempt.But Danny Tetley, who can dissolve into a sobbing wreck at the mere mention of bereavement, is the one giving a lesson to everyone, especially -year-old Giovanni Spano,he thinks we’re going to buy his “chubby teenager” torment for a second.No matter how much they spin and sob, though, nothing can quite take the edge off the singing, where this week’s race to the bottom was won by United Vibe’s version of Bleeding Love. “You cut me open and I keep bleeding.” My ears keep bleeding.The great thing about this lot, though, was that everyone thought the real problem was their name and kept insisting “You need to change it”, to something more viewer-friendly, like The Tinnitus , Tone-Def, The Backstreet Abortions, Hamas, anything but United Vibe.That problem went away, obviously, when they were eliminated on Sunday.However, the only thing anyone will remember about last weekend’s X Factor is the technical gremlin that struck,  minutes into Saturday’s pre-record, and made Danny and Anthony Russell sound like they were singing through a Dalek filter.Personally, I didn’t think it harmed their performances one little bit, yet after two hours of wailing and sobbing, up popped the message: “Tonight’s vote is cancelled.”It’s the last thing the show needed, clearly, as it’s already holed below the waterline and everything’s now going down with the ship.Everything except perhaps the unsinkable ego of Robbie Williams, who was still busy assuring Scarlett Lee, “In five years’ time, we’ll be on the same Christmas show together”, where Robbie will be working as a stage-hand called “Esteban” on Feliz Navidad Paraguay.“We’ll have a cuddle,” and then Robbie will whisper in Scarlett’s ear “You don’t know me.

What I hadn’t bargained on was that Joey wouldn’t be the dimmest person on set.That honour went to host Vick Hope, off Strictly, who distinguished herself early on by asking magician Ben: “What is a lock pick ”“It’s a pick that picks locks,” dumbo.She also tried introducing Diags, off Towie, as the show’s resident doctor, Ed Hope, and had a way of killing the mystery and tension that was quite hypnotic: “They’ll have to pick locks like their lives depend on it . . . ’cos they do . . . well, they kind of do.”If there’s one thing I’ll take from this show, though, it’s Vick’s final health and safety disclaimer.“It goes without saying,” she said, “don’t lock your head in a box of water, don’t handcuff yourself and don’t throw yourself in a lake.”Although, rule out none of the aboveLive And Deadly: Drowned comes back this time next year.Martin Keown: “Gambling is a gamble.”Dion Dublin: “Neil Lennon’s no shrieking violet.”And Alan McInally: “An hour gone and Manchester United haven’t been anywhere near the pitch.”.In these tearful, snowflake-ridden times, the most important and le-affirming television of the week was Wednesday’s The One Show.Other guests were present but, like every single viewer, they will have been transfixed by the remarkable Doddie Weir, the former Scotland rugby lock, in the shortbread tin suit, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease two years ago.Very calmly he explained exactly how this was in the process of killing him, before, with the classic understatement of a man from the Scottish Borders – an area not big on over-sharing – Doddie said: “It’s not the best disease to happen.”There were none of the tears we’ve all come to expect in these situations, though, or any sense of self pity, because big Doddie is too busy pushing back, organising his charity events and doing the most important thing of all in these or any other circumstances.Grabbing le by the throat and getting on with the simple joy of living. mynamedoddie.Sophie: “Popeye.”Bradley Walsh: “Witches are most often depicted flying on what object ”Keisha: “UFOs.”Tipping Point: “Found on boxes of cognac, the letters XO stand for Extra what ”Tracey: “Alcohol.”And Bradley Walsh: “What rock ’n’ roll star drove a truck for Crown Electric before he was famous ”Catherine: “Rock Hudson.”AND INTERRUPTION OF THE WEEK...Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Fixodent is an adhesive used to keep in place...”BZZZZZZ.

According to new polling by YouGov, only three per cent of us think we aren’t handing the taxman enough — and just  per cent that most people pay too little.It’s hardly surprising. For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work. But people will only workit pays them to do so.The job for the politicians is to make damn sure it does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One female onlookershrieks, “Help me! Help me!” as the others laugh, while someone  boasts: “I made the burning people.”It’s not just that it’s shockingly distasteful, it’s the sheer callousness of it that renders one almost speechless with disbelief.Then there’s the group of lads in their late teens who thought it funny to spit at Janice Morris as she sat alone on a park bench, before later pelting her with flour and eggs.When police — who class her as vulnerable and with mental health issues — visited her Suffolk home later that day, they found her still covered in flour and with “smudged mascara down her face”.One of the gang — -year-old Cohan Semple — saw fit to take a photo of the attack and posted it on Snapchat.One recipient reposted it to Facebook, it went viral and, quite rightly, prompted widespread revulsion and a police investigation.All five have pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour which caused harassment, alarm or distress and await sentencing.Meanwhile, it seems “dozens” of the Remembrance Day “Silent Silhouette” statues placed all over the country have been defaced or smashed up by mindless vandals. In Devon alone, one statue was snapped in half, another five vandalised and one stolen.Oh how we wish that,caught in the act, their punishment could be a few weeks on the frontline of a war zone. But don’t hold your breath.Instead, let’s focus on the good in society that, thankfully, still forms the majority. The thousands who expressed their abject disgust at the breathtakingly inhumane bonfire stunt, the horried locals in Bury St Edmunds who helped police locate Miss Morris and bring her tormentors to justice, and the noble volunteers who, seeing the damage to the Silent Silhouette statues, stepped in to repair them in time for this weekend’s Remembrance Sunday.Volunteers such as a group of teenagers in Axminster, Devon, who took a vandalised “Tommy” in to their school workshop and repaired him.Placing him back at the scene afterwards, they laid a wreath and declared: “We are here today to show you that we, as young people, do care.“We care about the sacrices made by the brave men and women who fought for our country.”So let’s take comfort that the true measure of British society lies in their actions and not those of a few morons.“Dry Martini service trolley”, anyone  Nope, me neither.As for the hand-stitched couture Valentino gown, the site describes it as “a dress that defies adjectives”.Oh, I don’t know. “Bloody expensive” comes to mind.MODEL and self-publicist extraordinaire Emily Ratajkowski has published this photo with the caption: “Laundry day.”Cripes.

In the interests of clarity, one should perhaps point out the bag was for the dog, not Ant himself.

Buttheres No Deal, then things could get tricky.Ministers are still working on getting a crucial agreement signed soon, but they could have to implement emergency plans in just days time. What should you know about getting ready for your holidays As part of plans to get ready for No Deal, it was recommended that Brits with less than a year left on their passport get theirs renewed sooner rather than later.Ministers said British people will need to have a passport which is valid for at least six monthsthey want to visit the EU.After we quit the EU our passports will be a navy blue colour, not the current burgundy red.Gloomy Phil Hammond got the nation panicking when he said that under No Deal, planes could be grounded between Britain and the EU. Its a warning thats been repeated by countless politicians since, including the EUs Jean Claude Juncker.Britain would no longer be in the EUs single aviation market, and flights to other countries with which the EU has a deal would also be affected.New agreements can be negotiated, but they could take a while.Airlines are confident that flights will continue to take off regardless - EasyJet and British Airways have said an agreement will be put in place, but Ryanair has been a little more cautious and has begun warning passengers on tickets that it cant be guaranteed.Trains will still run after Brexit, of course. But there are no guarantees that Eurotunnel wont have any disruption next year.As part of a raft of No Deal notices last month, the Government said that companies such as Eurostar, which only holds a UK licence, could be affected unless inidual agreements are struck with the countries it goes to.It advises taking out insurance for Eurostar tickets that cover any Brexit disruption.Under No Deal, UK driving licences would no longer be valid in the EU so holidaymakers would need to buy an international driving permit, available at the Post Office for £..The Government said: You may be turned away at the border or face other enforcement action, for example fines,you don’t have the correct IDP.And you could need a Green card  too - a translation of your car insurance policy - which you can get from the Post Office.But providing ministers secure the -month transition period as planned, this should stay the same.Holidaymakers are delaying booking their ferry crossings for next summer because of Brexit fears, Brittany Ferries said earlier this week, with bookings down  per cent.Dover to Calais and other ferry routes could be impactedchecks have to be made at borders in the event of a No Deal Brexit.But there are unlikely to be any extra delays for tourists, as Brits already get their passports checked en route anyway.No changes should be needed for anyone booking a package deal - unless your booking is with an EU-based firm and made outside the UK, in which case you may not be protected.There was a drop in the pound after Britain voted to leave the EU, meaning Brits will have to stump up more money to get their euros when going abroad on the continent.Buttheres a Brexit deal signed in the next few weeks, the pounds value could increase and make next years a bit cheaper again. A No Deal could see it drop again, pushing up prices.Brits will be able to continue to enjoy free healthcare when travelling in Europe after Brexit, it was confirmed last year.As part of the Withdrawal Agreement, officials have negotiated to use the European Health Insurance Cardacross EU’s  remaining member states – not just the country they’re living in.Pet owners should speak to a vet as soon as possiblethey want to take their animals to Europe after Brexit, Britains top vet warned earlier this week.Brits will need to pay up to £ for the right to take pets on holidaywe leave the EU with No Deal.If we do get a deal in the next few weeks it should be able to continue as normal.Most UK networks say they have no plans to bring back roaming charges after we leave the EU.The bloc scrapped them last year, but there have been fears it could cost more to call and use the internet abroad in future.Ministers have said that any increases again would be limited.Brits could be forced to apply for US-style waivers after Brexit to go on their hols, Theresa May has admitted.Unveiling plans last month to pre-screen EU tourists as part of her new post-Brexit immigration policy, the Prime Minister conceded the arrangements were likely to have to be “reciprocal”.The US currently charges  for every ‘ESTA’ waiver form – raising the prospects Brits will be forced to shell out each time they want to fly to the Costa del Sol.The EU are set to decide within weeks whether the Brits will need a visa in the event of No Deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447559815.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bikelife bikestormz army gangs","story":"Bikestormz - a collection of thrill-seeking young cyclists up and down Britain - is fighting back with the motto BikesUpKnivesDown.Their intervention couldnt come at a more critical time. This week, a boy of  became Britains th stabbing victim this year - and the nations kne crime epidemic has stretched public faith to breaking point.With police and politicians seemingly at a loss with how to stem the flow of blood on Britains streets, the bike community is desperately trying to prove that you can get a bigger adrenaline rush from cycling than crime.Founded in  by Mac Ferrari, a reformed roadman - a young wannabe gangster - at Bikestormzs last London ride out in August police held up traffic, blocked junctions and even cycled alongside the ,-strong mob in an attempt to limit the chaos.Ferrari, a softly-spoken -year-old explains: I have lost too many people I grew up with to murder to prison, he says.Over nine years I lost  friends to gun and kne crime. My best friend was shot dead in a nightclub when I was standing next to him.Others were sent to jail for all kinds of stuff – murder, robbery, drugs. So I wanted to tell the kids to put the kne down and do something more positive.I was tired of people glamorising the lestyle of crime.I wanted to show them you don’t need to get the adrenaline rush from crime you can get the same buzz from riding your bike. Now Bikestormz is like our church.However, unlike kne-wielding, drug-fuelled gangs that force youngers to break the law to progress up a vicious pecking order, this new obsession is saving lives and keeping kids out of serious trouble, Ferrari claims.Anyone who can peddle hard enough to keep up is welcome – no matter their background. Respect is gained by a rider’s skill and range of cycling tricks, rather than their police record.Authority is established through a series of regular skill events. Fighting is not tolerated. Rude and aggressive behaviour is sanctioned... and already, thousands have been inspired to get off their backsides into the saddle.Incredibly, some riders even say that the bike group has brought peace to London estates which were previously at war with each other.Kizzy, an elite rider, , says Bikestormz has even brought peace to warring South London estates.I used to live in Peckham and there was no way I could go to Brixton without someone attacking me,’ he explains.But when you are on your bike there is no problem.When you are riding no one cares where you are from. We are all together. There is something really positive about  or  of us riding together.’Kizzy, a former Deliveroo rider from south London, says he never carried a kne but lots of kids around him did.When I was young I was a right little s**t – stealing bikes, getting into trouble with the police, bad stuff.But after I got into Bikestormz I wised up. And I know so many people who have put down their knives and got into riding. That’s what it’s all about – doing something positive.Founder Mac had already established a reputation as a stunt motorcycle rider when he got back onto his peddle bike and gained followers for the tricks he posted on Instagram.But he could never have expected to find  young riders raring to go when he organised his first ride out from Tower Bridge – an event now immortalised as Bikestormz.I expected about  kids to come together. When I got there, there were . And I was responsible for them all. It was terrying!I told themthere is any fighting there will not be a Bikestormz. And it all went off peacefully. Now we have grown into a massive family.It gives the kids something to occupy themselves. When they are not riding they are doing up and fixing their bikes.Some kids are rude to drivers and pedestrians when we are out but I tell them to stop it. I don’t put up with road rage.Bikestormz represents the UK version of the bike-riding craze known as #Bikele, which was born in the ghettos of Baltimore and Philadelphia.Now the Bikestormz movement has grown into a nationwide phenomenon with kids pulling wheelies and riding in groups up and down the country whenever they have free time.They gather in large groups in parks and quiet roads in industrial estates at weekends or ride around their local area like a mobile gang. Riders join the pack as they see it roll past.They can also be seen practicing tricks on their own or in groups after school wherever there is space.Riding down stairs – no matter how steep or long – is popular too.Meanwhile, bike trick competitions are held in the parks and waste ground in South London throughout the summer.The top riders are selected to join a select group called Street Elite. They are chosen their skills but also or their responsible attitude.To be selected for Street Elite you’ve got to show a good example to the other riders, explains Montana, an -year-old from Lewisham, south-east London.Bikestormz has been a good influence on me. It has kept me away from trouble.Where I live there is a lot of crime and drugs.But riding is a positive thing. Some days I ride from midday until ten o’clock at night. I love it.I first heard about Bikestormz after it started up. I went to a ride out and I haven’t looked back. It has helped me steer away from crime.Founder Mac and his elite riders attract tens of thousands of Instagram follower and get free bikes, trainers and other merch [merchandise] from sponsors.Kizzy added: Being in Street Elite gives us much more exposure.We get bikes from Mafiabikes, trainers from Nike and we have started music videos for London rappers like JME and Macstar.Wheelie Kay@wheelie_kay .k followersFrom the age of nine I started learning how to wheelie, but it was quite hard, so I left it at that. When I ride with my music it just gives me a lot of energy and people love that.Little Harry@littleharry .k followersAs I got older, around , I started watching loads of dferent people on the internet and realisedI keep on practicing I could be like them one day. For me it’s not a hobby, it’s a lestyle and I love what I do.Jake@jake .k followersI’m  and have been riding since I can remember, I’m filled with adrenaline by wheeling through the tightest gaps and going at high speed through traffic!It’s an amazing feeling being surrounded by hundreds of people how share the same passion as you.Ruby@_rubybailey .k followersI have been riding since [I was] two years old. I’m Street Elite’s first girl rider.Riding has become a massive part of my le and I can definitely see a future in it for me.StreeteliteridersThe London traffic will once again be brought to a standstill by teenagers cycling five abreast when the group go out on their next ride out on Christmas Eve.No one knows exactly how many young men and women will turn up at the Tower Bridge starting line at pm on th December.No route has been planned but the cycle caravan will certainly pass Buckingham Palace, go through Hyde Park, possibly down Oxford and even roll on into the City of London.

Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help. And that means that, for now, it’s down to us.We have a choice. We do not have to let our children use their services.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After more than a decade of operations in the Middle East – and amid rising tension with Russia – the huge show of strength sends “an important message to our potential adversaries”, one senior officer told the Mirror. Exercise Trident Juncture’s massive field training exercise involving  countries started in eastern Norway on October  and concluded on Wednesday, with command centre training due to finish later this month. The stated goal was to test the NATO alliance’s defence capability and neighbouring Russia’s response was to threaten to launch its own missiles off the Norwegian coast.  Russian observers took up NATO’s invitation to visit the exercise, which came a month after Russia carried out its own training exercise, the largest since the Cold War. Army bosses say any nation looking to make an enemy of a NATO member state will have been deterred by the massive collective presence on show. They say the exercise was about getting back to basics “to be a winning Army” as the conflict in the Middle East peters out. NATO pointed out that there is a “changing security environment” after Afghanistan, with a sht away from extremist threats to what one senior British officer described as “state-based threats”. The field training involved large-scale vehicle movement and service personnel using camouflage kit and living off ration packs in temperatures as low as -C.  A “battle” began on October  between NATO forces, with the UK at the helm, and an enemy played by Norwegian, German and Swedish forces. Brigadier Oliver Stokes was in command of  Multinational Brigade which comprised UK, Polish and Danish soldiers. Asked about Russia’s frosty response to the exercise, he said: “I don’t think we necessarily wanted to get into a cycle of response and counter-response. “My focus is here and on getting better at what we do. It’s for others to conclude the response,any, that’s required. But being able to march across Europe to get here and execute an exercise in this demanding climate is a pretty good demonstration of NATO’s collective deterrent. “I think NATO has made its point. The best way to prevent a threat is to deter it in the first place.” He added: “Threats to our security are no longer just non-state, such as the threat from extremism. It’s also state-based threats and the challenge to what we would describe as the accepted world norms of behaviour.” Tensions between the West and Russia have been rising steadily since President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea in , and were heightened further this year with the Salisbury novichok poisonings.  Brigadier Stokes said the Army is partly going “back to what it used to know” by using systems and tactics that “stand the test of time”. The force’s ability to get into position in bulk provided a huge show of power. Over five days at the start of October, around  Army vehicles travelled , miles from Scotland to Norway, passing through the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The Light Brigade Support Group, which co-ordinated the huge move, says it will be ready to deploy en masse at  days’ notice from January . Major Brian Bloomfield said: “I’ve been around for  years and have never done anything on this scale. The message is clear – we have a force that can respond rapidly.” Brigadier Stokes, an Army veteran of  years, said it was the largest exercise he and many others had taken part in.  “There is a need to train for large-scale war,” he told the Mirror. “Doing it at scale sends an important message to our potential adversaries. The message is simply: ‘We can do this.’ The nation wants the Army to be a winning army and that’s what we’re out here to do. “This exercise has been humbling. The soldiers have been fantastic. “At the start of the exercise they were operating in -C. On the night of deployment we went into every territory with heavy snow falling. “That then turns to mush and ice, which soldiers are lying down in. We’ve now got a foot in those conditions.” While Army chiefs avoided pointing the finger directly at Russia, troops on the ground said that among them it was “common knowledge” the Kremlin was the reason for the show of strength. One said: “Russia’s the reason behind all of this, we all know that.” Our reporters experience in the bitter cold The Mirror joined troops in the village of Akrestrommen to witness the huge operation in full flow. We bedded down with troops in an ice rink-turned army base in bitter temperatures. Days before we arrived, soldiers spent nights soaking wet as melting snow dripped through the roof. One Captain told us it was essential for Our Boys and Girls to get back to soldiering basics, with many of them having only operated in the Middle East. We joined them living on ration packs for our stay and managed a couple of hours sleep. The following day we headed an hour north to Battle Group Headquarters to embed on an all night mission. We joined up with Anzio company, a light role infantry of the Duke of Lancaster Regiment. At pm in the pitch black we were strapped into a troop carrier vehicle - a truck designed for use in Afghanistan but has now been painted green and is back on the road in Europe. It was a slow, bumpy, cold journey. The British Forces’ famous humour kept us in good spirits. The close-knit group sang songs and joked “we’re going to war” as we ground to a halt. But it was no laughing matter once boots hit the ground and their countless hours of training kicked in. We followed in tow over undulating, icy ground as temperatures plummeted well below zero. The troops were ordered frequently to stop, and they would disappear into the icy undergrowth for up to an hour, before re-emerging and pushing on. We were in safe hands with the well-drilled crew for around six hours, wading our way through forestry and open fields as the mist descended and left us with zero visibility. Our company swept unnoticed through fields hunting for hidden enemies as their accompanying heavy duty tanks, trucks and lorries whizzed by. Previous missions had seen them heavily engage with enemy troops but we heard only a few gunshots as the British-led force took an all-important bridge with relative ease to draw to a close a brutal, exhausting two-week-long battle game for our frozen soldiers. To witness the regiment’s skill, organisation and reassurance first hand was an eye-opener. Although a training exercise, many troops have not witnessed anything on this scale or in this challenging climate in their careers. “It’s a show of power, clearly” one told me. “Sorry you didn’t get to see any action tonight – but, that’s war.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heroes armed only cameras who","story":"NewsHeroes armed only with cameras who braved front line of First World WarThe photographers, many who worked for The Daily Mirror, chronicled the horrors of the war in a series of groundbreaking imagesShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsMirror man David McLellan with a camera, specially adapted for aerial pictures - circa  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey lay in mud-filled trenches as German shells rained down and dodged bullets and gas attacks, like every fighting man.

And on Sunday, as the nation marks the centenary of the  Armistice, the Mirror will honour its brave men with a beacon-lighting ceremony. We will be joined by relatives of four of our heroes – David McLellan and the three Grant brothers, Tom, Horace and Bernard.  Londoner David joined the Royal Flying Corps in  and helped set up its air reconnaissance unit. In December , at , he was made an official war photographer and went to the Western Front. While capturing the huge scale of operations he also found the inidual, human stories – British soldiers helping a French priest in the rubble of his church and portraits of terried German soldiers. In October , when the North Staffordshire Regiment seized the vital Riqueval Bridge, thousands of Tommies sat on what had been the German-controlled eastern bank while their commander addressed them. David’s shot of the scene remains one of the most famous of the war. His great-granddaughter Bianca Bowles, , from Mill Hill, said: “He was serving his country just as much as the troops – fighting for the truth to be told. “When I think of the risks my great-grandfather took and the images he captured, it makes me very proud.” Tom Grant also risked le and limb, and is considered a pioneer of press photography. He was the eldest of three brothers from London’s East End employed by the Mirror.  On the day war broke out in August , Tom, Horace and Bernard were holidaying on the south coast and headed straight to Belgium. Tom covered the Siege of Antwerp, leaving on the last boat before the Germans entered the city in October. In  he enlisted and became Britain’s official photographer in Salonika . And in May , he was on French ship SS Sontay when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat.  She went down in four minutes with the loss of  lives – and Tom, who made it into a leboat, took pictures. He later wrote: “I only had a short time before the ship sank. The last moments were awful... an unforgettable roar. “The captain was splendid. Just before the end he scrambled up to the highest point of the stern. ‘Vive la France!’ he cried defiantly, waving his cap, and that was the last we saw of him.” Meanwhile, Horace went to the south of France and captured images of Indian troops from the rdDivision being welcomed by locals in Orleans and Marseilles in September .  And youngest brother Bernard summed up the le of a war photographer in memoirs To The Four Corners. He wrote: “I have never ceased to wonder at the things that I, and numbers of other Fleet Street men, were able to do in those early days of the War. We used to motor out in search of photographs, often passing into No Man’s Lands. Why we were never captured will forever be a mystery, but was almost entirely a matter of luck.” Mirror man Ernest Brooks was the first and longest-serving British war photographer and took , images on the Western Front, in Italy and at Gallipoli. An officer who knew him said: “Brooks has no nerves. Day after day he goes poking his camera’s nose into places which any normal man would shun by as many miles as possible.”  And Ivor Castle took some  photographs between  and . They included pictures of the first tank, which the Mirror published in November . He was gassed at the Somme in  and suffered chest problems until his death in . He wrote: “My first plate was taken as the shell struck the ground. I guessed wrongly that it was a tear shell. “In another instant a slight whf made me very sick, brought pains in the chest, and excruciating dficulty in breathing.”  Our other brave staffers were George Mewes, who joined the Grants in Belgium and later travelled to Russia as an official snapper with the Russian army William Rider-Rider, assigned to Canadian troops and Armando Console, who also served on the Western Front as an shyofficial war photographer.You can order the -page magazine Armistice – A Century of Commemoration for pound. plus PP from Key Publishing by visiting shop.keypublishing or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit news theresa back border","story":"NewsBrexit news: Theresa May set to back a border in the Irish sea DUP letter suggestsThe PM has been accused of a \"total betrayal\" by the Northern Irish partyShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe Irish border has been the sticking point in the negotiations \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May was accused of a “total betrayal” amid claims she is set to back a Brexit border in the Irish Sea. The Prime Minister has written to the DUP , triggering fears she will cave into Brussels demands for a Northern Ireland-only backstop to the backstop in case of a no-deal exit.In the letter, obtained by The Times, Mrs May said: I am clear that I could not accept there being any circumstances or conditions in which that backstop to the backstop, which would break up the UK customs territory, could come in to force. The DUP believes the wording means the measure will be included in the Brexit orce deal - despite Mrs Mays insistence it will never come into effect.DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “The Prime Ministers letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the UK. It appears the Prime Minister is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea with Northern Ireland in the EU single market regulatory regime.The DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson accused Mrs May of a “total betrayal”, claiming she had broken “promises she made.”  Meanwhile, the EU is set to demand ongoing access to UK fishing waters while Britain remains in the customs union as the price of a UK-wide backstop called for by the PM. One EU diplomat said: “It is paramount the UK gives assurances on the access of the European fleet to UK waters before the EU can agree to a U.K.-wide backstop.” Another told the : “There can be a customs union, but there must be rules to ensure that EU fishermen will be able to continue to fish in UK waters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"culture secretary reveals very large","story":"NewsCulture Secretary reveals he has a very large collection of Lego to help him unwindHe said his we would say his collection of plastic bricks is \"too large\"ShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  NOV NewsHe finds the building blocks therapeutic \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCulture Secretary Jeremy Wright has revealed he has a very large collection of Lego, which he uses to unwind after a stressful day at work.

Mr Wright was widely mocked this week after telling an audience of newspaper editors he does not subscribe to any British newspapers or magazines despite the press being part of his brief as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. He told TalkRadios Julia Hartley-Brewer his comment had been taken out of context and it was complete nonsense to suggest he did not read newspapers. Mr Wright said: Its not even what I said. I was asked a straight question, which is what newspaper did you read that morning  and the answer I gave was I didnt read a newspaper that morning. Which was true.  To suggest that I dont read newspapers is complete nonsense, of course I do. Asked about his Lego collection, Mr Wright said: Its very large indeed, my we would say far too large, but I find Lego therapeutic. I think everybody who does any dficult or stressful job needs a way to switch off. We all have dferent ways, mine is Lego. In my view its a great way of putting your brain into neutral, which sometimes we all need to do. When he took on the job of Secretary of State for digital, culture, media and sport, commentators were quick to point out he hadnt tweeted for three years.

Carly Hemmings, , took a grave risk and hadnt meant to take her own le, a coroner said. The devoted mum had struggled with her mental health over the last few years, as well as alcohol dependency. But it all came to a devastating end in December last year when she was found hanging at home, Chronicle Live reports. A message had been written on the walls saying: Don’t let my nana see me like this. Tell my son I love him. Carly was a devoted mum to her son Mason and a caring nursing assistant who could have achieved so much, her grieving family has said. An inquest heard that on December , Carly rang police and said: Can you do me a favour  I don’t want my nana to find us. But she did not say anything  and would not give her name or address to the call handler.  When police arrived at her home in Ryton on Tyne and Wear an hour later, they found her hanging. A toxicology report showed she had high levels of alcohol in her system at the time. The inquest heard that Carly had suffered from mental health issues for several years which appeared to stem from an episode of postnatal depression, and had been admitted to hospital previously after attempted overdoses. Her GP, Dr Elsa Randles, told the hearing that when sober, Carly wasnt suicidal. But, Dr Randles, said: When she had upsetting news, she started drinking alcohol, which would progress to the use of drugs or self-harming. The inquest heard in the weeks leading up to her death Carly had suffered a catalogue of heartbreaking setbacks, including a custody battle over her son and the news that police would not be prosecuting a man suspected of sexually assaulting her. On December , , Carly was admitted to AE at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead after an episode of self-harm, where she was assessed by two mental health nurses, including Val Tippings. Ms Tippings said Carly was initially hostile, but by the end of the assessment had agreed to be referred to the community mental health team, and was future orientated and supportive of the plan for her mental health care.  But just less than a week later, Carly was discovered at home by police officers after calling them to ask for a favour. The inquest heard Carly made the call at .am and police arrived at her house at .am, gaining entry  minutes later. PC Andrew Strachan described how he and paramedics attempted to revive her with CPR, but to no avail. Her family questioned why, given her history of potential suicide attempts, the call was given a grade two priority, which has a response time of an hour, rather than grade one, which has a response time of  minutes. But Paul Whittaker, an investigator from the Independent Office for Police Conductfound no issue with the grading based on the information the call handlers and officers had at the time. Mr Whittaker told the inquest: They acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of Northumbria Police. Coroner Terence Carney ruled that Carlys death was accidental, saying he did not believe she intended to take her own le. Mr Carney said on previous occasions when she had overdosed or self-harmed she was looking for some support, some protection. He said: She displayed emotionally unstable personality traits and clearly had been beset by a number of personal crises. There were instances where le was getting too much for her. I dont believe at any stage she intended to die or that she wanted to die. Sadly she took a grave risk that day. She had taken on board a substantial amount of alcohol which had impaired her thinking. Carlys family spoke of their frustration that they will never know what was going through her mind that day. Her grandfather Frank Hemmings said: We do get upset, we do feel aswe could have done morewe had known the full extent of her problems, but she was such a proud person and I dont think she liked asking for help. The family also called for more communication between mental health organisations, and welcomed evidence from the Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Trust that they have made some improvements, including having psychiatric support within the mental health liaison team. Mr Hemmings said: These things will help other people with mental health problems - its too late for Carly but hopefully it will help other people. And he said the family would always remember her as a beautul girl with an infectious smile and sense of humour. A family statement said: This year has been a long and emotional one. Today may give us some closure, however she will be in our thoughts for ever. Carly suffered with mental health problems, which eventually took her le. We remember Carly as a daughter, sister, granddaughter, cousin and, most of all, a loving mother to Mason, who was only six when his mam was taken from him.

Yellow weather warnings have been issued around the UK and Ireland wind gales of mph forecast. Winds could be strong enough to generate the fourth named storm of the season – Deirdre – although the Met Office and Met Eireann are yet to issue a title. Met Eireann issued the warning yesterday morning as gales are expected to be strongest in the south-west and in high areas. It said: “Friday will be a wet, very windy and blustery day. Top temperatures of C to C, coolest in the north.”  The weekend of misery could see gales and thunderstorms batter the UK as monsoon weather hits. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for rain and flooding. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: “A band of rain will move across the Irish sea and into western Britain on Thursday night extending across the UK through the night. “We are looking at a much bigger pulse of rain coning in on Friday as a separate low-pressure system arrives from the Atlantic. “This will affect all parts of the UK on Friday and into the weekend, there will be strong winds associated with this and it will remain windy into Saturday. “Exposed and coastal regions will see the strongest winds with gusts of mph while inland gusts could touch mph.”  And the wild weather may last up to three weeks, through the rest of autumn and into the winter months. Downpours brought in by strong low-pressure systems swirling in the Atlantic will bring in torrential rain through into tomorrow morning. Tropical air brought in on a supercharged jet stream will see temperatures rise dramatically leading to more ‘convective’ downpours over the next two days. However, Britons are bracing themselves for the ,-mile wide pressure vortex spanning the Atlantic threatening widespread disruption today.  Met Office forecasters are watching the swirling vortex closely which could lead to the fourth named storm of the season – Deirdre. The giant low pressure vortex could see mm of rain dumped, disrupting the south and west throughout the weekend, with wet and windy conditions continuing into next week. A yellow warning has been put in place for wind and rain until tonight when Storm Deirdre is expected to unleash the worst of its weather. Flooding, cancelled trains, ferries and buses, as well as delayed car journeys have be predicted as a result of the wild weather.  Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond said: “This week, a huge vortex of low pressure in the eastern Atlantic will see the jet stream fling a succession of wet and windy spells towards UK. “The potential for disruptive winds needs to be watched. Western parts are most prone. Several wet spells are expected.” It comes as Britons have been urged to batten down the hatches as five more storms look set to lash the country before Christmas in what could be a record breaking year. So far three storms have hit the country this Autumn, with Ali and Bronagh arriving in September and Callum the month after.  Ex-hurricane Oscar’s mph gusts cancelled fireworks displays in the north of England. As Christmas nears five more storms are forecast to land according to The Weather Company, the worlds biggest commercial forecaster. They will be called Deirdre, Erik, Freya, Gareth and Hannah. If the turbulent weather does materialise it would make  a record breaking one, with eight named storms hitting the UK in the year up until Christmas.  In  - the year storms were first named - five landed, followed by two in  and three in . Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: “Four more named Atlantic storms are expected by early December, plus the risk of a fth named storm before Christmas. “Travel disruption and wind gusts over mph in parts of the North and West are expected. “A stormy, mobile Atlantic pattern is forecast in early winter, before a colder pattern from New Year onwards as westerly winds ease.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad left four month old","story":"NewsDad left four-month-old son to rot to death in maggot-filled nappy for two weeksZachary Paul Koehn blamed baby Sterling Koehns mum for his death, but was this week convicted of murderShareByBradley Jolly:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV News in court, has been found guilty of murder\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Dad-guilty-after-baby-left-to-rot-to-death-in-nappy-that-wasnt-changed-for-two-weeks.jpg\" Zachary Paul Koehn, picturedin court, has been found guilty of murder \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA monster dad left his four-month-old son to rot to death in a maggot-filled nappy which wasnt changed for two weeks.

After managing to lose a staggering st lb , Lexi Reed, , from Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, started struggling with the agonising soreness in her jaw, neck and back this year. Terre, who weighed  stone, had symptoms that left her helplessly crying in front of the mirror and baffled doctors who believed it to be sinus or root canal problems. It was only two months ago that husband Danny, , suggested her loose skin could be to blame. He held up the skin on her stomach and she felt relief from her pain for the first time in months. After consulting Dr. Joseph Michaels, it was recognised that the weight of the flab was pulling her body out of its natural posture.  She went under the kne for nine hours, having skin removed from her stomach, thighs and butt, and some of the excess fat taken out through liposuction was transferred to her buttocks. Now in recovery she will soon be free of pain, and while she was content with her loose skin previously, shes now relishing having a flat stomach for the first time in her le. Lexi said: I suffered months of pain, taking four or five antibiotics and was told it may even be a sinus infection.  But I knew my body and the way I felt wasnt normal, the bizarre symptoms werent adding up. A few times I wonderedI would wake up the next day as no one knew what was wrong with me. It wasnt until standing in front of the mirror that we figured it out, some days I would stand there crying to Danny not knowing what was wrong with me. Danny askedthe skin may be causing the problem because of how heavy it was on my new body.  He stood up behind me and lted my stomach from the front to see what it would look like without the skin and for the first time my neck didnt hurt. When he massaged my neck I instantly felt better, it was then that we came to the realisation that it was my skin that was causing me pain. When I reached out to Dr. Joseph Michaels, he told me that the excess skin can affect and throw-off your posture. My skin was pulling down my posture it may have caused me to become a hunchback but since surgery the pain hasnt been anywhere near as bad.  While Im still in pain from the surgery right now I dont have my stomach holding me back and the pain being gone from my neck will be a new le and make it worth it. Lexi started her weight loss journey three years ago, along with husband Danny who weighed stat the time, to help their chances of falling pregnant. At their heaviest they consumed up to , calories in a day and Lexi, the heavier of the two, had a BMI of . - a shockingly high figure compared the healthy range which is between . - . Between them they lost over  stoneand to celebrate their weight loss they embarked on a bucket list of challenges from theme park rides to travelling, kayaking, hiking and more.  Their journey, which was spurred on by regular chants of Baby Reed, left Lexi lean at st and Danny weighing st  . Despite Lexis surgery to remove her loose skin, she insists vanity played no part in her decision and she was in fact proud of her battle wounds. Lexi said: I weighed lb at my heaviest so I knew going into this I would have loose skin. I was determined it was not going to hold me back from doing things like rollercoasters, climbing stairs and being fatigued. I saw my skin as a battle wound, I knew my body didnt deserve to carry around the weight of all the excess skin.  I would have preferred to have ten times extra skin than be lb and on my death bed, theres so much more I can do now. I could fit in a airplane seat, go for walks and so many things, my skin never held me back before. People shouldnt be afraid of having loose skin, but instead worry about not living their best le. Lexi still has been left with other loose skin on her legs and arms, but doesnt see them as a problem. Despite this, looking at her new stomach was a moving moment having the , of skin removal surgeries to reduce and hopefully eradicate her pain. Lexi said: Seeing my stomach was emotional, I have never had a flat tummy in my entire le.  I always had rolls, stretch marks and never had a perfect body, so while this decision wasnt for vanity reasons its amazing to see the hard work over the past three years. Dr. Joseph Michaels who performed the surgeries over nine hours, says it was a privilege to help Lexi and he hopes this will start a new chapter in her le. He said: Excess skin can constantly pull on her skeleton and can cause pain in the back, neck and other areas. Its not just the sheer strain but the way it pulls the body and the problems that can cause. The skin can be an issue in terms of their hygiene and daily activities, fortunately Lexi is very mobile, but was being caused chronic pain. The surgery will not only help her contour but aids to relieve her body of a lot of excess skin. We removed seven pounds of excess skin, theof it was over ft wide and .ft tall, we would have taken more away but need it for her buttocks.  We dont want patients to look like a pancake on their buttock, we want good shape and good curves. Im very pleased with how the surgery came out and happy that she is reporting improvements with her muscular skeletal pain. The board-certied plastic surgeon who has a speciality in post-weight loss surgeries aided Lexi by removed skin from her stomach, thighs and buttocks. He also performed liposuction, transferring the fat into her butt cheeks. Dr Michaels said: Its really important for patients to know you cant exercise your skin and for a lot of patients the skin is not only a physical burden but a psychological one too. It can really prevent patients from realising the true extent of their weight loss accomplishments but once the skin is removed the physical and emotional improvement is very dramatic. Its a privilege for me to help patients on this last part of their journeys.

And no, were not talking about the time you told them they couldnt go to Disneyland - were talking about the birds and the bees. It can be dficult to work out how to approach the topic, but as they get older its certainly something they need to know about. But how old should they be when you tell them  This is the question one concerned parent is asking, after discovering her nine-year-old son and his friends were all talking about rather x-rated things. In a post on Mumsnet, a user revealed that her son recently attended a birthday sleepover, but when he came back he was acting a little odd.A few days later the boy came to his mum and said he wanted to tell her something - that he knew all about sex. Understandably, she was disappointed. She wrote: I was slightly disappointed that we hadnt got in there first with the talk, but happy he had come to me to talk about it, so we went over everything. At one point he asks mesex makes a baby every time. I said no you can use contraception, he said like condoms   Confused she asked where he had heard that word and finally the truth came out. Apparently what happened was at his friends sleepover his -year-old brother had come into the room and told them about sex and condoms. So we talked about the age of consent and emotional maturity and things. But things only got worse when the pair got onto the topic of porn. The mum explained: Right at the end I mentioned porn, and just said that hed probably hear people mention it, but that it was a very  type of sex, and in some cases it can be very addictive and impact upon relationships.  Son goes all quiet and then says actually his friends big brother told them to Google porn, so they did. They watched itand then they all thought it was a bit wrong so they turned it off. Feel really down this has happened. We have parental controls on all the devices in our house and keep an eye on what the kids are looking at. She added: I expected this to happen when we hit teenage years, or even high school, but he is NINE, he has still got  months of primary school left. At the end of the post the upset parent asks other users how they would feel in this situation and they were all outraged.  One user commented: I would be very upset and would be speaking to the parents of the boy who had the sleepover. Your poor son. Another said: I would have to speak to the parents tbh.

It is thought the -year-old couple had desperately searched for food and civilisation with their toddler following the breakdown.The young boy, a family friend, was found dead nearby a day later. The group had been on a five-hour commute through the Australian Outback but their car broke down on Friday. Their deaths have now been attributed to hypothermia and starvation.  Ryan, the manager of the Ti-Tree Roadhouse in Ti Tree, the community where the car set off from on Friday, said: I feel for the three-year-old the most - he would have had no idea what was going on. At least the rest of them would have known the trouble they were in. Temperatures had soared to C at the start of the week. It is understood there was no mobile phone coverage in the remote wilderness. The governing Central Desert Regional Council, has offered their sympathy to the communities affected while saying the incident was a timely reminder of the harshness of the Australian outback.  Police in Australia are still investigating. Southern Desert Division superintendent Jody Nobbs told CNN: Although police have no information that suggests there were other passengers in the car, we will continue searches until we are satisfied that all areas of interest have been sufficiently canvassed. Duty superintendent Shaun GIll added: One of the avenues of inquiry that were looking at ispeople walked away from a broken down vehicle and may have suffered as result of that. This does serve, unfortunately, as a timely reminder for anyone travelling on NT roads to ensure that when you travel your vehicle is in a fit state and that you have sufficient supplies including water and a first aid kit.

Ryan James, , quit his lucrative career in finance to become a professional gigolo and charges -,a night for intimate services. The Sydney native has spent six years as an escort and says he was inspired by a former girlfriend who previously worked as a call girl. Mr James made the claims on Australias The Morning Show, ahead of the publication of his tell-all memoir, Secrets of the Sex Industry.He says he was initially too embarrassed to tell friends and family about his radical career change. I didnt tell them [my family] at first. When I did get started I told my friends pretty quickly. My family found out a little later, he said.  It was a bit of a mixed reaction. They dont treat me any dferently because of it. Its probably not the kind of thing parents would choose for their children but they still treat me well. His most popular request is the dinner date in which he gets to know clients with an evening meal, followed by a tailored and personal experience back at a hotel or apartment. Mr James charges ,for six hours of pampering and pleasure or ,for an overnight stay with breakfast in the morning.  He says women are often looking for a companionship element to their encounters with him, rather than just sex. Pretty much every single client that I see theres some companionship element to the booking, he explained to Femail. He also admitted women do not generally have specic fantasies for him to play out. Clients say to me that with a lot of sexual encounters they have the guy makes it about him, he comes and then its over.  They want the focus to be on them. Many do like reciprocating, but they want their pleasure to be in focus. He says also says most people would be surprised at the iety of women he sees as clients. He said: Many of the women I see could easily go to a bar and pick a guy up and have sex that way, he explained. But they want a dferent experience. Sometimes its that theyve been recently orced, or theyre still married but havent been intimate in a long time.Ive had clients who are couples who want a threesome and women who are virgins.

The previous owners had the shop for  years before putting it up for sale.“Through my work as a wedding co-ordinator I worked closely with them as they supplied floral arrangements for a lot of my weddings.“When I saw it was up for sale I was shocked as their work had always been bespoke and completely unique.“With my background I am always looking for creative things to do so I decided to buy the business and through that I inherited the staff.“I also wanted to be hands on and not just learn things from others as I went along so I took myself down to London and did an intensive course at the Judith Blacklock Flower School.“It is OK learning from others, but I think you need to have that confidence in yourself and some independence.“Floral arrangements are also much harder than some people think – it really isn’t just putting flowers in a vase.“From foliage to the flowers to the ribbons everything is created by hand, nothing is bought pre-made which is important as I can make sure everything is perfect and not falling apart.”Now Annabel has been the owner for  years and still prides her work on being bespoke.She added: “No matter what a customer’s budget is, we can work with them to create their own unique flowers.“We can work with any budget and it will always be bespoke to their wishes.”Annabel thinks she has found the career she wants to stick with.She said: “I never realised this business would be such hard work.“It is very challenging but it is very rewarding and I couldn’t imagine myself going back to any of my old work or leaving the shop.”Not only do Annabel and her four staff members create beautul arrangements for weddings, birthdays and funerals they have also been tasked with making pieces for the most talked about building in town – the VA.Annabel said: “It is amazing to be asked to be involved with such a prestigious building.“The VA Heritage Portfolio usually work with florists in Edinburgh, so I was chuffed to bits to be asked to create floral arrangements for events that they hold in the evenings.“It was by personal recommendation that I was approached and they have asked to keep working with me so I must be doing something right.“It is just amazing to be part of something so special and seeing it all come together.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5be022291ace1.jpg ","title":"dundee people recognition for inspirational kirsty","story":"A social enterprise founder has been named as one of the industry’s top  most inspiring women.Kirsty Thomson, founder and chief executive of The Circle on Staffa Place, has been included in the NatWest WISE list.The list, produced every year by NatWest Bank in partnership with Pioneers Post, recognises the  most inspiring and influential women in social enterprise.Kirsty was the only woman in Tayside to be named on the list.

draw with Inverness.He said: “We are very happy, we played very well on Saturday.“For me, the clean sheet in the game was very important – it’s very important for the whole team.“We came back strong after our previous result at home which was, I think, a bad result against Inverness.“On Saturday it was very important to take the three points and play well.“We did that and everybody is happy – we have to keep going, keep working hard because we have a very dficult game on Saturday.“We controlled the game against Queen of the South, especially in the first half.“I can’t think of a shot they had on target which was good but we have to keep our concentration which is not easy.“We have to work hard on the pitch to keep the ball because that isn’t easy either.“I think we played a very good game, everybody was running and gave their maximum.”With Ross County four points ahead in second place and Ayr United a further three points in front at the top with a home match against Queen of the South to come this weekend, Bouhenna says the trip to Dingwall this weekend is the biggest game of the campaign so far.“The Ross County game is very important, the most important since the start of the season because we have to win this game to get nearer to them and make up some points.“This is the best form we’ve been in since the start of the season and it’s very important for the confidence of the players.“Everybody wants to keep this going and to keep winning.“That is very important for uswe want to stay at the top of the league and to go up next year to the Premiership.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5be40c3c5a9a3.jpg ","title":"dundee united players out to put things right at ross county","story":"Full-back Callum Booth says Dundee United are heading to Ross County to “put things right” after the Staggies dished out a -

I got a run of games without injuries.“I was playing first-team football against senior pros week-in, week-out.“Every week I was playing against good players with dferent qualities and I think that helped me massively.“Going from playing Under-s to first team can be a massive change.“It is a level up, it’s more physical and you learn much more playing with senior players.“It didn’t really go to plan in the Championship for Brechin, but I took the positives from it and came back a better player.“I feel I am seeing the benefits of that. I would put a lot of my improvement down to that spell.“I’m more confident and that has helped me and hopefully I can push on now.“There are a lot of young boys here trying to push on and make an impression here. We are pushing each other on every day in training and hopefully we can take our chance when it comes.”McLennan has been pleased with his contributions to the first team so far this campaign – the highlight of which was his stunning strike against St Mirren.He added: “I have been pleased with my impact, I’m pleased to be more in and around the first team this season.“I’ve had a lot of injuries over the last few years so I’m happy to be involved.“That goal was something you dream of as a kid to score on your first start for the club and you’re always wanting to make a good impression.“You want to take your chance when it comes and I hope I did that.“It is about trying to stay in the mix. There was a lot of injuries at the start of the season and some of the young players were involved.“And when the gaffer calls upon us we try to do our best.”Tonight Aberdeen, who are seventh in the table, can move up to fourth by beating Hibs at Pittodrie. A win would take them level on points with Rangers in third.After the high of last week where the Dons beat the Gers in the League Cup semi-final and recorded wins against Hamilton and Kilmarnock in the league, McLennan is hoping they can keep the momentum going and make it four in a row.He said: “It will be a tough game and it always is against Hibs.“We’ve played them a couple of times this season and we know what they’re like.“If we could win it gets us up the table and that’s where we need to be.“We had a good week last week with three wins and it’s time for us to kick on.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"aray take honours in sporting start to dunoon mod","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThere is more to the Mòd than music and drams, and this year#s Royal National Mòd in Dunoon was launched with a festival of sport.Scotland’s biggest Gaelic cultural festival traditionally features shinty, and this year it was Inveraray and Col Glen adult teams contesting the Mòd Cup on Saturday October .A close and hard-fought contest  at Dunoon Stadium in wet conditions resulted in victory for Inveraray, who overcame the Glen  #  after a strong second half performance.Up at the Dunoon Grammar School all-weather pitches there was also a nine-aside women’s shinty match between Oban Lorn and Cowal Ladies, with the Oban team coming out on top -.The Mòd played host to the first ever Primary Schools’ Mòd Shinty Tournament, introduced to celebrate Scotland’s Year of Young People, in which Inveraray again came out on top, beating Kyles and Strachur by a goal to nil.In the Mòd Football Cup, Glasgow Islands came through with a  - win over local team Dunoon Amateurs, which even involved the Glasgow goalkeeper getting on the scoresheet.Chief Executive of An Comunn Gàidhealach, John Morrison, said: #We’ve had a great first weekend at the  Royal National Mòd in Dunoon.

Following Seiber’s ‘Four French Folksongs’ the audience was treated to the accomplished Savolini playing two solo pieces – originally Schubert lieder # now arranged for guitar. Although he only had six strings on his guitar, Savolini was still able to capture the rippling of water under the melody.

The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match. The Argyll Derby kicks off at pm and will be played at the Ropework or Joint Campus G, weather permitting."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August. Buses will continue to operate for the services that haven’t been reintroduced, and for services between Ayr and Girvan. The existing timetable for services between Ayr and Glasgow Central remains in place. Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: “We know it has been a challenging time for our customers, so we are pleased to be able to restore some services between Ayr and Stranraer. “We are working flat out with South Ayrshire Council and our task force partners to get all services to and from Ayr back to normal as soon as possible.” Bill Reeve, chair of Ayr Station Task Force, added: “Theof rail passenger services between Stranraer and Ayr is a welcome step towards resolving this issue. “While we remain mindful there is still work to be done to restore the complete service it is good that hard work by both South Ayrshire Council and the ScotRail Alliance has now made this first step possible. “The Task Force partners continue to work together to ensure we can bring back a full timetable as quickly as possible and we thank businesses, commuters and the local community for their continued patience while we do.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Remembrance weekend will be the first time the new lighting system has been put into operation – following successful tests earlier in the week – with the building staying red throughout Armistice Day until the early hours of Monday, November . The lighting up of the Wallace Tower is just one of a number of ways the centenary of Armistice Day is being marked across South Ayrshire.

Community organisations and groups, churches, knitting groups, day care centres and iniduals across South Ayrshire all took up the call to action to contribute poppies for the banner – signicantly exceeding the target of , poppies to mark the centenary year. And many others, such as schools and council staff, took the time to help tie donated poppies on to the banner, so they could be displayed in all their glory. South Ayrshire has also been selected to take part in a national commemoration to mark the  years since the end of the First World War.Ayr beach has been chosen as one of a handful of locations in Scotland for the national Pages of the Sea project, which is a UK-wide initiative – led by film director Danny Boyle – to pay tribute to all those who left our shores during the war.The project is based around the creation of stunning sand portraits of iniduals who lost their lives during the First World War – for Ayr, the portrait will be Second Lieutenant Walter Tull. Pages of the Sea is very much a community event and people are invited to come along between .am and amand pay tribute to all those who left our shores during the war.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire. The specicationsapproved would only apply to newly licenced vehicles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGlasgowAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS69111168.jpg","title":"tributes paid ayr united legend","story":"NewsTributes paid to Ayr United legend Johnny Graham, who dies aged The Somerset Park legend died last week, aged , and tributes have been led by former teammate Jim McSherry.ShareByMike Wilson:,  NOV NewsJohnny Graham at a packed Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWarm tributes are being paid to Johnny Graham, the skipper who led Ayr United into the first ever Premier League.

Former team-mate Jim McSherry said Graham was one of the best players he ever shared a dressing room with. McSherry, now an Ayr publican, said: “Johnny, who had long hair like one of the Beatles, was one of my heroes when I was starting out as a player. “When I joined the club in , Johnny and his we were so welcoming to me. I remember when Ayr beat Rangers - that first season all the headlines went to Johnny Doyle but Graham gave a masterclass in midfield. He was a terric player and a leader.” Terracing fans posted emotional messages on Facebook as they mourned the loss of the Somerset Park legend. Honest Man veteran Lawrence Grace wrote: “RIP to one of the greatest players to wear an Ayr strip.” Ronnie Hainey added: “One of my favourite players and one of the best.” Robert Somerville said: “Sad news. True Ayr legend, penalty king and all round great.” Allan Durward recalled: “I’ve great memories of the ‘s as a boy, Johnny Graham, Ingram, Doyle, McCulloch, etc. RIP.”  Johnny began his career with Strathclyde Juniors before going on to play for Third Lanark, Dundee United, Falkirk and Hibs. He joined Ayr for pound, in  and went on to score  goals in  games. In October of his first season, he scored all four as Ayr came from - down to beat Airdrie - at Broomfield. Amazingly, he repeated the four goal haul in the second last game that same season when Ayr beat Partick Thistle - at Somerset. Ally handed him the captaincy in - and great times continued as Ayr beat Dunfermline - in April  – player of the year Johnny scored twice – to secure a place in the inaugural Premier League. Graham twice played for the Scottish Football League XI. He ed to Falkirk at the start of season - but within two years came back to Ayr as reserve team coach.

Landowner Red Button is already quids in after getting permission to reduce the size of the car park and build a Costa coffee unit.

A report before next Thursday’s South Ayrshire Council planning committee says: “It’s considered the proposal will not have an adverse impact on the residential character or amenity of the locality. “Accordingly, the application is recommended for approval.” Objectors in Academy Street and Academy Court have hit out over traffic concerns, the impact on local homes, of servicing the other units and why the town needs more retail space when some units are empty. Resident Mark Inglis called for the entrance into the entire precinct to be shted to Portland Street. He said: “There are around  children who are being dropped off and picked up or making their own way to school or nursery and the additional traffic will increase the risk of signicant harm to children. “There is also a sheltered housing complex directly opposite the proposed development with some infirm and elderly people within, the additional traffic on Academy Street I believe will also pose a risk to them and their well being, and increased risk of accident and perhaps fatality.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-beauty-deals-you-cant-miss-out","story":"How many Christmas parties, nights out and family events do you have lined up  We bet itrsquos a fair few!

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday. It will run from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via Port Seton and Prestonpans.ldquoOnce it gets to The Loan in Wallyford it will replace the Tesco T bus by going down Macbeth Moir Road and Pinkie Road, then into Tesco before continuing to Fort Kinnaird.We will evaluate passenger use after a few weeks and hope to be able to expand the route in the new year.ldquoWe also currently run two routes into Tesco, the  and , and, from October , the  will make that three routes which will give a pretty good coverage of the Musselburgh area to and from the store.Iain Clark, chairman of Musselburgh Area Partnership, said: ldquoThe area partnership has recently been presented with the findings of our lsquowhat matters to yoursquo questionnaire, which highlights a number of areas that would make a dference to the daily live of the senior members of our community.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Which is that, when it is known that advice will be published, the author may be constrained by the knowledge that his or her words will be read by a wider audience.Those of us with the full expertise afforded by sporadic viewings of Crown Court, Petrocelli or Better Call Saul will be aware that lawyer-client confidentiality is a central feature of all that legal malarkey. And itrsquos a reasonable point that therersquos previous little point in getting advice at allit is not frank and straightforward, even ndash and probably especially ndashsome of it is not what you wanted to hear.There are people who have already made up their minds that the Chequers deal, or whatever it has transmogried into, is certain to be a dud anyway. But others will want to know , for example, the Attorney-General has concluded that the so-called ldquobackstop in any proposed agreement with the EU would bind the UKrsquos freedom of manoeuvre indefinitely,and when it kicks in at the end of the transition period.The Irish border has provided the EU with a plausible mechanism by which to keep Northern Irelandtied to its regulations and trade model.Thatrsquos perfectly reasonable from their point of view, and even most Brexiters would concede that a period of adjustment, during which wersquoll effectively continue in fairly close alignment with the EU, is probably necessarywe want to avoid a short, sharp shock on exit. As long as it is short, of course.But the transition and duration of the backstop need to be short, too, or there is precious little point in Brexit at all. Yet the EU has no incentive ever to let the backstop drop without an exit procedure from its provisionsthat the UK controls, Brussels could simply spin out trade negotiations for years.As it happens, I would be quite relaxed about staying in the single market, perhaps on terms similar to Norway. But the customs union would preclude forging our own deals with third parties ndash andwe canrsquot do that, Brexit will effectively not have happened. The fine detail of the legal advice which, though the Attorney-General is a politician, should be politically neutral, is where there should be warnings of the potential mantraps for the future.I can see why Mrs May, with her quite extraordinary genius for missing the point, failing to grasp the details and above all, confining herself in unnecessarily restrictive positions entirely of her own devising, should be reluctant to let anyone  know whether some such warning has been given to her. She is, after all, insistent that itrsquos her deal or no deal ndash even though there is not, and never has been, any reason at all for her to take such a stance.Unless others beyond the tiny clique who have so far helped her mismanage this whole process get the chance to see the detail, however, I cannot for the le of me see why we should take her word for it that her deal will do what she claims it will. And that does need to be seen.ITrsquoS a strange thing, advice. All the evidence suggests that most people donrsquot want it, or want it only so that they can ignore it. In politics, however, everybody always wants to see any advice that has been offered. Thatrsquos presumably because theyrsquore so ready to offer their own, which is iniably that the other side have got it wrong, and everybody would be better off voting for their party.For their part, people who have sought advice usually seem reluctant to let anyone  see it, which immediately leads to the suspicion that theyrsquove ignored it, or that itrsquos warned them that their new favourite idea is a damn stupid one.

And itrsquos a reasonable point that therersquos little point in getting advice at allit is not frank and straightforward, even ndash and probably especially ndashsome of it is not what you wanted to hear.There are people who have already made up their minds that the Chequers deal, or whatever it has transmogried into, is certain to be a dud anyway. But others will want to know , for example, the Attorney-General has concluded that the so-called ldquobackstop in any proposed agreement with the EU would bind the UKrsquos freedom of manoeuvre indefinitely,and when it kicks in at the end of the transition period.The Irish border has provided the EU with a plausible mechanism by which to keep Northern Irelandtied to its regulations and trade model.Thatrsquos perfectly reasonable from their point of view, and even most Brexiters would concede that a period of adjustment, during which wersquoll effectively continue in fairly close alignment with the EU, is probably necessarywe want to avoid a short, sharp shock on exit. As long as it is short, of course.But the transition and duration of the backstop need to be short, too, or there is precious little point in Brexit at all. Yet the EU has no incentive ever to let the backstop drop without an exit procedure from its provisionsthat the UK controls, Brussels could simply spin out trade negotiations for years.As it happens, I would be quite relaxed about staying in the single market, perhaps on terms similar to Norway. But the customs union would preclude forging our own deals with third parties ndash andwe canrsquot do that, Brexit will effectively not have happened. The fine detail of the legal advice which, though the Attorney-General is a politician, should be politically neutral, is where there should be warnings of the potential mantraps for the future.I can see why Mrs May, with her quite extraordinary genius for missing the point, failing to grasp the details and above all, confining herself in unnecessarily restrictive positions entirely of her own devising, should be reluctant to let anyone  know whether some such warning has been given to her. She is, after all, insistent that itrsquos her deal or no deal ndash even though there is not, and never has been, any reason at all for her to take such a stance.Unless others beyond the tiny clique who have so far helped her mismanage this whole process get the chance to see the detail, however, I cannot for the le of me see why we should take her word for it that her deal will do what she claims it will. And that does need to be seen."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-bounced-into-backing-second-brexit-vote-by-undemocratic-leadership","story":"Alex Neil insisted there is ldquoa lot of unhappiness over the decision to back a so-called Peoplersquos Vote on the final Brexit deal without asking MPs and MSPs.He said: ldquoIn a democratic party you have the discussion first and then reach a decision that did not happen in this case.Mr Neil, SNP MSP for Airdrie and Shotts, also said some within the party had told him they didnrsquot know what they were voting for when they backed a second EU referendum at Holyrood on Wednesday.The former health secretary told The National: ldquoIt should have been put on the agenda well ahead of the SNP conference but unfortunately that didnrsquot happen.ldquoIrsquove had calls from SNP MSPs who voted for the amendment [on Wednesday], not realising what they were voting for and now regret doing so. I think itrsquos a lesson for the future in terms of party democracy.ldquoIf the choice is between loyalty to Brussels or loyalty to independence. Independence must come first.ldquoThe SNP tends to be highly disciplined organisation and it is very clear on this issue there has been a public spat which is highly unusual in the SNP and that is because of the way the decision was reached and the decision itself.He said there were a growing number of SNP politicians who were not happy about backing a Peoplersquos Vote.It came as SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson spoke out about his concerns after he broke the party whip on Wednesday to vote against supporting a second referendum.Senior Nationalist MPs Pete Wishart and Angus MacNeil have already raised concerns.Mr Gibson said: ldquoAlthough I voted to remain, in my view a referendum should be binding for a generation unless there is a material change in circumstances.He said a Peoplersquos Vote risked setting a precedent which could threaten any future independence vote.Earlier this year, former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill accused Ms Sturgeon of presiding over a ldquofundamentally undemocratic SNP.Pamela Nash, chief executive of pro-UK campaign group Scotland in Union, said: \"These comments from senior SNP figures confirm without doubt that independence will always be the one and only priority for the SNP.\"They deserve credit for being honest with voters, whereas Nicola Sturgeon is only interested in using Brexit in a desperate attempt to boost support for independence.\"Whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer. As the majority of people in Scotland recognise, we are better off as part of the UK.\"AnSNP spokesman said:ldquoWe have made it clear that we would push strongly for any second EU referendum to have safeguards to ensure Scotlandrsquos voice is protected in the event of Scotland voting remain again while the UK as a whole voted to leave. This position was agreed by SNP conference.ldquoScotlandrsquos overwhelming vote to remain in  ndash by far the most decisive vote of any of the UK nations ndash has been completely ignored, which underlines how Westminster completely fails to represent or protect Scotlandrsquos vital national interests."},{"url":null,"title":"armistice 100 centenary celebrations at garioch heritage centre","story":"The Garioch Heritage Centre will be holding an event to mark the Centenary of the end of The Great War.Music of the era will be played by well-known local musician Iain Milne from .pm on Saturday, November , with an opportunity to join in some of the familiar songs of the day – including “Pack up your troubles...”.Margaret Hearne will read war-time poetry and reminiscences, and popular dances of the time will be demonstrated.Come along in costume from the timeand join in the fun and camaraderie that was the good part of an awful time, while remembering more serious aspects during the readings.Bring your own bottleyou want a beer or a glass of wine – nibbles will be provided.Tickets cost £ and can be purchased by calling the Centre on   or emailing info@gariochheritage.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police operation launched to tackle poaching viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"first phase of homes released in inverurie","story":"North east housebuilder CHAP Homes has opened its on-site sales cabin to enable keen buyers to reserve a new home at its Lochter development.With construction already underway, the Westhill-headquartered developer has joined local housebuilder Malcolm Allan on the prime -acre Lochter site.The development will ultimately be home to around  properties ranging from bungalows to large family homes and commercial premises.The first residents are expected to be able to move in next spring.Around ten years in the planning, Lochter is close to the newly-opened Uryside School, with the local academy, the town centre, and a large supermarket and retail park just a short distance away.Planning conditions attached to the development included supporting the delivery of the primary school, constructing pedestrian footpaths, and Malcolm Allan Housebuilders also built the link road connecting the B Oldmeldrum road to the B at Rothienorman.Colin Wood, technical manager at Malcolm Allan Housebuilders said: The Lochter development is a key part of our strategic plan for the long-term expansion of Inverurie to the east of the thriving town centre.“We are very pleased to have the first homes nearing completion after many years of planning.”CHAP Homes will build  homes on what it calls its “Crest of Lochter” development, ranging from two, three and four-bedroom detached and semi-detached houses.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAs we approach  years since the armistice, Scottish airline Loganair has introduced a discount fare for members of the armed forces, veterans and the armed forces community.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They also campaign to improve their lives and remember the fallen.Mark Bibbey, chief executive of Poppyscotland said: “Members of the Armed Forces are often based far away from home so an initiative like this which offers a signicant discount on travel must be applauded. This will also make Loganair’s extensive network more accessible to those who have served, and to Forces families too.It underlines Loganair’s commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community and is just the latest way in which they have demonstrated this. We thank them for their continue support.”To find out more about the Armed Forces Fare visit www.defencediscountservicecopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold.

In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens. I think we are in the last chance saloon andwe do leave, I’m not sure how it’s going to be,” she says, sounding resigned. Butanyone should be tempted to say to her, “Cheer up love, it may never happen!” I refer you to one of her handy general purpose put-downs, “Keep talking and it will.”@JanetChristieJo Brand will appear in Nativity!

From  to , Mr Cooke provided weekly updates on America from America. His BBC Radion  show, aptly titled Letter from America, was great to tune into. I actually quite miss his wit and humour and the lens he used to consider what was taking place across the Atlantic. And as I sit here in Austin, Texas this morning, having spent a week in the Lone Star state, it makes me think about what I would tell you in my own notes on what is happening here in the USA. Let’s give it a try...One could be forgiven for thinking that I had arrived in the wrong country as I landed at Austin International airport. The usual ‘Welcome to America’ posters were positioned above the customs hall. But, all along the concourse and flying outside was the Lone Star flag. This official flag of Texas symbolises much more than simply being a state flag.It lets the rest of America know that Texas is dferent – very dferent in fact. Texas and many Texans see themselves as a separate country, detached from the main USA, and they are sometimes a little bit snfy about it. From car bumper stickers to T-shirts to Christmas tree ornaments to flags on the front lawn, Texans make it clear that they have their own identity. A bit like the UK and its relationship with the EU. Who knows, maybe one day Texas will indeed produce its own Nigel Farage.I asked the concierge at my apartment block where a good place to eat would be downtown. I like that America still has the concierge concept at so many places. It gives me that sense of security and local knowledge that an App sometimes does not convey.I was told that Easy Tiger was a great place to eat with freshly baked in-house artisanal bread. “That’s where I go sir” she stated proudly. How could I not go there now  While providing me with directions, she commented “then you will go past a bunch of homeless, but don’t worry they’re harmless...”. And, as it happened, on the -yard walk to the diner, I did pass a bunch of homeless people. About  souls, a mixture of white and black Americans. None begged or harassed me, but it made me think about the land of the free.: Jim Duffy: I’d prefer my own ‘moon flag’ to a Scottish saltireSuffice to say that Easy Tiger on th Street was awesome. The smoked turkey sandwich with Austin draft India Pale Ale was tasty and wholesome. I noted two things when I was there.The first was that the menu showed no big brewery beers – Coors, Bud etc. It was all local micro-brewery stuff. I asked the waitress, an Australian girl who settled in Texas, why this was. She said that there was a backlash against big corporations and that Austinites preferred to buy local, eat local, and support local. They loved their startups and put their money where their mouths were when it came to food and drink. The second thing I noticed was how tipping had progressed in the USA. Tipping is a big part of American culture. I had always through - per cent was a decent tip. Not any more. The screen I was presented with when paying my bill offered me ,  or  per cent or no tip. My enquiries with my lovely Aussie waitress revealed that her hourly rate was a measly .an hour. Her aim was too make .an hour with tips. Well done Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for bringing in the UK minimum wage, I thought. If I gave her  per cent, it meant I was not happy with the service,  per cent she had done just fine and  per cent she had surpassed my expectations. It felt personal. And it was replicated everywhere I went. I had four options and as I looked at the person waiting on me, how could I not tip - per cent knowing what they earned hourly.My Australian friend in Austin told me that there where some great election parties to attend that night in the local bars. From pm, Happy Hours would start and,I had my “I voted” pin with me, I could get  per cent off food and drink.: Jim Duffy: Why I’ll never be a sperm donorI opted for a bar across the street from my apartment. It was called Hen. Sitting at the bar, it was showing two big TV screen. One was showing CNN. The other Fox News.I ordered another IPA, which of course was local – IPA, denoting the area dialling code. I would have more of this IPA as it was hugely flavoursome. The bar tender was very excited about the elections. In a column in The Scotsman I would not be allowed to print the expletives that emanated from his voice box when I asked about Donald Trump. You get the point ... He was excited because this could be the night that Ted Cruz was upended and the progressive liberal Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke had a great chance of getting in. As it happened, a few beers later it was neck and neck. The whole bar was ecstatic.When I awoke in the morning, the euphoria had been short lived. Cruz had retained his seat in the US Senate. I felt a little deflated, but Texas was no longer red . It was now a ‘purple’ state indicating that things were changing.I went to an east-side honky-tonk later that night where I loved the cowboys dancing in their hats to live country music. Only in America ... I’m off to Calornia for a few days at the weekend. And as I turned the TV on this morning, I see another mass shooting has taken place in the USA, this time in Calornia.

Despite improvements, Glasgow’s buses are still way behind Edinburgh’s, albeit with signs of improvement.: ‘Best railway Scotland’s ever had’ delayed by wrong type of threadFor my purposes, driving is not much less problematic. In theory, it should be the easiest and most convenient, although also the unhealthiest and likely least green way of travelling.For me, there’s uncertainty over journey times and parking, but by far the biggest drawback is that it is “dead time”, where it is not safe or legal to do much more than listen to the radio.I find air travel, unavoidable for the longest trips, the next most tedious. Not the flying experience, which can be amazing, such as unexpected view of the snow-capped coastal mountains of Greenland while crossing the Atlantic last month, but the stop-start nature of the process. It’s all about queues: to drop-off bags, get through security, board the plane – and then the reverse after landing.Trains are better, with the railways a discrete travel system, so you know exactly where you are going. It is also relatively easy to work en route, although there are limitations on what you can expect from free wi-fi, especially when carriages are busy.Yes, they can be subject to horrendous disruption, and trains have far fewer ersion options than on the roads. But luckily, with four routes across the Central Belt between Edinburgh and Glasgow, where I do most of my travelling, there is often an alternative when something goes wrong on one.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialTaking a taxi is perhaps the most effortless way to travel,you can afford it, and Uber-style apps even eliminate the uncertainties over waiting times.Walking, where it’s feasible, I find to be an even better option – getting those steps in as part of the working day. With the right online map, it also provides, uniquely, journey-time certainty – so long as you can be sure of the suitability and desirability of the route being offered by often car-orientated algorithms.And the best way to travel  Well, I think cycling is the most fun for the freedom it gives. It’s true, there is the hassle of getting kitted up against the rain, there’s a limit to how much you can carry, and the risk of a slightly dishevelled appearance on arrival.But evenyou don’t have your own bike, the growing spread of cycle-hire schemes within towns and cities make this an increasingly viable option. I just can’t wait for electric bikes to be added to the fleets, which are on their way in Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow and where. They could make it first choice for short trips every time.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826726.1541765471!/image/image.jpg","title":"tories blast nicola sturgeon do more to help family doctors","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has been challenged to #do the right thing# and invest more cash in Scotland#s GP services, with Tories claiming family doctors had lost out on a #whopping # million# compared to counterparts south of the border.Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw made the plea as he attacked the SNP’s  and a half years of “incompetence” in presiding over Scotland’s health services.With the UK Budget having included £ million of spending for the NHS north of the border, he was “clear more of that increased resource should be going to general practice”.The Tory MSP argued: “More funding to GPs will help our NHS, help keep people out of hospital and reduce demand on critical services.“The SNP say they will eventually increase spending on primary care to % of NHS spending but GPs are also being told they will have to wait till  to see it.”Pressing the issue at First Minister’s Questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Carlaw asked the SNP leader to “do the right thing and give Scotland’s GPs and patients the support they need now”.Mr Carlaw, who is standing in for Ruth Davidson while she is on maternity leave, stated: “In each and every one of the last five years investment in general practice has been lower in Scotland than it has been south of the border, a spending gap that has amounted now to a whopping £ million of support lost to primary care in Scotland.”Ms Sturgeon insisted the Scottish Government was “working towards” the target of having  per cent of frontline NHS cash go to primary care by .She said this had to be achieved on a phased basis “so we don’t destabilise acute services as we do that”.She added: “We have got to make sure we get that balance right.”The First Minister also said that “investment in primary care has gone up every single year of this government”.In addition to this, she said health spending in Scotland was seven per cent higher per person than in the rest of the UK, with Scotland also having more GPs per person than south of the border.In England there are  GPs per , people while Scotland has  for every , of the population, she said.She told Mr Carlaw that the additional UK Budget cash for the NHS was “welcome” but insisted it was £ million less than the amount initially promised by the Conservatives at Westminster.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826678.1541704679!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s schools to be world s first to offer lgbti inclusive education","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish primary and secondary pupils are to become the first in the world to be taught in a schools# system that has LGBTI education embedded in the curriculum. : Teaching union votes for LGBT to be taught in Scotland’s schoolsEducation secretary John Swinney yesterday announced that all state schools in Scotland will be supported to teach LGBTIequality and inclusion.The move was warmly welcomed by politicians and gay rights campaigners, but there was concern from religious groups that families who were not committed to “radical LGBT politics” would feel isolated. Last night the Scottish Government confirmed that the initiative would run in conjunction with its Curriculum for Excellence, which takes effect from when children enter school aged four or five until they leave.When asked how LGBTI matters would be dealt with when it came to the youngest pupils, a Scottish Government spokesman said it was “for schools to decide how they deliver education, based on the needs of the children or young people”.Under the initiative, LGBTI equality and inclusion will be taught across age groups and subjects and will be grouped under ious themes.According to Mr Swinney, the themes will include LGBTI terminology and identities tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia prejudice in relation to the LGBTI community and promoting awareness of the history of LGBTI equalities and movements.Speaking at Holyrood, Mr Swinney announced the Scottish Government will accept all  recommendations made by the LGBTI inclusive education working group.It means all state schools will teach pupils of all ages about LGBTI equality, with the government to fund training on this for teachers.Ministers will also ensure all schools have “appropriate” LGBTI teaching resources for lessons.Research by TIE , which has campaigned for the initiative, had previously revealed four out of five teachers do not feel adequately trained to tackle homophobia, biphobia or transphobia.TIE research has also found that  per cent of LGBTIpeople experienced homophobia, biphobia or transphobia at school.TIE co-founder Jordan Daly hailed Mr Swinney’s announcement and declared that the“destructive legacy” of Section  – which banned the promotion of homosexuality – had been ended.“We are delighted that LGBTI inclusive education will now become a reality in all of Scotland’s state schools,” he said. “This is a monumental victory for our campaign and a historic moment for our country.”He added: “The implementation of LGBTI inclusive education across all state schools is a world first and, in a time of global uncertainty, this sends a strong and clear message to LGBTI young people that they are valued here in Scotland.“Eighteen years from the repeal of Section , we can finally put its destructive legacy to bed.”But Simon Calvert, deputy director of the Christian Institute, which has almost , supporters in Scotland, said: “Parents, pupils and teachers expect schools to do all they can to stop bullying of any kind. But they don’t want to see controversial political agendas embedded across the curriculum. Maths lessons should be about maths, not LGBT politics. “There are a ersity of beliefs about LGBT issues in Scotland. The approach adopted by the Scottish Government assumes there is only one acceptable view. “What this means is that children from families who do not share this commitment to radical LGBT politics will be made to feel isolated in their schools. “LGBT activists are often highly intolerant of traditional religious views and the people who hold them.”But Mr Swinney took issue with Mr Calvert’s view. The education secretary said: “I am aware that some may say that LGBTI inclusive education could undermine the values of their faiths or beliefs. I do not take this view.“Human rights and the values of respect and tolerance are universal. Children and young people should feel happy, safe, respected and included in their learning environment, and all staff should be proactive in promoting positive relationships and behaviour in the playground, classroom and society.”The announcement was broadly welcomed across Holyrood, with Labour’s Iain Gray describing the Tie campaign as “powerful, persuasive and long overdue”.Liberal Democrat Alex Cole-Hamilton also congratulated TIE – but had to remove one of their rainbow-coloured ties after being told by Holyrood Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh not to wear such“ostentatious campaign material”. Mr Cole-Hamilton said: “While I meant no disrespect to the Parliament or the Presiding Officer, Lib Dems exist to fight for a world that is free from conformity and I want to do everything I can to further the aims of the Tie campaign.”First Minister Nicola Sturgeon praised the campaigners on Twitter, saying: “Well done to the @tiecampaign and others who worked so hard to achieve this outcome and ensure that LGBTI inclusive education will become a reality.”Scottish Secretary David Mundell also congratulated the TIE campaign.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826778.1541749233!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may promising all things to all people on brexit nicola sturgeon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said the UK Government is risking a disastrous Brexit by promising all things to all people.Scotland’s First Minister claimed Theresa May is not constructing a lasting deal and is trying to dupe people and hide the damage leaving the EU will cause.Speaking ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Council on the Isle of Man, which will be also be attended by her counterpart in Wales as well as Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington MP and representatives of the governments of Guernsey, Jersey and the host island, Ms Sturgeon said it is time for the UK Government to be “straight with people”.She said: “The Prime Minister isn’t putting together a deal that will last.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Ms Blessington revealed: \"It was handmade by Hamish Stone, of Nethy Bridge, and he painstakingly followed the  pages of directions from online to create the pizza oven from the redundant interior walls of the railway station.\"Another attraction is the purpose built Highland games field. Mr Garman has competed for many years on the circuit in his native United States and now nearer to his Revack home although injury prevented him this past season.There will be games demonstrations with the Grantown East staff getting involved too.The venue is horseshoe shaped to allow maximum viewing pleasure. Mr Garman said: \"I have been to hundreds of Highland games fields and the only thing I have always found is the spectators can not get high enough to see what is going on and also get good pictures.\"We will be staging demonstrations as many times as we possible can. We are cross-training all of the staff interested in the Highland games to be demonstrators so they can share the sports in a safe and informative manner too.\"The couple admit it has taken a while to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Belfast-born poet Michael Longley will read his acclaimed work Ceasefire.Attendance is by invitation only, and the service will be broadcast live on BBC One Northern Ireland and Radio Ulster.It will follow the traditional Evensong format, led by the choir of St Annes and members of the Ulster Orchestra. The service will provide a moment of reflection rather than an Act of Remembrance, and instead of laying wreaths, volumes of Irelands Memorial Records will be laid at a field altar. The service is due to end at around .pm, when a lantern will be carried out from the cathedral in commemoration of the fallen.It will be the last major commemoration of the First World War. It will take place at the same time as services in Dublin, Glasgow and Cardf.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, chairman of the Northern Ireland World War One Centenary Committee, which planned the service with St Annes, said yesterday: \"Ulstermen and Irishmen have been remembered in all the places they fell.\"There have been special moments that not long ago would have been unthinkable, such as royal princes and dukes paying respect to Irelands dead, and Irish Defence Forces pipers playing at Belfast City Cenotaph.\"Far from being purely symbolic, a deeper understanding, tolerance and respect has flowed from these events. Relationships have been built that have already proven their worth, and will last. \"No ones unionism or nationalism is diminished as a result.\"Dean Forde said: \"When the Armistice was signed it is said that not a single family in these islands was untouched by personal grief, expressed in the silence of mourning, and the silence of the soldiers who would not speak of the horrors they had endured. In this unique and special service, we will both remember the loss, but also lay hold of the hope which those who suffered and died in the Great War held.Our greatest tribute  years later will be to succeed in that ambition for peace. \"There could be no greater way by which we can declare: We will remember them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader foster says unionists should be alarmed after letter from pm suggests she is wedded to idea of border down irish sea","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Foster told The Times that the letter \"raised alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the UK\".\"From her letter, it appears the Prime Minister is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea with Northern Ireland in the EU single regulatory regime,\" the Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA said.The Prime Minister currently relies on ten DUP MPs to help her pass key legislation at Westminster through a confidence and supply agreement.In her letter Mrs May wrote that the backstop was \"an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use\" and that it would not last indefinetly.The Prime Minister wrote that she would \"not accept there being any circumstances or conditions in which that backstop to the backstop, which would break up the UK customs territory, could come in to force.\"\"That is why it is critical that the provision for a UK-EU joint customs territory is legally binding in the Withdrawal Agreement itself, so that no ‘backstop to a backstop’ is required,\" Mrs May wrote.A Downing Street spokesman told The Times that the Prime Minister would not agree to anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.\"The Prime Ministers letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories,\" the spokesperson said.\"The Government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"flight out of belfast nosedived 500ft due to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had sought to enter as a visitor.Mr Mallet’s visa rejection in October came shortly after he hosted a talk at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents Club by the head of a now-banned political party advocating the financial hub’s independence from China.The FCC is now reiterating its demand for an immediate explanation for this aggravated and disproportionate sanction against @VJMallet that seems completely unfounded. https:t.co BzIgehCVA— FCC, Hong KongNovember , That brought heated criticism from the territory’s pro-China elite, some of whom called for the journalists’ organisation to be kicked out of its clubhouse in the central financial district.Hong Kong’s immigration authority has given no explanation for his expulsion and on Friday responded with a statement saying it would “act in accordance with the laws and policies and decide whether the entry will be allowed or refused after careful consideration of the circumstances of each case”.In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Hong Kong had the right to decide who could enter the territory.“As you know, when people travel around the world, it is normal for every country to permit or reject a visitor’s entry according to its law governing the administration of entry and exit,” she said.Despite Mr Mallet’s rejection, Hong Kong on Friday permitted dissident writer Ma Jian to enter to attend a literary festival, even after an arts venue in the city cancelled his appearance.I was let through. No problem. Just heard that the second venue has pulled out of hosting my talks.— 马建 Ma JianNovember , Ma, whose novels frequently satirise China’s communist leaders, told reporters he experienced nothing unusual while passing through passport control and that organisers were still lining up a place for him to speak.“The lecture will definitely happen. If there is a single Hong Kong person who is willing to listen, or a single reader who contacts me, I will be there,” Ma said.Ma speculated there was a “black hand” behind authorities controlling the conditions under which he could appear, but vowed to “communicate with readers over these days in Hong Kong however possible”.In a statement, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said that in barring Mr Mallet, the government was “severely violating the freedoms of press and speech, and further damaging the reputation and status of Hong Kong as an international city”, according to the South China Morning Post.Pro-democracy legislators on the city council also expressed worries over the incident, saying the erosion of basic legal rights could harm Hong Kong’s ability to attract foreign investment.The denial of a visa to Mr Mallet was widely condemned by journalists, human rights and civic society groups in Hong Kong, who saw it as a sign of China’s growing encroachment on freedom of speech in the city.Concerns have also been raised by the apparent kidnappings and prosecutions in China of independent booksellers from Hong Kong and legal cases brought against pro-democracy legislators and organisers of large-scale anti-government protests in .Hong Kong was promised semi-autonomy for  years as part of its  handover from British rule, allowing it to retain its limited democracy and rights to assembly and free speech that are denied on the Chinese mainland."},{"url":null,"title":"200 acre site outskirts derry identified preferred location new cemetery","story":"A site has been identied on the outskirts of Derry for a new municipal cemetery to service the city.The move comes after the Derry News revealed earlier this year that ‘shortlist’ of sites has been

areaon the outskirts of the city to determine whether it would be suitable.It is understood that the  acre site, which is situated close to a church, is now being considered as the preferred location

preferred location for the facility.“Council is currently progressing with plans to develop a new municipal cemetery within the wider cityside area of Derry city and recently received a number of submissions following a recent call for expressions of interest from those with lands available that could suit this purpose,” the spokesperson said.“A shortlist of sites has now been identied and further research is now taking place to scope the suitability of each site.”Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, the independent councillor Sean Carr, who also works as funeral director, welcomed the progress.“The Killea site is only three miles outside the city, and it has the capacity needed,” he said.“Even though it might be outside of the city itself, people should keep in mind that it’s only a ten minute drive away, and would provide enough burial space for decades.”He also called on the council to ensure that the development of a new crematorium remained a

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Picture: Charles McQuillan Pacemaker.“What’s important is we get a deal that satisfies our requirements - and by our requirements I mean the whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.“We don’t have that proposed deal yet. When we do we’ll be able to discuss it.“There is no doubt we have understood the concern the DUP and others have expressed about a hard border down the Irish Sea, we share it, and we will not accept a deal that involves that component.”Mr Wright’s remarks came after his interview was paused as DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson was on the phone.Mr Wilson said the DUP has “a number of concerns” and accused Downing Street of leaking the letter sent to DUP leader Arlene Foster, telling the same programme: “I assume it’s part of the process of trying to get into the public domain what will finally be agreed.”Mr Wilson also said: “In that letter it makes it quite clear the government has accepted there will be a Northern Ireland-only backstop, that backstop will require specic alignment for regulations, a solution which does that, and the scope of that will be carefully subscribed.“Thirdly, the promise which was made in the agreement in December thatthere was to be any regulatory alignment then Northern Ireland would have a say on that - that seems to have been removed as well, which would mean regulations which would apply to Northern Ireland would not be decided at Westminster, would have no input from Northern Ireland and would come only from the EU.“That, to us, is a breach of the promise which has been made that we would not be cut off from the rest of the United Kingdom.”Askedhe accepted Theresa May’s pledge of no border in the Irish Sea, Mr Wilson replied: “We want to trust the Prime Minister because she has said so many times that that is the case, but you have to judge any promise by what is actually delivered in an agreement.“From what we can see in the letter which has been sent to Arlene and Nigel , it is quite clear some of the promises made do not conform to some of the content of the letter.”Referring to calls for the government to publish the legal advice it has been given on the Irish border issue, Mr Wright said it is “certainly possible” to release legal advice given to the government.Weather warning: Heavy rain and strong winds expected to batter Northern Ireland later today Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But he told the BBC: “We don’t do it because it’s important the legal advice government gets is frank, is honest and,it’s something the giver of that advice thinks might appear on the front page of a newspaper, there is no guarantee it will be phrased in a way that is most helpful to the government decision-making process.”Mr Wright added: “summaries are sometimes set out” to help MPs understand issues, noting: “It will be up to the government as a whole to decide whether that’s the appropriate course here.”Mr Wilson said he understood the points raised, but added that Irish border Brexit advice should be published.He told the BBC: “I think it is important that, for the sake of clarity and so everyone knows what they’re signing up to, that the convention is breached in this case and the legal advice be made available.”try catch     .               ..

Itrsquos about the people you love and the things you care about. Your will helps pass on your principles and the values that matter to you. A gt in your will can ensure that your most loved charities can continue to make a dference for many years to come.Will to Give member USPCA We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our valuesEimear McCooey, Will to Give Chair, agreed: ldquoWe plan for lersquos major milestones births, weddings, anniversaries but most of us shy away from talking about and planning for death - yet it is the one thing that is guaranteed to happen to us all!I strongly believe that talking openly about the future can help ensure we have a better experience when it eventually does happen, and one of the things we can plan for is the legacy we want to leave behind.Making a will is important because it gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your wishes will be respected and the ones you love are looked after, whether that be family, friends or even a well-loved charity. I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will. It really doesnrsquot matter what size ndash small or large, every gt is greatly received.It is very easy to leave a gt in yourwill to charity ndash in fact, hundreds of people do it every year in Northern Ireland. We will always advise you to speak with your solicitor to have your will drafted correctly. Your solicitor should be familiar with how to write such a gt into your will.Further informationWill to Give is a charity dedicated to promoting charitable gts in Wills in Northern Ireland.

We have recognised more than  Irish recipients of the Victoria Cross and the names of many more men and women have been added to memorials old and new commemorating the war.”In a letter published in the order of service, the Republic’s foreign minister Simon Coveney “For far too long remembrance of the war on the island was a source of ision. There was a sense that commemoration of the young Irishmen who died in the Somme or Gallipoli was a political declaration, or a marker of community identity.”“In recent times, and as we have marked the centenaries of the events of that decade, we have seen something very dferent. We have seen leadership and scholarship and sensitivity and generosity.” Television and radio coverage begins at .pm.NI mandies after road traffic collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

As citizens, we have built the UK together. We have traded together. We have fought together and we have built our lives together. Four years ago, I fought head, heart, body and soul to save our precious Union and helped to stop the SNP from breaking it apart. It is the UK that is a member of the EU, it is the whole of the UK that will leave and it is the UK that must now form a new relationship with the EU. Likewise, it will be the UK that is then free to set its own independent trade policy, its own trade tarfs, sign trade deals with countries such as the US, China and India – and also join Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and others in the Trans Pacic Partnership. And when it comes to negotiating the new relationship between the UK and the EU, it must be done for the whole of the UK. As a Scottish unionist I believe there can be no border down the Irish Sea splitting off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Not only would the application of dferent trading laws and taxes mean that over time Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people – it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland. It is no wonder that the SNP are so keen on it.I welcomed the recent intervention of the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, and the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, in writing a letter to the prime minister making it clear that their blood red line is the integrity of the UK. Unionists across the House of Commons, whether from Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have been completely and consistently clear that there is either a UK-wide deal or no deal at all.  Not a ‘great victory’ but hope of second term for Trump Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The EU has sought to use Northern Ireland to take control of Brexit, and to prevent us from leaving. They have had the audacity to put forward a crude plan that both violates the Good Friday Agreement and would hive off Northern Ireland from the UK. Despite all the scaremongering about a hard Checkpoint Charlie-style border, there is a very clear and logical solution. But the fact that the EU does not seem willing to discuss it raises questions about its motives.The European Research Group of backbench Conservative MPs has published a detailed paper, written jointly by two former Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and an architect of the Good Friday Agreement Lord Trimble, that explains the iety of technical solutions available to ensure that border checks are not necessary. Both the UK and Irish governments have said they will not erect a physical border. In answer to a question in the Dail in Dublin, the EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asserted the EU will not force a physical border on the Republic of Ireland. Revenue and customs officials from the UK and the Republic of Ireland have said they neither need, nor have plans for, new physical infrastructure at borders. With such overwhelming agreement, why is there a problem If the EU can accept that technical solutions for the movement of goods are possible for an imaginary border down the Irish Sea, then those applications can surely be possible between the two jurisdictions in Ireland too. Borders are borders. Whether or not the border is a line in the ground or in the sea there will be a place where the jurisdiction changes. That’s all it is, a change in the laws and who has the authority to enforce them.This used to take place with goods in transit being stopped and clarication sought that the consignments comply with the dferent laws. The perception is that this always takes place when the border is crossed, but that’s not how it happens anymore – technology has changed all that.When Guinness leaves Dublin to go to Belfast, Glasgow or Liverpool the necessary paperwork is completed electronically, taking account of the dfering duties, taxes and regulations so that it complies and any dues are paid to the correct authority. The beer truck is not stopped at the border. Only random checks are necessary and these are conducted anywhere on the journey by officials from any of the jurisdictions involved. There is no fuss made about this either.The idea that there will be a need for border checkpoints holding up traffic, asking for bills of lading [details of a cargo consignment] is a mendacious invention by the EU to keep the UK in its single market and customs union – or ide our country. It is not a choice we have to make.All it needs is for the UK to make that its goal and for the EU to see sense and recognise the border question can be solved.l Ross Thomson is Conservative MP for Aberdeen SouthJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8697388.1541666860!/image/image.jpg","title":"transport","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Transport   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Transport Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Transport       dies after road traffic collision\"  NI mandies after road traffic collisionA man in his eighties, who was involved in a road traffic collision last month, has died in hospital.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Thatrsquos where the team helped as well, they knew how to motivate me.The women said they hope to inspire others by speaking to groups across the UK about both the highs and lows of their expedition.ldquoThe best reaction we get is when someone comes up to us afterwards and admits they have struggled with something and they are now going to try it, Sandy said.ldquoThatrsquos really what we want people to do, to believe in themselves and give stuff a go.Sophie added: ldquoItrsquos not just for professional adventurers, itrsquos for people who have an ordinary le and choose to do something really extraordinary..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ice Maidens prove their extraordinary endurance on Antarctic trek article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
