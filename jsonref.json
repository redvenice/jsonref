As a result, customers must travel miles to make deposits or speak to staff, with those who can’t drive hit hardest.Father-of-three, 47, slams justice system for \u0027pathetic\u0027 £70...Councils struggle to cope with Christmas clean-up as UK\u0027s...Share this articleSmall firms suffer, too, because they have to shut while owners go to a bank in another town.Losing the last branch can be fatal for a high street because it gives shoppers a reason not to visit, triggering a drop in footfall.Labour MP Wes Streeting, who sits on the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘Branches are closing at an alarming rate, causing real problems – particularly for older people, small businesses and disabled people.‘Banks provide a crucial public service and bosses must start showing they understand this.’Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The frightening pace of branch closures is damaging local communities, hurting vulnerable consumers and stifling business growth.’Lenders often hassle customers to sign up for online banking when a branch shuts. But pushing less web-savvy customers into using the internet for sensitive financial transactions can put them at risk of fraud. Caroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: ‘Closing branches cuts costs, but it’s at best an inconvenience and at worst a serious blow for millions of older people who are not online or au fait with mobile banking.’Years of cuts have devastated the network of branches. Britain’s largest banks operated 11,240 branches in the late Nineties – but the top five have just 5,073 between them today. NatWest owner Royal Bank of Scotland shut the most this year, closing 431 – a third of its network. It had nearly 2,300 in 2008, when taxpayers rescued it from collapse with a £46billion bailout.

I prefer not to talk. I don’t speak all day apart for a few words to the sister who does the post.’And that’s how Sister Wendy, who has died aged 88, lived for several decades. Until her passion for art and a chance friendship with Delia Smith — who as well as a cook and fervent Norwich FC fan, is a connoisseur of fine religious writing — led to the publication of some of her works, a move into TV and the launch of a very different Sister Wendy.Thatcher’s legal chief wanted to send the police into...Neil Kinnock demanded a top-spec Rover as his official car...Share this articleHer world-famous alter ego was a cult figure with a high voice, huge glasses and very large teeth who presented series such as Sister Wendy’s Odyssey (1992), Sister Wendy’s Grand Tour (1994) and Sister Wendy’s Story of Painting (1996) which often drew a 25 per cent share of the British viewing audience and saw her hailed by critics as the best talking head on art since Kenneth Clark.Because as well as being exceptionally clever and perceptive, she was a natural broadcaster — needing neither script nor autocue, she became known as ‘One-Take-Wendy’ — and made art fun, inspirational and, for a nun who has sworn a vow of chastity, surprisingly accessible.Take her comments on Botticelli’s Venus: ‘You can’t imagine her doing the washing up.’Or her assessment of Stanley Spencer’s Self-portrait With Patricia Preece. ‘I love all those glistening strands of his hair, and her pubic hair is so soft and fluffy’.          Wendy Beckett was born in Johannesburg on February 25, 1930, the daughter of Aubrey Beckett, a banker-turned-doctor and his wife DorothyNot, perhaps, something you’d expect most Carmelite nuns to say, but Sister Wendy just beamed beatifically with her gentle toothy grin — she once said her teeth were so big, she couldn’t actually close her mouth — and we all loved her.Even more so, when veteran feminist Germaine Greer rubbished the idea of a nun discussing sexuality in art and Beckett replied, quick as a flash, that it wasn’t necessary to experience things to understand them.‘Look at Jane Austen,’ she replied. ‘She was a virgin!’Wendy Beckett was born in Johannesburg on February 25, 1930, the daughter of Aubrey Beckett, a banker-turned-doctor and his wife Dorothy.The 12th-century saint and martyr, Thomas a Becket, was an ancestor and Samuel Beckett the playwright and author a distant cousin. She spent her early childhood in South Africa, before the family moved to Edinburgh to further Aubrey’s medical training.Wendy was a solitary, sickly child with a weak heart, a plain face — ‘I was an extremely unattractive child’ she said — and a name created for the character in Peter Pan that she hated because it sounded too ‘trivial’. She was anything but.Wendy was reading the Scotsman newspaper cover to cover from the age of four she loved school and, later, sang the lead role in all the end of term operettas.          Sister Wendy, pictured, was a distant relative of Irish playwright Samuel BeckettHer connection with God started when she was barely three and eating her Sunday sausages to the strains of a military band in the Meadows area of Edinburgh.‘I realised then that God was there and life was going to be wonderful,’ she said.Her parents were not overtly religious, but the nuns at school inspired her. ‘It was clear to me that this was what people did who wanted to belong completely to God,’ she said.Her faith never wavered and, aged 16, and with her parents blessing (‘It’s just as well you look good in black,’ said her mum ), joined the Sisters of Notre Dame in East Sussex. She took the name Sister Michael and didn’t see her family again for three years.‘After six months, I was given the habit — oh glorious day!’ she said.After four years, she was sent to read English at St Anne’s College, Oxford, where — perhaps aided by the fact she studied in a nuns’ hostel with a vow of silence that forbade her to talk to her fellow students — she came top of her year, won a congratulatory first and was wooed unsuccessfully by J.R.R. Tolkien, the author and Oxford don, who wanted her to pursue a career in academia.But nothing could ert her from her chosen course.So she returned to her Sisters where she hoped to lead a solitary life of contemplation, but was asked to teach, first in Liverpool and later in South Africa.This was her first big test. Because while she adored being a nun and had no problem with the vow of chastity (she never wanted to marry or have children), teaching did not suit her. She found it stressful and oppressive: ‘I was doing something I didn’t like, but I was happy because I was doing what God wanted,’ she said.It was only in 1970, when she started suffering stress-induced epileptic fits that she was allowed to return to England as a Reverend Mother to live a contemplative life of prayer in the teeny second-hand caravan she bought for £50 and parked in the grounds of the Carmelite monastery.There, on top of her meditation and hours of prayers, she started translating Medieval Latin to make a contribution towards the monastery’s overheads.She completed five full volumes before suffering a heart attack. When she recovered she was given permission to write spiritual meditations on contemporary art — her great passion.Some were circulated among a small circle of acquaintances and came to the attention of Delia Smith, a Catholic who became a great friend. Delia took her to art galleries and was so impressed by Wendy’s writing that, in the late Eighties, persuaded the Catholic Herald to publish them.It was during a gallery visit that Wendy was overheard discussing art by a film crew who asked to record her and showed their video to a BBC producer. That was the beginning and Sister Wendy’s Odyssey was an instant hit.She was refreshing and unafraid to speak her mind, whether about Leonardo’s ‘preference for boys’, or denouncing modern British artist Damien Hirst as ‘really pathetic’ and his Turner Prize-winning dead sheep and sharks, as ‘not worth a second look’.However tight the filming schedule, she always had the entitlement to attend Morning Mass built into her BBC contract, but juggling her two lives must have been tricky.Not least, because she embraced a surprising amount of non-sacred behaviour in her showbusiness life that could not have been more removed from a pious hermit.Such as smoked salmon sandwiches at the Ritz, hearty meals at the Savoy Grill and wine in lieu of water whenever she was flagging.She also adored horse racing (studying the form in the Racing Post but never placing a bet) and became a passionate Star Trek fan after coming across it on a hotel bedroom television, loving its ‘serious moral message’.She certainly seemed to love the attention — both on and off the screen — and everywhere she went was accosted by fans who insisted she’d changed their lives.But she yearned for her caravan solitude. ‘I never wanted to do it in the first place. If I’d known how much time it would take, I would never have started it,’ she once said of her media career.She always insisted her fellow nuns felt sorry for her, having to trail around the world with a camera crew. Certainly her Sisters might have blanched at some of her comments.Particularly when it came to gay marriage — she would often question the Catholic Church’s code on sexual ethics as a distraction from the important issues of inclusivity and Godliness.But nothing fazed her. Not fame, not unkind comments about her teeth, nor modern society’s obsessions with sex.Sexual organs, she insisted, were ‘just part of the apparatus God made for us’ and nothing to get embarrassed about.She carried on broadcasting until 2001 — her last series was made for U.S. viewers — but then retreated full time to the calm of her caravan, before it fell to bits and she moved into the monastery.She was not remotely afraid of death. ‘I don’t want to slip across,’ she said. ‘I want to be conscious. I want to say: “This is death and I give it to you, God.” ’"},{"url":null,"title":"Study reveals increase wellbeing people donate time","story":"    Volunteer Jenni Peach is pictured at Southampton Hospital with patient Lizzy earlier this month. So far 27,413 people have pledged a combined total of 1,551,528 hours to the NHS over six monthsBut when they broke the results down into different age groups they discovered the association between volunteering and well-being only became apparent in those over 40.Lead author Dr Faiza Tabassum, of Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute, said the findings showed it could help older adults to live longer and healthier lives.She told the Mail: \u0027There are numerous beneficial effects of volunteering on mental well-being such as having a larger social network, more power and prestige and this in turn leads to better physical and mental health.\u0027Volunteering may also provide a sense of purpose, particularly for those people who have lost their earnings, because it regularly helps contribute to the maintenance of social networks and this is especially in the case of older people who often live in isolation. Particularly, with the ageing of the population, it is imperative to develop effective health promotion for this last third of life, so that those living longer are healthier.

It\u0027s taken me quite a while to get back to who I am.\u0027  Meanwhile, Mrs Edwards broke up with her ex in February - however they are still living together, but are in the process of selling the house they own.

How amazing would it be if we got married on our first date?

We decided to video chat so we knew we were real people.\u0027I think the whole idea came about because I asked her what she was doing for Christmas.\u0027She told me she thought she was going to a friend\u0027s house but she wasn\u0027t too sure.\u0027I said I\u0027d probably be doing the same as my family are all away in Egypt over Christmas.\u0027I said to her: How about we have our first date on Christmas Day? I\u0027ll come and meet you. She said: That sounds really nice.\u0027Then I had another light bulb moment and suggested: \u0027How about we go away on holiday for our first date?\u0027 Life\u0027s too short.\u0027The subject of marriage came up and Sarah said: I have always thought about going on that program where couples get married at first sight.            Mrs Edwards sits down for a drink after meeting her soon to be husband at Gatwick Airport            The couple, seen here chatting before they boarded the plane, say they couldn\u0027t be better suited to one another\u0027I laughed and said: Let\u0027s get married then. She said: Don\u0027t tempt me. But later that day she called me and said: I\u0027ve bought the wedding dress.\u0027I said: Are you serious? and she told me: If I say something I mean it.\u0027She asked me if I still wanted to get married and I thought: Yeah, why not? I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone being better suited to me.\u0027 It\u0027s absolutely mental.\u0027We just carried on talking and planning and deciding where we could go and get married at such short notice.\u0027We looked at the Caribbean, New York and Las Vegas and Vegas just seemed to stick, it\u0027s the place to run away and elope.\u0027I was supposed to get married in March this year, but everything happens for a reason - I\u0027m a true believer in that.Mrs Edwards has been married before, but it only lasted for six months.

It\u0027s gone a bit bonkers.\u0027The couple sought out the thousands of bricks used in the wall at car boot sales, auction houses and through online sellers - but became frustrated at how quickly they got through them.They say they have no idea how much they spent in total - but gave an estimate of a couple of thousand pounds.And in true Lego spirit, the couple think their creation is \u0027awesome\u0027 and routinely sing the Lego theme song \u0027Everything is Awesome\u0027.Ms Turford said: \u0027I love it all.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs has expanded its policy to include the devices at private rehabilitation clinics for veterans with spinal cord injuries.The trend is expected to continue in 2019, and other countries are in talks on whether to include the devices in their policies, according to ReWalk.Exoskeletons – powered mechanical frames that wrap around parts or all of the body – have promised superhuman abilities including faster movement and strength, and are tipped as a future mainstay in the military and construction field.Companies developing the products say the technology is more likely to move into mainstream markets through medical use, such as rehabilitation for stroke victims or as a fully automated walking aid for people who have been paralysed.While the kit is expensive for most, the manufacturers hope insurers will increasingly accept the cost as they might with metal hip implants or pacemakers.So far, commercial insurers have done so on a case-by-case basis, and they keep the data private. But ReWalk said its cover came from 38 different providers and said one of the top five insurers in the US was in the final stages of review. It did not name the firm.Larry Jasinski, ReWalk’s CEO, said public and private insurers were increasingly covering the product, either for the entire device or to supply it as a physiotherapy aid.“The German one is the ideal example – they really led the way,” he said by phone. The Dutch and French governments are undergoing policy considerations, as well as New Zealand and Australia, ReWalk says.A significant development came in 2014 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved the ReWalk, affording clout to insurance claims.Others have refused to cover the cost but at least one claimant, a surgeon with a spinal injury, had a success when an external independent review overturned his health plan’s initial denial and deemed the suit medically necessary.Indego, another exoskeleton made in the US, said in an email that it was also covered by some policies in the US and Europe. RSA Insurance Group in the UK has been looking at how providing exoskeletons might, in fact, reduce total costs as the rehabilitation success means patients might be out of care soon, helping claimants to get self-dependent much faster.Jasinski said ReWalk was now working on a lighter, cheaper design that would not fully support a human body but still provide assistance. Unlike the sturdy, metallic exoskeleton, the “soft-suit” will be made of fabric, small motors and cables and is designed for people who retain a degree of mobility but need extra help.“For someone who has had a stroke, or somebody who has had multiple sclerosis, or someone who has Parkinson’s, they can actually still stand,” he said. “They don’t need a device to hold them up, they just need assistance to walk. It’s roughly one-seventh of weight and size of the current product and one-seventh of the cost.”The suit, currently named Restore, could be on the market in mid-2019 the company said it would be covered in clinics once available.“Frankly, from a financial point of view, it’s more than likely our other products are going to have more to do with our financial success, even if they are not quite as dramatic a product,” Jasinski added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768b735f5f9b15118245ac1e563b98976a04f800/0_177_4064_2438/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc8ede172d6aa03cacaf4df9faf73371","title":"high streets church experience economy","story":"I have just had my first Alexa experience. It was in Los Angeles and it was eerie and rather charming. There is no doubt “she” vastly simplifies a range of trivial tasks. To the lonely, she is apparently comforting, like a pet, and with “empathy” increasingly built in, is growing ever more so. But she is clearly driving a nail ever further into the coffin of the classic concept of shopping. Who needs to drive through hellish traffic to a bleak mall when not just your laptop but “Alexa, get me …” will do the trick?All this has come to pass. Spending on bars and restaurants, live entertainment, exercise and, above all, travel continues to soar. So, too, has the money going into simply meeting people, the so-called Tinder economy. The “power of live” is at the core of the post‑digital world. But what has not happened is any change in the physical framework, literally the streets and buildings, where such experiences used to occur. The high street, the traditional forum of the community, is losing its role.I cannot rid my mind of its predecessor in this role, the parish church. These magnificent buildings litter every town and village, most of the time lying gaunt and unused. They are now being joined by the shuttered grocer and the defunct hardware store as symbols of a lost social cohesion. If Thomas Gray were to write his churchyard elegy today – “and leaves the world to darkness and to me” – he would surely move down the road to the high street.Belonging, the current BBC Radio 4 series by Douglas Alexander, is showing how this declining sense of locality is changing more than the economics of a place. It is becoming political. By sucking the oxygen out of community, it sends people retreating to their residual identities. There they are spared any obligation to get on with their neighbours, to socialise and compromise. Hence the Brexit obsession with “taking back control”.It is plain that the social evils now being so intensely debated result from this disintegration of community, and the evils of isolation, homelessness, mental illness and gang culture. The concept of local discipline is dying, as is that of a local leader. How many people truly feel their own experience is reflected by the cosiness of the Archers? Alexa is the new Ambridge.Until a century ago, the church was the fulcrum of such a community. It was the fount of education, welfare and local participation, the rock on which the ideal of localism rested. That rock was replaced by all that was meant by the high street, a congeries of town halls, shops, clinics, banks, police stations, libraries. It is vanishing.There is no loss of vitality in the desire to congregate. The traffic on the M1 or a Los Angeles freeway is craving somewhere to go and something to do – the so-called “doing-not-buying economy”. But the congregation it seeks is one of brief affinities, not lasting communities. It is anonymous and dispersed.Since there is no point in defying change, the question is whether such activities can be localised. As the acquisition of goods and services goes online, can local experiences replace them? Since the essence of human experience is contact with other people, the answer must surely be yes, if we help it to happen.The liveliest high streets I know are lined with coffee bars, beauty parlours, gyms and travel agents. The most celebrated “high street” in Los Angeles, Abbot Kinney Street, is just such a place – busy with health clubs, art galleries and now a cannabis boutique. Britain’s high streets are increasingly “alternative”, the charity shops in reality recycling plants. Some people even claim to take more goods to shops than they buy from them.With painful slowness, churches are emerging as secular meeting places. Thirty-five are already listed as post offices, others as bookshops, day centres and pick-up points for online shopping. They are starting to fill gaps left by the departure of other local services. One charity has turned a church in Ipswich into the local psychotherapy centre, an “experience” function that might be said to echo its original one.A high street is a community working. But government must be hypersensitive to its purpose. These places face an existential crisis. It is unbelievable that Whitehall can bias both taxation and planning decisions against them, in favour of housing. Houses will never build coherent societies without high streets. The issue is the weight democracy attaches to locality as against nationality. As the former House of Representatives speaker Tip O’Neill said, all politics is local. But so is all community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59dd7684a217a540b7e8f34ea0eb1ea6926fccb/0_1_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3628c936bdee3c5972eac8f9b1934b7a","title":"mp council housing labour mp kate osamor social tenant","story":"Britain’s acute housing crisis has been allowed to get ever worse, in part because the wrong targets are persistently scapegoated for it. Migrants are a long-running target, of course those deemed to be undeserving benefit claimants, such as teenagers mothers, are another traditional favourite. On one level, there is a perversely ingenious strategy at play. The more the government shrinks the nation’s council housing stock as a deliberate policy, the more those languishing on waiting lists feel as though they are competing for scarce resources, and the more they are incentivised to delegitimise other “competitors” as undeserving. The government is let off the hook.Which brings me to the case of Labour backbencher Kate Osamor, who spent Christmas enduring a media storm because she declared that she was “proud, not ashamed” to be a council tenant. This is a disgrace, apparently, because someone on a parliamentarian’s salary should free up their house for the more deserving. This line of argument is not only wrongheaded, it goes some way to explaining why a housing crisis has enveloped Britain.First things first: the architects of the nation’s housing crisis sit in No 10. Housebuilding is at its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s, and the failure to replace council housing flogged off under right to buy leaves 1.15 million families trapped on waiting lists. Rather than the “property-owning democracy” promised by Margaret Thatcher, home ownership has declined to 1980s levels, and is in a state of collapse among younger Britons. Four in 10 of the properties sold off under right to buy are now owned by private landlords charging twice as much as local authorities did. With fewer council houses available to rent, and a derisory number built under Tory rule, those who once would have been council tenants have been driven into an insecure, expensive private rental sector which has doubled in size over the past 25 years. The failure to build council housing means the taxpayer instead spends over £9bn a year subsidising private landlords charging rents people cannot afford.Some might argue that while all the above is true, if affluent social tenants like Osamor vacated their properties, that would surely ameliorate the housing crisis. Taking this argument on its own terms: no it would not. Government research in 2014 suggested that there were between 3,000 and 8,000 social households whose residents earned more than £80,000 a year: bear in mind that there are more than 4 million remaining social houses in England and Wales. Evicting affluent social tenants from their homes wouldn’t even amount to a pinprick on the housing crisis.But the logic of this argument is all wrong in any case. Nye Bevan’s ambitious postwar council house building programme rejected the idea that council housing should only be provided for those deemed to be “working class”. As he put it: “We should try to introduce in our modern villages and towns what was always the lovely feature of English and Welsh villages, where the doctor, the grocer, the butcher and the farm labourer all lived in the same street. I believe that is essential for the full life of a citizen … to see the living tapestry for a mixed community.”The assault on council housing has attempted to unpick this honourable dream. Instead, the diminishing stock is prioritised for those most in need. There are still council tenants from varied backgrounds: nurses, supermarket workers, care workers. But the residents of what remains of council housing disproportionately tend either to be elderly – often longstanding tenants who did not use “right to buy” – or those in the most difficult circumstances. It creates ghettos for the poor, rather than socially erse communities.This approach leads to the stigmatisation of social housing: their tenants are frequently demonised (one proffered “backronym” for “chavs” is “council housed and violent”), and younger people are encouraged to shun council housing in favour of a homeowning dream that becomes ever more distant. The destruction of the universalist principle behind public services – that everyone pays in and everyone gets something back – hurts the poorest the most. As the British social researcher Richard Titmuss put it, “services for the poor end up being poor services”.Osamor may have a large majority, but being an MP is hardly stable employment, and she got a council house when she was a homeless single parent. Are we saying that once those in the most adverse circumstances achieve a more comfortable standard of living, they are to be evicted from their family home? What the victimisation of Osamor underlines is the desperate need to reimagine council housing as an option for all.Bevan believed that council housing should be of a better standard than private housing. Today, that means everything from bigger living spaces – the British home is shrinking – to proper insulation to take on fuel poverty and combat climate change. If Osamor wanted to restrict council housing, then she would rightly be condemned as a hypocrite: but she doesn’t, she advocates a mass council housebuilding programme. That doesn’t mean Labour’s current plans are ambitious enough – they’re not. The Scottish and Welsh governments have suspended right to buy, given the mass depletion of council housing stock: Labour should demand the same in England. Labour should be pushed to commit to a higher proportion of council housing in its “million homes” commitment, too.We are supposed to live in a representative democracy, and parliament should look like the nation it serves. Accordingly, we should bemoan the fact that there are too few MPs who are social tenants, not that there are too many. Increasing the number would mean that the rights and needs of social tenants would be more likely to be championed, and that council housing would be forced higher up the political agenda.

Yes, the planet is boiling to death. And yes, the Brexit dream of empire 2.0 is hitting the skids because Britain keeps forgetting about its colonies from empire 1.0. But the public are talking about politics again – not just set-piece Westminster theatrics, but their own ability to transform the social forces that affect their lives. What the activist and writer Mark Fisher once called capitalist realism has been turned inside-out: devotees of neoliberal globalisation are today the exception rather than the rule. Ideas which were visionary just a few years ago – a four-day working week, universal basic income, a green new deal – are now serious policy proposals. Real power is being built outside of the establishment bubble, and that’s a good thing.In culture, Cardi B and Pusha T slew your faves (RIP Nicki Minaj and Drake) and brought back snarling rap to a genre dominated by identikit Soundcloud mumblers. Rosalía’s El Mal Querer and The Blaze’s Dancehall were accompanied by sumptuous visuals. The latter’s video for Territory, filmed in a crisply shot Algiers, is a spotlight on life at the margins of Fortress Europe the former’s video for Pienso En Tu Mirá manages to convey the tumult of a poisonous love affair in a set decked out like a basilica’s giftshop. In fact, 2018 has been so good for music that Beyoncé and her husband dropped an album and it’s not even my record of the year.More personally, it would be a dishonest piece if I didn’t mention the single most important thing that’s happened to me this year: learning to be happy alone, taking a vow of emotional celibacy, and then falling very smugly in love by accident. I wish I could tell you I’d had some kind of Damascene conversion while listening to Ariana Grande. In reality, there was just a cold dawning that perhaps the pursuit of men who on some level remind me of my absentee father isn’t a recipe for lasting joy or even particularly original. If you spent 2018 tapdancing for the validation of someone who you don’t even like very much, switch it up next year. Delete their number. Block them on Insta. Good things will happen.• Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media, and lectures in political theory at Anglia Ruskin and the Sandberg InstituutIn a year dominated by the epic idiot-circus that is Brexit, a glimpse of higher purity was offered by the World Chess Championship match held in London in November, between champion, Magnus Carlsen, and challenger, Fabiano Caruana. The indisputable highlight of the online coverage came when commentator Alexander Grischuk, a top Russian player, described playing in a basketball game against Carlsen a few years ago. Coming up against the larger Grischuk in defence, the super-competitive Carlsen couldn’t find any way around him. Until, as Grischuk revealed deadpan: “He started elbowing my balls.”Rock axe-botherers the world over became anxious in May when legendary American guitar-maker Gibson filed for bankruptcy but luckily it was merely for restructuring purposes, and they are continuing to build covetable instruments. I celebrated belatedly by acquiring a Gibson SG in a natural walnut finish, to join the two Gibson Les Pauls that I have this year publicly abused in some of London’s smallest e-bar venues. A guitar is the opposite of a smartphone: it is organic, beautiful, and environmentally sustainable, and it doesn’t make you stupid.The virtue of guitars was proven once again by Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher, when he was interviewed by Laura Barton this summer. He enjoys the “multi-generational aspect” of his gig audiences now. “I love to look out and see children on the shoulders of their parents,” he enthused. “One day I hope to see grandparents with their middle-aged children on their shoulders, and atop them their millennial kids who, in turn, bear the weight of their newborn offspring. Great, tottering towers of life, all singing along, head to toe in my fucking merch.” Gallagher is like King Arthur and the Dalai Lama combined, and would doubtless be a shoo-in in any direct election for an emergency prime minister. We can but hope.• Steven Poole is the author of Rethink, You Aren’t What You Eat, Unspeak, and Trigger HappyIt’s not surprising, perhaps, that bang in the middle of one of the grumpiest and most isive years in living memory, a moment of massed togetherness – with musical accompaniment, on a hot June night, with my niece and daughters – was one of my highlights. The love that filled Wembley stadium was for Taylor Swift on her Reputation tour, but we were all feeling it. When she paused halfway through New Year’s Day, which she sang on her own at the piano, the crowd started cheering into the silence, and didn’t stop. Affection and enthusiasm filled the evening alone on the huge stage, she looked momentarily overwhelmed. I’ve been to lots and lots of concerts (my husband is a pop critic), and have never experienced anything like it. So often fame at this level seems corrosive, dysfunctional. In her emotionally literate, commercial, diligent way, with an album and tour that are all about celebrity – in the aftermath of her humiliating public spat with Kanye West – Swift is trying to make superstardom work out for her. The tour film is on Netflix on New Year’s Eve.In the last few months I’ve made space in my life for yoga, after a gap of many years. I was so well-taught in my 20s – by a wonderful teacher, Silvia Prescott, who wrote in the  about her own teacher, the famous BKS Iyengar, after he died – that I can still do the poses, and am stiff in exactly the same places. If I hadn’t already done it, this would be my new year’s resolution.More women singing: Caroline, Or Change by Tony Kushner (with music by Jeanine Tesori) was the best play I saw this year, at Hampstead theatre (it’s now in the West End). The story is about an unhappy chapter of Kushner’s childhood, in rural Louisiana following the death of his mother. Sharon D Clarke plays Caroline – the family’s servant, who spends most of her days doing laundry in a sweltering basement. The music and the performances, the portrayal of black and Jewish lives rubbing up against each other in the 1960s deep south, the relationship between the boy and the woman, were so striking and artful as to be life-giving.This year was full of terrible events – we’re hurtling towards environmental destruction, mumble rap is very popular and makes no sense (see Lil Pump’s Gucci Gang), and Brexit is a never-ending disaster – but there are reasons to be cheerful.Another highlight in 2018 was the rediscovery of a “lost” John Coltrane record. A holy grail for jazz anoraks like myself, this 1963 recording of the saxophonist’s classic quartet was found in the basement of Coltrane’s ex-wife’s house and reissued in June. Over its six unreleased tracks, Both Directions at Once showcases the languorous beauty of Coltrane’s playing, cementing his status as a titan not only of the genre but of music in all its timelessness.Finally, I was cheered in 2018 by Neighbours. Not the people who live next door, but the long-running Australian soap. I may be the only person in the UK who still watches it daily and revels in the moral utopia of Ramsay Street a place where everyone knows your name and nothing bad ever really happens. But it’s for this reason I’m thankful that Neighbours (incredibly) hasn’t been cancelled. The show is a 30-minute void where your mind can empty to imbibe the sun-soaked optimism and hackneyed dialogue of its characters – it is mindfulness for the couch potato, another remedy for the over dramatisation of our lives.• Ammar Kalia is a  journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursaryA few pence on a shopping bag and the wider damning of plastic are bringing not only cleaner roads, but a return to paper. The high street is now a throng of colourful and clever design, as retailers come up with ever more distinctive carriers. Meanwhile, the refurbished loos at the local Marks \u0026amp Spencer have replaced their deafening and useless hot-air driers with good old-fashioned paper towels, Scandi-style. Which prompts the thought – romantic (and media dinosaur) that I am – that this rediscovery of paper could extend to the news industry, and a revival of the actual printed newspaper, alongside all the hi-tech stuff.Much of the UK basked in a long, warm summer – a glorious antidote to the agonies of Brexit. London took on a Mediterranean feel (in a good way). People looked happier there was no agonising over what to wear, colourful sundresses and shorts became the cheerful uniform (which also helped the economy because we had to buy more of them). You could actually plan a picnic. Bars and restaurants were full.It may have been a warning of the climate-change perils to come, but for a time it was possible to believe that just a little bit of sunshine might do us good.With an interest more in Russia than in football, I girded for the 2018 World Cup with foreboding. How would Russia, with its Soviet heritage, its ponderous bureaucracy, its lumbering transport system and – how shall we say? – its often unreconstructed attitude to exuberant free expression, cope with millions of foreign fans spread out over a dozen cities? I feared the worst – the worst being racist and homophobic chanting, even attacks, and heavy-handed police, quick to crack heads.But the worst didn’t happen. Legions of foreigners, British included, praised the efficiency of the organisation, the warmth of the hosts, and the gap between the dire warnings and their happy experience.I am not saying that Russia changed for ever overnight, nor that there has been no backsliding by officialdom since. But the 2018 World Cup gave a glimpse of a more relaxed, welcoming and modern Russia that would have been inconceivable even 10 years ago. And it fostered the hope that one day its leaders might come to trust the people and this Russia could prevail.• Mary Dejevsky is a writer and broadcasterAmid all the gloom this year, I was absolutely amazed by a visit I made in June to the labs of Prof Molly Stevens at Imperial College London. The biomedical research in which she and her remarkable team are engaged is – in the true sense of the word – awesome.From early diagnosis of HIV to advances in oncology that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, scientists such as Stevens are expanding the frontiers of medical knowledge and transforming the potentialities of health technology. Even as politics slides depressingly into polarised populism, and celebrities sell idiot pseudo-science, these warriors of human progress are the real deal.My own year was dominated by culture as editor of the new magazine Drugstore Culture, which launched in September: setting up such a venture with an extraordinary group of journalists has been a rare privilege in itself. In this context, it’s hard to pick out a single production or creative event – but I would give a special mention to Julius Caesar at London’s new Bridge theatre.What Nicholas Hytner and Nick Starr have achieved in this riverside palace of the imagination shows what can be accomplished by determination, enterprise and cultural agency. But this immersive production starring David Morrissey as Mark Antony and Ben Whishaw as Brutus – beginning with a scratch band of actors playing rock songs as audience members mingled in the forum – was particularly remarkable.For me, though, this was definitively the year in which today’s younger generation staked its claim to the political future. At the start of 2018, the People’s Vote campaign looked dangerously like the liberal elite asking for its job back by the end, its driving force were youth groups like For Our Future’s Sake and Our Future Our Choice, represented by eloquent tribunes such as Femi Oluwole, Will Dry and Lara Spirit.To characterise this cohort as losers or remoaners is a serious category error. They do not want to refight the 2016 referendum. Observing the spectacular failure of the Brexit project – mostly a failure of my age-group, Generation X – they want a say in their future.

The ducks, which e to find food, have also been trained to feed from submerged, floating feeding stations that only they can access.The pioneering reintroduction by the Wildfowl \u0026amp Wetlands Trust (WWT), Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Peregrine Fund and the Madagascan government comes 12 years after the apparently extinct species was rediscovered by chance.Lily-Arison Rene de Roland, the local director of the Peregrine Fund, was working on the conservation of another rare bird, the Madagascar harrier, when he spotted the duck on a remote crater lake high in the mountains. Tropical ducks are far less colourful than their northern counterparts because unpredictable weather means they need to be able to breed all year round and so the males do not acquire colourful feathers for annual mating rituals.Ornithologists soon realised that the last surviving 25 or so ducks were breeding successfully, but their ducklings were never reaching maturity because the lake was too deep and cold for the young birds to survive and find food.In 2009, Durrell, WWT and partners took one-day-old chicks from the lake to rear in captivity at a nearby breeding centre. The captive population has been painstakingly increased to 114 live birds today.According to Glyn Young, Durrell’s head of birds, the pochard declined to the brink of extinction because non-native fish species were introduced to Madagascar wetlands for fish farming. “It looks as though introduced fish across Madagascar are largely responsible for the decline of the duck,” he said.Carp released into the wetlands stirred up the water so the ing ducks could not find food so easily, and herbivorous fish such as tilapia stripped crucial vegetation from the lakes.In 2017, Scottish salmon farming cages were converted into the world’s first floating pre-release aviaries and shipped from the UK to Madagascar, where they were assembled on Lake Sofia this spring. The first ducklings were transferred to shore-based aviaries in October, and moved into the floating aviaries in early December. They are now swimming freely on the lake.It is hoped that the floating aviary and feeding stations will encourage the ducks to remain on Lake Sofia and breed. Conservationists have been working to ensure the habitat is more suitable than other lakes badly degraded by fish farming.Conservationists said the support of the local community living around the lake – who depend on it for fish – had been vital to the project.WWT’s head of conservation breeding, Nigel Jarrett, said: “Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.“If we can make this work, it will provide a powerful example not just of how to save the planet’s most threatened species, but how communities can manage an ecosystem to benefit people and wildlife, especially in areas of significant poverty.”Young added: “The restoration programme at Lake Sofia will encourage others in Madagascar to no longer look at the island’s wetlands as lost causes. They may once again be centres of bioersity while continuing to support communities of people who have also come to depend on them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f1b4547a676e96f76f0738b7087cd1df0dbf1ee/1280_4273_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d787ef13d28e221cbbe89e05c739d115","title":"how to wear cinderella sandals new years eve","story":"Your last dressy night in a while is not the time to buy something new, so wear the party heels you already ownHow likely are you, on a scale of one to five, with one being very likely and five being don’t be utterly ridiculous, to be wearing high-heeled sandals to see in the new year? I’m reading a solid three. I can work with that.Here are a few reasons why you should consider wearing shoes like this for New Year’s Eve. One: after this, it’s January. This is it, people. Come midnight, it’s all over. The festive spirit will evaporate, like Cinderella’s carriage. Wear those glass slippers while you can. This is not about a dress code, it’s about a ritual. You are going to be in boots and jeans for January (and yoga leggings and running trainers: that’s the plan, anyway). New Year’s Eve is to January what Shrove Tuesday is to lent. Eat up all the glamour, while you still can.Two: New Year’s Eve, like Christmas Day, has its own fashion weather system. You don’t have to concern yourself overly with trends. In fact, in general, the golden rule for a successful new year is not to overcomplicate it. Instead of trying to venue-hop when it’s freezing cold, transport costs a fortune and you are at the mercy of precision timing, pick a team for the night and stick with it. Rather than trying to matchmake or attempt to reconcile with a long-lost best friend on a night when emotions run high anyway, stick with the core squad and keep the thermostat at jolly. If you are cooking, don’t make this the night you attempt a souffle for the first time your friends want to hang out with you, not watch you sob into the oven, and nobody really cares so long as you have cold alcohol. There is no more tried-and-tested eveningwear formula than a dress with shoes that bring the party.Three: you have these shoes, or something very similar, already. I have had these Jimmy Choo sandals for about eight years, and they are as good as new. The good thing about taxi shoes – which these very much are – is that not wearing them outside means they stay in good shape for longer. (The exception is a snappable heel. Slender straps but a heel with the heft of an upturned Snickers bar is the ideal combination for a party sandal.)Your last dressy night in a while is not the time to buy something new, so wear the party heels that you already own – which come with the added bonus that you don’t start the new year with new-shoe blisters.One last thing. People are disproportionately impressed by the hardiness implied by high heels without tights, in winter. You don’t need to make a souffle, you don’t need to stay up to see the sunrise. You can just wear a nice pair of heels. And you can take them off at midnight. Happy days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9057a84c3cbb7954a95ab2f6617ac383872fa27/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46264a0ae6059237097d1f5339111d10","title":"the 10 best jumpers in pictures","story":"Beat the chill in a hot knit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e58c20fcb69fecaf59c27229bc7168613774d95/352_432_4218_2531/master/4218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c11154d64d79260b0e6fe5c16f20bf","title":"keira knightley i cant act flirt or mother to get voice heard","story":"The star of Colette on Harvey Weinstein, Disney princesses and why her visceral essay about childbirth and the Duchess of Cambridge hit a nerveWhen Keira Knightley was small there were two things she knew she would become. First, an actor. That worked out. She got an agent at six was in Star Wars at 13 and Pirates of the Caribbean at 17 won an Oscar nomination for Pride and Prejudice at 20 and another, 10 years later, for The Imitation Game. Second, a man. That’s still a work in progress.“I remember everything about that feeling,” she says, now 33, folded up on a sofa in a London hotel. A big blue frock juts out from under her like a nest. “That girls grew into men, and that’s what I was going to be.” Toddler logic, she admits goodness knows what boys became. “Maybe it was that the girls were the most powerful in the playground. They were in charge and, obviously, the men were in charge outside. So clearly that’s where I was going. Only, of course it wasn’t.”Knightley scrunches her face: a chipmunk photobombing a supermodel. Still, she was a grade-A tomboy: no skirts, leading a protest at school until girls were allowed to play football. At 11, she was “obsessed by The Godfather. I wanted to be Al Pacino and that’s where I was heading. The great parts are the guys’ parts. You don’t want to be the pretty girl in the corner or the mum being lovable and supportive. Of course, when you grow up you are, but you still want to have the adventures.”Knightley’s entire career, from ball-busting breakthrough in Bend it Like Beckham to cross-dressing, trans-romancing Colette in her new film, has been an attempt to have adventures her younger self would respect. To explore if not what it would be like to be a man, then certainly “the masculine side of the female, stuck in the dresses and makeup. Almost every character I’ve played has tried to break out of that image of femininity. That’s why I like period films, because it’s such an overt cage you put the woman in. That’s always something I’ve really identified with. I feel like I sit somewhere else.”I look quizzical. “I’ve never wanted a penis,” she clarifies. “Apart from to piss up a tree. Being able to do that standing up: so convenient. You can just whip it out and whatever. But the idea of something so vulnerable swinging between my legs, I think I’m all right without.”Generally, it can be tricky encouraging stars away from unpacking art to chatting genitals. With Knightley, it’s like turning on a tap. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone simultaneously so famous and so garrulous (she’s also bracingly sweary). Or perhaps it’s something only those who have been A-listers more than half their life already can get away with.A few days after we meet, Knightley appears on Ellen DeGeneres’s chatshow to promote The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and mentions she has banned her young daughter, Edie (with husband James Righton, frontman of the new-rave band Klaxons), from watching the Disney classics Cinderella and A Little Mermaid because of their dodgy feminist messages. Twitter entered white-heat mode. Thinkpieces were spewed out like ticker tape. Presumably Disney – which also made The Nutcracker, which has since flopped – weren’t thrilled. But when asked about it again a fortnight later, instead of calming the waters, she went in with a whisk: doubling down on her argument with some PhD-level Disney princess knowledge.Still, she says in December when we speak again on the phone, being up for a fight doesn’t mean you want a punch. “I thought I was just being perky in an interview. My God, people feel really strongly. Don’t fuck with Cinderella. Her fans will end you.”Anyway, back to Colette. It’s the latest film from Wash Westmoreland, who made Still Alice with his husband, Richard Glatzer, before the latter died of ALS (also known as motor neurone disease) a fortnight after Julianne Moore’s Oscar win for lead actress. They co-wrote this one, too, and it’s clearly the work of a couple: intimate, barbed and funny. The plot revolves around Colette and her literary entrepreneur husband Willy (Dominic West), who pass off her novels as his, until Colette starts resenting the fiction, and Willy’s hypocritical jealousy over her affairs with a Louisiana heiress (Poldark’s Eleanor Tomlinson) and a gender-fluid aristocrat (Denise Gough) who never removes her suit. By and large, men fare badly. But Willy is, like Colette, finely drawn, charming for all his ludicrosity. In one scene, he wins his wife back by explaining that men are the weaker sex, slaves to their biology, ergo his endless shagging.“The Weaker Sex” is also the withering title of an essay Knightley wrote for a collection called Feminists Don’t Wear Pink And Other Lies, published in October. At the time, it caused a stink for what some perceived as an attack on the Duchess of Cambridge for looking glam hours after the birth of her daughter. Was she surprised? “The whole essay was about the silencing of women’s experience. So it’s interesting that’s exactly what happened from certain media outlets. They turned a moment of empathy from one body to another around to say: she’s shaming her.”Yet women seemed just as mean as men. “Yeah, that’s interesting. Internalised misogyny? I’m not criticising that. All of us respond to and survive within the culture in the way that we can. But I think we need to have a big look at ourselves.”Indeed. The duchess section is actually the blandest part of a blazing manifesto that starts with Knightley’s vagina splitting, swiftly brings in blood, poo, cracked nipples and incontinence pads, then closes with a broadside against male colleagues:“They tell me what it is to be a woman. Be nice, be supportive, be pretty but not too pretty, be thin but not too thin, be sexy but not too sexy, be successful but not too successful. … But I don’t want to flirt and mother them, flirt and mother, flirt and mother. I don’t want to flirt with you because I don’t want to fuck you, and I don’t want to mother you because I am not your mother. … I just want to work, mate. Is that OK? Talk and be heard, be talked to and listen. Male ego. Stop getting in the way.”The essay, says Knightley, was “just sort of vomited out”, submitted in a “fuck it” moment, published “because we have to harness this moment in time and use our voices to keep the conversation going. Because we’re saddled with a system built on inequality,” she says, “progress is going to be slow and painful and uncomfortable. But I want to make sure I’m not raising my daughter in fear of the whole other half of the human race. Just as it’s important to raise boys seeing the whole of a woman’s experience, not simply one aspect of femininity. Otherwise, how can you respect it?”The core problem, she reckons, is that the voices of a generation of women are lost to childcare. This means – to bring it back to straying Willy – that “we all empathise with men hugely because, culturally, their experience is so explored. We know so many aspects of even male sexuality. But we don’t feel like men can say: ‘Yes, I understand what you’re talking about because I’ve got this wealth of art and film and theatre and TV from your point of view.’”So if women don’t come on flirty or maternal, she thinks, some men get stumped. “Before motherhood, you’re sexy, but if we talk about the whole vagina-splitting thing then that’s terrifying there’s no sex there, so what we do is go into the virgin-mother retrofit, that’s nice and safe. The problem with those two images is I think very few women actually identify with them. Women are meant to play the flirt or the mother in order to get their voice heard. I can’t. It makes me feel sick.””On set, she was informed by a male director – not Westmoreland – exactly what she was: not passive-aggressive, but openly aggressive. Her eyes pop recalling the shock. “I thought that was extraordinary. I hadn’t raised my voice, I hadn’t sworn, I simply disagreed with a point. And this was someone I liked.”Look back over Knightley’s previous press and what sticks out – more, even, than her habit of irritating people by dint of crimes including her looks and niceness – is her composure. She has always seemed poised, someone of conviction and confidence, if not arrogance. Bumblings have been low-key she has kept it together.Not without effort, it turns out. Earlier this year, she told the Hollywood Reporter that she had had a breakdown aged 22, following five years of endless exposure. She didn’t leave the house for three months. A therapist said she was her first client who wasn’t being paranoid when she worried about people following her. She needed hypnotherapy to feel able to walk the Baftas red carpet for Atonement in 2007.The other reason Knightley speaks her mind is it would never occur to her not to. The perception is that she hails from high privilege. But her schooling was bog-standard her parents – playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley – thespy, but also relatively radical leftwing types. Not quite hippies, says Knightley, but as close as Teddington in south-west London probably got. She says she hadn’t realised how lucky she was to be raised by a father who loved the fact his wife often earned more than he did.In the film she is currently shooting, Misbehaviour, she plays Sally Alexander, a women’s libber among those who invaded the stage at Miss World 1970 with football rattles and flour bombs. Watch footage of the real Alexander today and you could be watching an older Knightley. These are her people: arty but determined, polite but forthright.And that, perhaps, is why Knightley’s pronouncements don’t – for me at least – stick in the throat. So much political rhetoric trotted out by film stars smacks of the bandwagon: rote homilies, recited without too much consideration.Knightley sings from a more sophisticated hymn sheet. Take Miss World. Plainly, she’s not a fan: “I’d never seen a beauty competition before but you think, wow this is really out there! The way they turn their arses and the cameras panning up and down. The way society as a whole goes: ‘Oh no, this is fine.’”But while the actions of Alexander et al were “amazingly brave”, she’s not sure she would have done the same, because the contestants felt they were being attacked. “That was unfair. And having been on stage, if something like that happened it would be utterly terrifying.”She is even measured when I asked about Harvey Weinstein, giving “credit where credit’s due he was very good at getting independent cinema an audience”. They had most contact around the time of The Imitation Game, when she wasn’t remotely in need of patronage, and pregnant – both reasons he didn’t try it on, she thinks. “And maybe he just didn’t fancy me, could be as simple as that.”She swears ignorance over his alleged assaults. “I absolutely knew he was a womaniser, because you could see it. But I thought that was consensual, and I’d never heard he’d raped anybody. Everyone knew he was a bully because he would scream and shout. But it wasn’t obvious he was doing what he was doing with the bathrobe and the massage and the pot plant. The pot plant!”Such as? “About their sexuality, how they see us, exactly what they want. It’s a really tricky discussion but I don’t know how we move forward without engaging men. And you can’t hate them if you’re trying to do that.” A pause, another grimace: scepticism made flesh. “Also: they’re nice. I know some really lovely ones.”• Colette is released on 12 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0eae29c599ac7f0f7b0c3d713777b7506eed5bc/87_49_2645_1586/master/2645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60281cd988a19f088ff665bde15d0b6d","title":"whats next for film criticism on the bbc barry norman","story":"After the long, slow death of the Beeb’s flagship Film show, a radical rethink is needed if the public broadcaster’s claims it takes movies seriously are to be believedFor the Film programme, it’s been a long goodbye. The BBC’s flagship film show for TV has been on its deathbed for a long time now. Running for only a few months a year, with a rotating and sometimes rather desultory-looking list of presenters, it has had a variable and very late time slot. Indeed, its own producers were sometimes left in the dark by BBC executives about what exactly was the plan for a programme that still had a devoted following.Its glory days, by common consent, were in the 70s, 80s and 90s when it was hosted by the avuncular, rumpled, lovable – and extremely knowledgable – Barry Norman, who like Michael Parkinson was part of a generation of presenters recruited from the ranks of print journalism. His catchphrase, invented for him by Spitting Image, caught the public imagination because it fitted Barry’s easygoing, open-minded attitude to criticism … “and why not?” Norman’s good-humoured and intelligent movie broadcasting was the introduction to film for generations of movie goers: the only uncomfortable thing about the long-running programme was the title. Take away the year and you’re not sure what to call it: Film … ? The Film programme? It’s said that the year you find yourself putting on it subconsciously reveals how young you believe yourself to be. I call it Film 91. I loved the show I loved Barry’s interviews with the stars, which came from an era before that in which actors were on autopilot for junket publicity tours. Barry had a wonderfully flirtatious encounter with Michelle Pfeiffer and a memorably frosty one with Robert De Niro. We all loved the genial way Barry would regularly hand over to Tom Brook for “industry” news from New York (Brook still presents BBC World News’s show Talking Movies).Then in the noughties, it was the more glamorous (and no less knowledgeable) figure of Jonathan Ross. After that, in 2010, it was Claudia Winkleman – an extremely smart arts presenter who like Ross included this gig with a portfolio of high-profile presenting jobs, but unlike Ross had to face regular misogynist condescension online. When Winkleman took over, the show had been re-thought in a more discussion-oriented approach, chatting with her regular resident critic Danny Leigh, and with guest reviewers. When she left in 2016, and you could feel the BBC taking its hands off the corporate steering wheel.The BBC has promised to replace Film with another show, but the challenge is how do you cover movies for a BBC One audience? The problem the BBC has is that movie broadcasting has been subject to a populist online revolution. There has been an explosion of podcasts and YouTube channels, many brilliant, and as in so many other areas of broadcasting, the BBC is wondering how to accommodate this new reality. Whatever happens, with either a single presenter, or a group format, it should be on all the year round, and in a non-insomniac slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c37864de026c48d31a703c4778c208dabf36a02/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70c6ff2e33df1ebd8ead74bbead06b56","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Things could get worse for Manchester City before they get better and Kyle Walker-Peters poses a few questions for Mauricio PochettinoMaurizio Sarri started the festive period by publicly guaranteeing that Ruben Loftus-Cheek would get some significant first-team action before the new year festivities die down. “We have to play every three days so one match he will be in the starting XI for sure,” he said. On Boxing Day Sarri left Loftus-Cheek out of the squad entirely for the victory over Watford, but if the player himself could have chosen which fixture he would appear in it would surely have been the return to Selhurst Park, where he shone on loan last season. When the clubs met at Stamford Bridge in November Loftus-Cheek spent the entire afternoon on the bench, hearing one set of fans – in the away end – sing his name. “To hear them sing my name was a warming feeling,” he said. “It was good to see some familiar faces. It would have been nice to come on, but hopefully I will get to play against Palace next time.” He has started one of eight league games since, and though Sarri has said “there is no chance” of him leaving in January another afternoon of inactivity against a club managed by Roy Hodgson – who pledged that “there’s always a place for you here” – might at least make him consider his options. SBAlthough it is not long since Manchester City walloped Southampton 6-1, the champions would be unwise to assume that it will be a walk in the park when they visit St Mary’s on Sunday. Given that Southampton’s new manager has been nicknamed the Alpine Klopp, the champions cannot afford to show any complacency after faltering against Palace and Leicester. Ralph Hasenhüttl has already inconvenienced Arsenal with his energetic pressing style and the Austrian will relish the opportunity to pit his wits against Pep Guardiola’s possession game. City, who have endured a troubled festive period, will have to be ready to run hard as they attempt to close ground on Liverpool at the top of the table. JSIt was heartening to see Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain step up his recovery on Christmas Eve, the 25-year-old posting a photo of him punching the air in delight as he took to training on grass for the first time in eight months. The visit of Arsenal to Anfield this Saturday (and this week’s claim that the reason the Gunners didn’t often start him was because they had to pay Southampton £10,000 every time he played more than 20 minutes) brings the midfielder back into focus regarding what his absence means to both teams. Liverpool seem to be coping rather well without the England man, but how Arsenal could do with his confidence, energy and directness now in an inconsistent midfield. With Mesut Özil withdrawn at half-time in Brighton “for tactical reasons”, Granit Xhaka and Matteo Guendouzi inconsistent, Henrikh Mkhitaryan injury and Aaron Ramsey seemingly with one foot out of the door, it remains a mystery who Unai Emery will choose to combat the league leaders. One suspects a fully-fit Oxlade-Chamberlain is exactly the sort of player than Unai Emery would love to have in his ranks. MB• Liverpool v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm• Emery faces touchline ban after being hit with FA charge for kicking bottleThe bald facts facing the ision’s bottom two sides, Fulham and Huddersfield, are these: over the last 20 years a total of 12 teams have had fewer than 12 points after Boxing Day, and of those dozen, eight ended the season at the bottom of the league. Only two teams have recovered from such a dismal first half of the season to survive: West Bromwich Albion in 2004-05, whose miracle escape was completed only because of an 82nd-minute last-day equaliser for Charlton against Crystal Palace, and a decade later Leicester, the exception to all rules, who managed to finish 14th and were league champions a year later. It is, in other words, rare for teams to do as badly as Fulham and Huddersfield have in the first half of a season, and having done so it is extremely likely to prove fatal. Huddersfield, currently bottom, face the teams at the moment occupying 19th, 18th and 17th places in their next three league matches, something of a post-Christmas extended relegation 18-pointer if their current run of six consecutive defeats is still going in mid-January then, as in many households over Christmas, their goose will surely be cooked. SBBy the end of it, you get the feeling that Ed Woodward himself could have motivated Manchester United’s players better than José Mourinho. The relief around Old Trafford is palpable after José’s exit and Olé’s entrance has coincided with Alexis Sánchez’s return from Chile, where he was taking an extended break to deal with his injury. Sánchez was at Old Trafford to watch the Huddersfield win – it now seems a fire has been lit under the former Arsenal man, even to the extent that he was at Carrington on his days off on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Solskjær said Sánchez could be fit enough to feature against Bournemouth on Sunday but will at Newcastle on the 2 January. It’s up to United’s attackers this weekend to maintain their recent form and make sure it’s not their spot that Sánchez nabs in the north-east. MBOne of the most worrying features of Burnley’s alarming decline has been their loss of organisation at the back. Sean Dyche’s side have forgotten how to keep their opponents out at the moment – Everton did not have to work particularly hard to put five past them on Boxing Day – and their suffering is likely to continue if there is no improvement when West Ham visit Turf Moor on Sunday. Yet perhaps one way for Dyche to help his players regain their defensive discipline would be by shedding his loyalty to Joe Hart. Dropping the former England goalkeeper would be a bold call, but Hart has started all of Burnley’s league games this season and has been a prominent part of one of the ision’s leakiest rearguards. Given that Burnley have even become a soft touch at set-pieces, it could be time for Hart to make way for Tom Heaton, who deserves a chance to show that he is too good to be on the bench. JSIt is strange to think that Claude Puel was reportedly on the verge of losing his job a week ago. Leicester have bought their manager plenty of breathing space with stunning victories over Chelsea and City since then and they have a chance to tighten their grip on seventh place when they host Cardiff City on Saturday. Yet while they will be expected to beat a team yet to win on their travels this season, it will be interesting to see if Leicester are capable of passing a different kind of test against Neil Warnock’s strugglers. There will be no pressure on Cardiff to open up. They will know that Leicester can strain for inspiration when moderate opponents choose to sit deep and play on the break. Puel, whose critics have been silenced for now, might need creative players like James Maddison to step up to the plate. JSRafa Benítez’s team selection for the Boxing Day game at Anfield – Isaac Hayden, Yoshinori Muto and Joselu made their second, fifth and also fifth starts of the season, while a handful of first-team regulars were rested – left him something of a hostage to fortune for the trip to Watford, having (not unreasonably) identified this match as more winnable. But perhaps the key name missing from the team at Liverpool has only made seven starts himself in 11 matches this season without Fabian Schär on the pitch Newcastle have taken three points at the rate of 0.27 per game in eight games with the Swiss centre-back on the field they have snaffled 14 points at 1.75 per match. The run started against Watford in early November, when an injury to Jamaal Lascelles saw Schär – who had not made a first-team appearance in over two months – come off the bench at half-time, with Newcastle scraping their first win of the season. Watford meanwhile dominated, especially in the first half, at St James’ Park and only their woeful finishing saved Newcastle from defeat, so Javi Gracia’s side will feel they have a score to settle here. SBChris Hughton must be relieved to have his preferred centre-back pairing back of Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk available once again. Three defeats have passed since Duffy was sent off during the win over Crystal Palace, and although he returned for the draw against Arsenal on Boxing Day, Dunk’s own suspension saw him replaced by Leon Balogun, who directly contributed to Arsenal’s opening goal by giving the ball away – twice – on the edge of his own area. Saturday’s opponents at the Amex, Everton, have been inconsistent of late but have not struggled to score goals, with their last away day yielding five goals at Burnley. The form of Mat Ryan in goal and the emergence of Bernardo at left-back has been a big plus defensively for Hughton but without their first-choice 6ft4in giants Brighton look suspect defensively and will be eager to register their first clean sheet since October against Everton.

Dowell, a lanky fellow with the most magic of magic wands where his left foot should be, was in the England Under-20 side that won the 2017 World Cup, and was intermittently impressive when Nottingham Forest borrowed him last season. Marca tend to take some pretty outlandish flyers on some stories, but their latest offering makes sense: they report that Cesc Fabregas is set to leave Chelsea, possibly in January. His contract expires next summer so he’s free to negotiate with who he bladdy well likes, but he might try to bust his way out of there before that. Marca isn’t specific on where he’s off, other than to say it will be in Europe. Any idle speculation? More importantly, the  has just announced our footballer of the year: it’s Khadjia ‘Bunny’ Shaw, who you can read all about in this remarkable interview with Bryan Arnhem Graham here:A reminder of the criteria for this award: it’s not the best footballer in the world. We dealt with those here and here.  Footballer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Shaw is our third winner following Fabio Pisacane in 2016 and Juan Mata in 2017.Hello. Nick back in the seat now. Remember, emails or tweets on your game of the year, or your footballing highlowlight of the festive season to Nick.Miller.casual@the or @NickMiller79.Just like Georges-Kévin N’Koudou, after that brief cameo I will be passing you back to Nick Miller and shall return later... Linn Krämer emails in regarding some ghosts of transfer windows past for Mauricio Pochettino and Tottenham. “I am a Spurs fan from Israel. I noticed you have not mentioned some players in Spurs provisional squad, and wondered why we have not seen or hear anything about George Kevin-Nkoudu and Vincent Janssen (who does not even have a shirt number this season, and the club did not supply any updates regarding his injury) this season ...I think these players should have had another chance by Poch who wasn’t patient enough with Sissoko and now he is our best CM. “I think Poch is really desperate for some transfer activity and by completely ignoring them he is making sure some activity on the exit front, and then hopefully some incomings.”Word on the street, via the always clued-up and plugged-in Rumour Mill, is that both are effectively on the transfer list and a) reduce the squad a little and b) help raise some money for a potential January signing. That said, completely take the point re: Sissoko and his upturn in form but we knew he can be good (albeit sporadically) before this season. Nkoudou played 26 minutes in a Carabao Cup tie in October following a largely underwhelming loan spell at Burnley. Added to Érik Lamela’s return to regular first-team football and Lucas Moura’s successful adaptation to English football, not sure where he fits in. I’ve long lived on Vincent Janssen island (inhabitants: 2) but Pochettino seems to prefer Fernando Llorente in the ‘Harry Kane Replacement’ role, and even has Son to play through the middle as well. The Dutchman has also been linked with Celtic, with the Scottish champions a little light on strikers at the moment. Eden Hazard is apparently perturbed Maurizio Sarri keeps playing him through the centre as opposed to his favoured left-side. Well, it doesn’t look like things will be changing for the Belgian (unless Chelsea make the slightly silly decision to sign Gonzalo Higuaín) with the Chelsea manager speaking earlier...I cannot see the problem of Hazard in this role, he played four matches as false number nine, and he scored three goals and two assists. I am really very happy with him in this position, because he’s very able to score, first of all, but he’s very able to open spaces for the team-mates, to come and play with the team-mates. So at the moment I am very happy with him in this position, but in the future he can also play as a winger of course. I don’t know if he prefers to play as a winger or a striker, but if he is able to play in the last match in the centre for me it’s not a problem to put him in the centre.Hit me with your festive football highlightslowlightsfears so far, whether at games or munching leftovers in the comfort of your own homes. Mine was a visit to Privett Park where Gosport Borough beat Basingstoke Town 3-2. Not only a decent game with a fine winner by Pat Suraci but was blown away by the array of sauces on offer alongside the half-time burgers. The four saucemen of ketchup, brown sauce, mustard and mayo were present as standard, but on top of that, get a load of this lineup: Happy to be proven wrong, but that is Premier League standard in terms of condiment choice.And, at the risk of sounding like a grizzled old football cynic, it looks like Lucas Hernandez will almost certainly be signing for Bayern Munich at some stage. The Atlético Madrid defender and World Cup winner was linked last week in an €80m transfer (his release clause), which the Spanish club issued a statement to deny, and then Lucas goes and says all this...There are a lot of clubs in Europe that make me dream, but I will not tell you who and I’m fine good in Madrid. But if I have to leave tomorrow because a project interests me, I would consider it.I have to think about the pros and cons one to make the best possible decision for me, my family and my career.Afternoon all, James taking over from Nick here. Granted, it’s not quite Didier Ndong to Guingamp (interesting the Google translate in that tweet below describes him as an “international box-to-box environment”) but Marca appear to be pretty definite today that Manchester City’s Brahim Díaz is following Jadon Sancho out of the door marked ‘lack of first-team opportunities’ at the Etihad and is signing for Real Madrid in a few days for £15m ... keen for thoughts from City fans. Here’s Manuel Pellegrini being nice about Declan Rice:I see Declan work every day and so it is difficult for me to be surprised by him now. He always wants to learn more, he hasn’t had any problems, he has just been focusing on playing. Then the media started about his contract and his money, but he has never had any problem in that sense. He is always, always working hard and he is just 19 years old. He’s a player who always wants to learn more, and he has got such a bright future ahead of him.Here’s Sean Dyche, manager of relegation strugglers Burnley, who find themselves in the bottom three and with an eye-wateringly bad defensive record. Only Fulham have conceded more than their 41 goals, and they’ve already let in two more than they did in exactly double the number of games over the whole of last season. We know there’s a lot of work to be done. We’ve never overthought it. We’ve got to shift the performance levels and we’ve got to stay strong to our beliefs. We defended so well last season and clearly this season at some points we haven’t done. It has to be addressed and it is being. I’m not stupid, I know our stats. It’s always a challenge season on season getting all the details right. The key moments at both ends of the pitch, you have to be deadly at one end and safe as houses at the other, and we haven’t got that balance right.Thing is, this sounds an awful lot like the sort of stuff Dyche has been saying all season, and things don’t seem to be improving. He reckoned their performances were getting better and said they were good against Tottenham and Arsenal, which was true to a point, but then they got hosed 5-1 at home by Everton. They’ve got West Ham on Sunday. Big one. Remember Didier Ndong? The Gabon midfielder that Sunderland sacked earlier this season after he, erm, misinterpreted attendance at training as being an optional extra rather than a relatively basic part of the job?After a few months without a club it sounds like he’s found new employment, with French side Guingamp announcing they have agreed a deal in principle to sign him. This is conditional on sorting out some form of compensation with Sunderland, and of course passing a medical, which might be a little more stringent than your average given he hasn’t played a game since January and has been without a club since September. It’s the Old Firm this weekend, with Rangers looking for their first win over Celtic since Brendan Rodgers arrived a couple of years ago. Or, depending on how you want to frame it, since they returned to the Scottish top flight in 2016.“We’re playing against a good team who’ll be well-drilled. We know that we have to bring our best to get the result we want,” said Rangers manager Steven Gerrard, sort of talking like his boys are coming up against some sort of stodgy mid-table outfit like Stoke, rather than the team who have won the last nine league titles. Meanwhile, there will only be around 750 Celtic fans in attendance, after Rangers cut the away allocation from the usual 7,000-odd due to ‘safety concerns.’ “My feeling always is that it is better in both grounds whenever both sets of supporters are there,” said Rodgers. “However, they are not. There will be about 750 of our supporters there. “We hope the whole game can pass safely and there’s no issues around that and it is just the football. But it can work for and against you as the home team in that situation, when you have predominately the support in the ground. It can add something to the players either a positive or a negative.”Good news from Italy, where the racism suffered by Kalidou Koulibaly during Napoli’s game against Inter the other day is being treated with the requisite seriousness by authorities at the highest leve...oh, no, wait. The country’s deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, appeared on Italian TV last night and said: Racism is the stuff of idiots in 2018, but let’s not put everything in the same pot. In the stadiums they also sing ‘Milan in flames’, would that be racism too?Bonucci was booed by the Milan fans, is that racism? Healthy teasing among fans is not to be considered racism.What would I say to Koulibaly? That I’d love to see him in a Milan shirt though, he’s very strong.With thanks to Football Italia for the translation. Let’s try this: how about your nominations for the game of the year. I nominate Roma 3-0 Barcelona, when the Italian side started 4-1 down and with barely a hope against a Barca team who basically thought all they needed to do was rock up and claim their semi-final spot. Here’s the highlights, featuring what I like to call Peak Peter Drury. I ask you to pay particular attention to Alessandro Florenzi’s reaction straight after the winner: genuine, unfiltered disbelief, with not a clue what to do with himself. Marvellous.And here’s the  report from the day:We’ve been running a series of pieces as the year stumbles to a close about the various flashpoints of 2018. Here are the football ones:Sid Lowe, on ‘Julen the Brief’, a man who had and lost the two biggest jobs in Spanish football within five months.Andy Hunter, on Sergio Ramos going all WWE on Mo Salah’s shoulder during the Champions League final.Here’s an extract from John Arne-Riise’s new book. It is, as you will presumably be delighted to hear, about the time Craig Bellamy attacked him with a golf club. Bellamy...doesn’t come out of this well.A short interlude to say that if you’re one of the many masochists with a Twitter account, you really must follow @Ftbllrswanimals - it’s a simple concept, in that it only posts pictures of footballers posing with animals. It’s one of social media’s basic, uncomplicated joys.Suzy Wrack’s latest investigation into the abuse allegations surrounding the Afghanistan women’s football team is pretty shocking. Have a read:The burning question in Brighton at the moment is who will keep goal while Maty Ryan is off with the Australia squad at the Asian Cup. They signed a couple of goalies in the summer - David Button from Fulham and Jason Steele from Sunderland - so Chris Hughton is faced with the agony of choice:I’ll make the decision as to who replaces Maty. There’s nothing that happens in the goalkeeping department that I don’t know about. I want a tough decision and both keepers have worked really hard, pushing Maty to his high levels.Karl Gibbons would like to big up Manuel Pellegrini: “This season I have been to see West Ham play a few times (not my club but with a season ticket-holding friend) and they have been very good, yet I feel that Pellegrini has not had any of the media hoo-haa that other managers (Gracia, Silva, Howe et al) get for their exploits. Granted, he has already proven himself over his career and doesn’t need any media backing, but I thought I would email you to that end anyway. “They are also working with a huge list of injured players. Also, Declan Rice is quality and the fact that West Ham will not stump up the cash to give him a bumper contract is very surprising.”You may have seen yesterday that Bournemouth captain Simon Francis has banjaxed his cruciate ligament, and will thus miss the rest of the season. Clearly, bad news, but it might be worse for him, in that there’s a reasonable chance this will be it for his substantive career with the Cherries: he’ll be 34 in February, his contract runs out next summer and while you’d like to think his remarkable service to the club will warrant some sort of reward, you wonder how much they will be able to rely on him as a regular starter. At the very least, Bournemouth should be in the market for a new defender in January. Dejan Lovren reckons Liverpool are pretty good, you won’t be surprised to hear.“I think experience,” the 29-year-old said when asked what this Liverpool team possess that previous sides did not. “There are quite a lot of players still here and it was like a puzzle, you just keep bringing these players you missed and now I think it’s a perfect match. You feel that in the squad, it’s how it should be. There has always been something missing all these years but I think now we have everything.”He added: “It’s more only about us and that’s how we should do it always. We have learned from all these previous seasons.”Some tactical chat from John Delaney (presumably not that John Delaney), also featuring booze.“I had a weird dream over Christmas that the 4-4-2 made a comeback. Obviously too much rich food and whisky... I’m going for a nice country walk today before I go peculiar.”If you missed it, Eden Hazard is keeping his eyes on the prizethe football this term before thinking about any potential transfer to Real Madrid, or wherever, in the summer. To be fair I’m just focused on the pitch, and we’ll see at the end of the season.Then he was asked about his form...I’m scoring more goals, I don’t feel I’m playing better, I’m just scoring more goals. I don’t know why, maybe I’m just nearer to the goal. My position is winger. I feel better as a winger, but today I did well as a striker, and against Brighton I did well as a striker. The manager chooses where to put me on the pitch and then I try to do my best.If you score 100 you want to score more, so I’ll try to score more goals. I’ve scored a couple of good ones through the years, so I can’t choose my favourite.Here are some words from Mauricio Pochettino about the new Tottenham stadium, and how that will help his boys.We cannot ask more from our fans, they are doing a fantastic job. The circumstances of that period in the club, we need to be strong and we cannot complain about all that happened. It was not easy to get to Wembley on public transport, it’s not easy. Maybe they were our fans, but many fans that have come in this period have visited London and, like a theatre, they say, ‘Oh it’s a game at Wembley, I’m going to buy a ticket.’ It’s normal, but our fans feel and they try to increase the atmosphere of the club or the game, but we have a limit too. Our fans tried to increase the atmosphere of the game but in a 90,000 stadium we are limited to 51,000. On Boxing Day we had 45,000. We can’t complain, we need to be stronger and try to deliver our best job.”That is why when I was asked before, ‘Do you want to move’, I said, ‘Of course, as soon as possible’, because it’s going to be a massive boost for the team. It’s going to be a place where the fans can help the team to achieve more. There is no doubt. I am so happy with Wembley but tomorrow if the new stadium is ready we are going to move to our new house. To play in your own stadium is the best thing that can happen in your life. The moment the new stadium is ready, if it is my decision, my decision is to move quickly. You can feel like yesterday when I saw the highlights that the people at Anfield are desperate to win and they are showing their support to the team. Yesterday Anfield was amazing, every game Liverpool play at Anfield is a party and that sometimes makes a difference.Tottenham will assess Dele Alli ahead of their Premier League game with Wolves. Alli missed Boxing Day’s 5-0 romp over Bournemouth due to a hamstring injury picked up at Everton and will be monitored after training on Friday. Serge Aurier has returned to full training after a groin injury, but Jan Vertonghen, Eric Dier, Victor Wanyama and Mousa Dembele all miss out. Here’s a quick news story on Peter Hill-Wood.And following on from that, some Manchester United team news:Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Anthony Martial remain doubts as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Manchester United prepare to face Bournemouth. The caretaker manager has overseen comprehensive wins against Cardiff and Huddersfield in his first two matches since succeeding Jose Mourinho. Martial scored in the first game but missed the second match through illness, while Lukaku and Sanchez have been unavailable for both so far. “We’ve not had a lot of training since, so we had yesterday off so today’s the first day back,” Solskjaer said. “Romelu, Anthony and Alexis they were light, light (training) yesterday so hopefully they can join part of the training today and let’s see after how they come through. “Marcos (Rojo) and Scott (McTominay), they look like they can take part soon so it’s looking better. (Chris) Smalling’s got a sore foot so I don’t think we’ll see him until the New Year anyway - maybe not before Spurs, probably, around about that time but you never know.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær has LAID DOWN THE LAW to Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku. Well, sort of. Former Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood has died at the age of 82. The club released a statement earlier announcing the news, with no cause of death specified. He was part of what doesn’t really happen in football anymore, taking over from his father Denis, who in turn took over from his father Samuel. We’ll have a fuller appreciation of his contribution to the club later on. Let’s start with ten things you couldshouldmight want toare thinking about ahead of the weekend’s action.Morning all.

Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a4933e43c81912552e7a4bc16d34bb3b699a9c/0_126_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d96d0b65d796bfb7f8baedd95483de80","title":"moment complete calm how guardian readers unwind","story":"We asked you when in the past decade you felt most relaxed. Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b7ad85b8180742ba43f88bcf51ad5764c23fb84/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=2500\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a6355d9699548db4a654fd71b5b271 5000w","title":"best photographs 2018 and stories behind them","story":"From California wildfires and an erupting volcano to a close-up crocodile snap – photographers recall how they captured some of the defining images of the year. Selected by Sarah Gilbert10 December This was the day the supreme court in India repealed section 377 of the Indian penal code, which criminalised homosexuality. It was a momentous occasion. At the celebrations in Bangalore they were tossing activists in the air, bursting confetti and balloons. I didn’t see any hostility or fear. For me this photo depicts relief and immeasurable joy. The activist in the photo, Akkai Padnashali, said this was the happiest moment of her life. I think it speaks volumes of her belief that everyone is equal and deserves to be treated as such in the eyes of the law.22 October I took this picture at a dangerous time in the confrontation between Palestinians and the Israeli army in Gaza City. I certainly endangered my life – I was on the front lines. It was intense. The Israeli army were firing gas and bullets. But I think it was worth the risk. The protesters are fighting back against years of siege and it is startling to see their anger. They are still there, fighting back. For me, this man brandishing the Palestinian flag shows that they still have a sense of freedom.Morning in a cattle camp, South SudanStefanie GlinskiAFPDuring dry season in South Sudan, cattle herders seek lower ground for water and pasture. I took a flight, a helicopter and swam through a river to get to this cattle camp. The animals, cattle herders and families are waking. The herders are on the road and sleep between the animals. Photographs from South Sudan normally capture problems or civil war. This was more positive. The peoples’ relationship with the animals is close. They drink cow’s milk and wash their hands and hair with cow urine. They use cow dung to keep mosquitoes and flies off, burning it to ashes with which they cover their skin. It was incredibly dusty when I got there as overnight fires had just been extinguished. That’s what makes the beautiful colour.Mugshot of Bean, the lost dog, New JerseyCape May Police DeptAP17 July Somebody reported that this dog, Bean, was running loose. We took the mugshot to add a bit of levity and fun to our job – in most cases it’s not appropriate. Eventually someone saw the photo on social media and sent a message to the owners, so they got Bean back. He’s a really famous dog now. We’ve seen news articles from Japan and Germany about him and we had a million views on the Facebook page. We have a national night out against crime when the community gets together and Bean’s owners sent us 150 Bean photos for the kids, which they loved. We didn’t expect the response we got at all. The perception of law enforcement tends to be negative, so any chance we get to show people we are just normal people really helps.Woman in the aftermath of an earthquake, IndonesiaJorge SilvaReuters7 October Central Sulawesi was one of the most affected areas during the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia. Everything was totally upside-down. It looked like the earth was melting. The liquefaction was turning soil to water, so it appeared like the earth was alive, running. The mosque is destroyed and toppling over in the background. This family was searching for their home in the rubble. They didn’t even recognise it – it had moved 150m away from where it normally stood. She’s holding a stuffed rabbit and you wonder: who owned that rabbit? That woman had lost her three children. I asked her to stop and I took the portrait in one frame. Then she turned around and kept walking.15 October I took this on the day Turkish investigators entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to search the building, following the death of Jamal Khashoggi. The only entrance for cars was in front of the main entrance – so the media would part to let them through, then congregate again. The security guard is trying to hold us all back. I got the photo by standing with one foot on a tree stump and the other on a steel barricade so I could see over the crowd. You only have 10 seconds to take that kind of photo, but looking back I was like, wow. It pretty much sums up the story: Khashoggi was a journalist and his death was linked to press freedom. Saudi is a closed country and here there was a security guard blocking the press from taking photos.16 May I was covering the Kilauea volcano eruptions and I’d heard that this golf course had a good viewpoint. I was trying to photograph when someone yelled: “Get out of my way, we’re tryna play here!” It was incredibly incongruous – and surprising to me, how unfazed the golfers were. To people living in Hawaii, these events are a part of life. People are accustomed to the power of nature around them. Often we go ahead with our daily activities amid these incredible things happening alongside us.Stuck in the mud at the Dakar rallyFranck FifeGetty Images13 January I’ve been photographing the Dakar rally since 2013. It’s more than a job, it’s a passion. I cover most of it by helicopter, strapped into my seat with the door open and my feet dangling in mid-air. We were flying over the Bolivian plateau when we saw this very muddy spot with little lakes on either side. Cars were struggling to get through, and we realised it would be even harder for the motorbikes. So we landed nearby and set up. It was completely crazy. While some avoided the mudhole, others were stuck there for 40-45 minutes. Franco Caimi, pictured here, was one of the luckier ones. He almost went over his handlebars, but then fell back into his saddle. We decided we ought to warn them, but some still carried straight on in. Interview by Phil DaoustUS border agents detain a Honduran mother and childJohn MooreGetty Images13 June Trump had recently implemented the policy of child separation when this photo was taken. The families were in darkness after a harrowing journey. They had no idea the policy had changed and they might be separated. They just knew they were escaping something dangerous and moving into an unknown future. Immigration is often discussed in terms of statistics, but the little crying girl is the reality of the zero tolerance policy. Her mother’s documents were being inspected, and when she was asked to set her child down, the little girl burst into tears. Later I discovered they weren’t separated. That was a relief, but others were. You can only imagine the terror.The gunwomen of PennsylvaniaSpencer PlattGetty ImagesThe running of the bulls, Pamplona, SpainPablo Blázquez DomínguezGetty Images7 July The running of the bulls at the San Fermin festival is an integral part of culture in Pamplona. It lasts for nine days and even people who don’t like the bulls go, for the music, dance, food and drink. The picture is taken from the balcony of Carmen, a woman who lives on that street. I knew it was a good spot because Pedro Armestre captured the festival from the same balcony in 2013 and it was a really nice photo. It’s one of the best views of San Fermin you can really see the vibrancy and the atmosphere.Mass start of the Ironman BarcelonaCharlie CrowhurstGetty Images for Ironman20 May I’ve been to the Ironman Barcelona race before and I knew I could get a sunrise-esque photo if the conditions were right. I went down to the beach and tested it. Walk two metres in and you’re already waist-deep in the water. It’s a real steep drop. On the day, I wore trunks, stood in the water with my camera and waited for the start. No one else was in the water. I was so close to them – maybe five metres away. Suddenly they were sprinting into the sea at full-pace, with spray going everywhere. It’s an inidual sport, so this is the only moment you can capture the high energy of everyone together. At the start I was thinking “Just start now!” because the conditions were perfect. With every second the purples and the oranges that give it that hue were fading. Everything came together perfectly.Road destroyed by earthquake in AlaskaMarc LesterAP30 November We are pretty used to eruptions in Alaska, but this was different. We wanted to visibly tell the story of the structural damage that is hard to see. The quake had caused traffic to grind to an absolute halt, so it was impossible to photograph this spot on foot. I knew I’d have to fly. The viewpoint from the plane captured the enormity of the damage. The subtle cracks and splinter patterns in the ice and the lakes around it – it’s so unusual to see it from that perspective. It’s surreal. The earth looked like it was prepared to swallow the surface. The earthquake was ranked as potentially deadly. It’s amazing there were no deaths.California wildfire: ‘Oh my gosh bro, this is crazy’Stuart PalleyZuma Presseyevine9 November I’ve photographed over 100 wildfires, but the California wildfire was one of the most intense. This was a few days in and it was wholesale destruction. For 12 miles there was a line of people evacuating amid a backdrop of this huge, ominous, orange-grey fire. People were crying and screaming, watching their homes burn down, running for their lives. All hell was breaking loose. And then, almost like a movie, this guy rolled past on his skateboard saying: “Oh my gosh bro, this is crazy,” with his phone in his hand filming. That would only happen in Los Angeles. The photo really puts the fire in the context of the location.Sea of plastic waste, Panggang island, IndonesiaLaurent WeylPanos Pictures20 July Panggang is a small island in north Jakarta where there’s not enough land for the inhabitants. They are making space by throwing the plastic waste they have accumulated into the sea. Society has changed a lot there. Food used to be wrapped in leaves it was natural, biodegradable. Now everything’s wrapped in plastic, but there’s not much education about plastic disposal – there are health problems because the community are burning soft plastics and breathing in the air. They just don’t realise it’s a problem. The girl looks so happy because it’s normal for her. I ed in the sea near this island and it was awful. It’s full of litter: furniture, bags, whatever, they just throw it in. This photo shows the worst-case scenario of overusing plastics. That level of consumption is crazy. You could walk on the plastic there.Horses and riders in South DakotaStephanie KeithReuters3 August I covered the Standing Rock pipeline protests and met Ivan Lookinghorse, a tribal leader on the Cheyenne River Indian reservation. A year later he invited me to this 400-mile horse ride from South Dakota to Fort Laramie, which marked the 150th anniversary of the Sioux nation’s treaty rights. I became part of their community on that ride. Without our relationship, I wouldn’t have got the photo – I was part of the action, riding around in the tall grass, doing fun thing like kids do. I wanted to show them having a fun life. That group of kids are so special. The treaty gave them some bare-minimum rights over sustenance, but it’s a bitter pill. The Sioux people used to have so much land and now their community is in crisis. They are living on reservations in the poorest counties in the US.Snapping the crocodile: ‘People ask how I didn’t get eaten’Sean ChinnCaters News26 September I lived on a boat in the mangroves in Cuba for a week before taking this shot. Between some ing we went to an area where they’re familiar with crocodiles. Guides called out “Nino” – and a minute later this crocodile came up to the boat. I was waist deep in the water. I shot this with a dome port, which gives the half-in, half-out, composition. I wanted to show the two worlds together – that we can coexist alongside apex predators. Films portray crocodiles as man-eating monsters, but they’re not. I was scared before taking this photo because I hadn’t been in the water with a crocodile before I mainly photograph sharks. People ask how I didn’t get eaten, but the crocodile was relaxing with its mouth wide open. I was lighting it with two strobe lights and it wasn’t bothered – they’re quite chilled creatures.Hondurans march towards the USGuillermo AriasGetty Images27 October This image of the migrant caravan travelling to the US border was used by Trump as propaganda, to label them as criminals and invaders. But you can see here that they’re just trying to walk. They are in unity, marching over that bridge, next to this beautiful landscape. The danger for photojournalists is that no matter how hard we try to be accurate, others might use our work to push their agenda. People decided to leave Central America in huge numbers because they have no basic safety there. In some ways they were naive, hoping they’d get to the US and Trump would say: “Come in! Let’s come together and we’ll give you visas,” once he saw their pain. On these first steps they were very hopeful, but when they got to the border they realised it was going to be pretty dark for them going forward.12 December I was covering this neo-Nazi rally in Georgia and had heard they were going to have a secret ritual after dark. We all met at this bar, and were told they were planning to set up a big swastika on a cross and burn it. There was a moment when the organiser turned on me because he thought I was there for a leftwing organisation. As the torch was burning and the men were chanting, I got a little nervous – almost high on the adrenalin. It’s a frightening photo because most people, myself included, don’t realise these secret rituals still happen until they see it. I am not Caucasian so I was surprised at how nice the organiser was to me. He thanked me for coming. I don’t know why they let us photograph.7 February This was taken during the release ceremony for child soldiers who had been fighting in South Sudan’s war-torn region of Yambio. The boy was the youngest there. He was nine. He is standing in a line with the other soldiers who are also children, but much older and taller. It’s a powerful image because he’s so young, and what happened to him is so unjust. He’s been around these big guys for way too long, doing things he didn’t want to do. You can see how his innocence has been taken away from him. He was really shy and quiet. We talked about games he liked to play and it struck me that he’s just a little boy who really wants to be home with his siblings and his family.Car submerged in floods, Bucksport, South CarolinaSean RayfordGetty Images26 September I was covering hurricane Florence and it had hit landfall. There was a cemetery on the street and coffins were floating around. I’d never seen that before, and I’ve covered a lot of floods. Then I saw this quaint little old car, submerged in the water. It’s incongruous: this modern invention that still can’t reckon with nature. The photo sums up how powerless humans are to stop mother nature once it gets going. People know these floods are coming each day it creeps up and yet for the most part no one can do anything about it.Daniel Ricciardo celebrates F1 victory in MonacoDan MullanGetty Images27 May This was my first grand prix in Monaco. Red Bull had built this massive station for the media with a swimming pool on top. Daniel Ricciardo had just won his first Monaco grand prix. Everyone was flooding the station, knowing that’s where he would go: he had to fight his way through the crowd to get in. The media were all around the pool, like a natural amphitheatre and then he jumped in. I was opposite Ricciardo on the other side of the pool. It was as much about positioning as the technical skill. If I played it wrong, I could have been on the edge, soaking wet, holding a camera above everyone’s heads, trying to get a good shot and failing miserably.* This article was amended on 27 December 2018.

I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it,” he said.He accused May of a “completely cynical manoeuvre” to “run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea”.Before parliament’s Christmas recess, Corbyn did not join those MPs, including the Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and Conservative Justine Greening, calling for recess to be cancelled or curtailed so the vote could go ahead.And he has continued to resist intense pressure from Labour activists to shift the party’s position towards backing a second Brexit referendum.Corbyn sparked a backlash this month by restating in a  interview that the party’s position was to seek to go back to Brussels and renegotiate a better Brexit deal, rather than try to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Separately, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has seemed more sympathetic to a second referendum than his longtime collaborator, told the Financial Times he did not favour “indicative votes” to unblock the deadlock in parliament.Some members of May’s cabinet, including the education secretary, Damian Hinds, have suggested MPs could be presented with a series of propositions – such as a Norway-style deal and a second referendum – in an attempt to whittle down the options.Downing Street is not keen on the proposal but has not rejected the idea outright, as a way of trying to break the logjam if May’s deal is rejected by MPs next month.However, the idea appears unlikely to win the backing of Labour. The shadow chancellor told the FT: “The idea of indicative votes is just to run the clock down even further towards March 29. People aren’t that gullible. They’ve seen through that.”MPs will return to Westminster braced for a momentous three months and with no clear idea of what will happen if May’s deal is rejected.The Democratic Unionist party is awaiting word from the prime minister about whether she has secured the fresh reassurances on the Irish border its MPs say they need to support the withdrawal agreement.Downing Street hopes if they can be won over, enough Brexit-backing Conservatives might follow to help her win a majority in the Commons but the parliamentary arithmetic looked very bleak before Christmas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c1eb486c4db6a675ab81cda1f55d1a9df1886b/35_84_5158_3094/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5114041fd5bd3ca9a35711c9188c7ee6","title":"late frost gives uk magic mushroom hunters an extra high","story":"Psychedelic fungi may still be in bloom on New Year’s Day due to climate changeAn unnaturally late first frost across the UK means magic mushroom hunters could be in line for a remarkable natural high this year.Psychedelic mushrooms may still be in bloom on New Year’s Day, as the subzero temperatures that would normally have appeared by this time of year are yet to arrive.Owing to the warming climate, the first autumn frost arrives up to a fortnight later across the south-west of England and south Wales than it did 50 years ago, considerably extending the mushroom season – but 2018’s cycle could be unprecedented.“Climate change has had a dramatic effect on the fruiting season,” says Prof Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist. “Every year the start and end of the season is dependent on the weather, and we can see that up until the late 1970s it was largely consistent.“However, on average, the first fruiting date now comes much earlier in the year than previously, while the last fruiting comes later.”She says there used to be about 33 days of autumn fruiting, but now there are more than 70, giving the thousands of people who hunt for magic mushrooms and other fungi across the UK every autumn more time to forage.With this year’s first sustained frost unseasonably late, psychedelic fungi is still being picked from Dartmoor, across the Brecon Beacons and into Yorkshire by amazed mycology enthusiasts.“Magic mushrooms usually begin to sprout in September, but it was so warm this year that they didn’t get going until October,” says an experienced forager. “The first heavy frost spells the season’s end, which usually happens in late November, but this year in Devon the way the forecast looks I’ll still be picking on New Year’s Day.”Dr Patrick Harding, author of the Collins Gem guide Mushrooms, says 2018 has been a very unusual year for fungi thanks to the long dry summer. “Forty years ago, when I first came to Sheffield, snow and frost curtailed the season before the end of November and the happy local band of magic mushroom gatherers would have started hibernating before advent,” he says.“I’ll wait to see if we can still find any to help with the new year celebrations – the long range forecast even for Sheffield has very little talk of frost or snow before 2019.”At different temperatures, fungi grow at different paces. Liberty caps, one of the most prevalent species containing the psychoactive ingredient psilocybin, produce their mushrooms at below 15C in the day and 10C at night – often next to manure – with the first freezing temperatures heralding the end of the season.Magic mushroom use was popularised during the 70s when it emerged as a legal alternative to LSD, but they were banned in 2005. However, more than 200,000 people in the UK used them in 2017-18, an increase of a third on the previous year. According to the 2017 Global Drug Survey, they are the safest “recreational” drug.Recent studies have suggested magic mushrooms have therapeutic benefits and can help treat depression. Despite this, it is a class A drug and picking psychedelic mushrooms is an offence punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, it is not an offence to have them growing on your land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4d362f7ebf460f17f4b8821af87598cd4dbdc1/0_0_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c06932fc469c0dd3cfb0705f1563e3b","title":"vaping is 95 safer than smoking claims public health england","story":"As scepticism rises, PHE says e-cigarettes could help more people quit smokingThe government is launching a new campaign to try to convince the UK’s smokers that vaping is safe and a good way to quit, in a bid to counter the scepticism generated by some scientific studies and media headlines.“It would be tragic if thousands of smokers who could quit with the help of an e-cigarette are being put off due to false fears about safety,” said Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE.“We need to reassure smokers that switching to an e-cigarette would be much less harmful than smoking. This demonstration highlights the devastating harms caused by every cigarette and helps people see that vaping is likely to pose only a fraction of the risk.”PHE says the risks from vaping are tiny compared to smoking. Some studies that have been published focus on the risks without looking at those of cigarettes. A lab study from Birmingham University in August, for instance, claimed that vaping could harm cells in the lungs. While the authors said they did not believe e-cigarettes were more harmful than ordinary cigarettes, they suggested that over 20 or 30 years there might be an effect and urged “cautious scepticism” about the safety of vaping.Dockrell said all the scientists in the field had ambitions to improve health. “We like to think of our scientists as being detached about these things, but in fact the scientists involved in this area on both sides are deeply passionate about it,” he said.Studies about the risks of chemicals in e-cigarettes run prominently in the media. Some were misleading and others were contradictory, said Dockrell. “People don’t know who to believe and they believe the thing that suits them best,” he said. A smoker who finds it hard to quit may not want to believe that e-cigarettes are safe to try.One of the stories that does the rounds is that vaping causes “popcorn lung” – a condition that makes people cough and struggle for breath which can be caused by a chemical used to flavour popcorn that is also found in e-cigarettes. But the chemical, diacetyl, is also found in ordinary cigarettes at levels 100 times higher.Concern about e-cigarettes is high in the United States, where vaping has taken off among school students. Many use a small device called Juul, the size of a USB stick. Anti-tobacco campaigners are alarmed that e-cigarettes will be a “gateway” to smoking, and some studies suggest this could happen.PHE says that although e-cigarette use did rise among young people in England up to 2015, the numbers have flattened off since. Unlike the US, the UK has tight regulations, it says, and a limit on the nicotine level in e-cigarettes – which is higher in Juul in the US than it is in the UK. “There are no studies that show vaping increases tobacco use among young people in the UK,” said Dockrell.“We want to encourage more smokers to try and quit completely with the help of an e-cigarette, or by using other nicotine replacement such as patches or gum, as this will significantly improve their chances of success. If you’re trying to stop smoking, our free online personal quit plan will help you find the support that’s right for you,” said Newton.Dr Lion Shahab, from University College London, who appears in the video, said: “The false belief that vaping is as harmful as smoking could be preventing thousands of smokers from switching to e-cigarettes to help them quit.“I hope this illustrative experiment helps people see the huge damage caused by smoking that could be avoided by switching to an e-cigarette. Research we and others have conducted shows that vaping is much less harmful than smoking and that using e-cigarettes on a long-term basis is relatively safe, similar to using licensed nicotine products, like nicotine patches or gum. Using e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement such as patches or gum will boost your chances of quitting successfully.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1210cca8c5b52dfc552594322607e20da86309/0_0_4281_2568/master/4281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c7e592e5cc31d586155b361b0cce958","title":"guardian footballer of the year 2018 khadija bunny shaw","story":" Footballer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Khadija “Bunny” Shaw is our third winner following Fabio Pisacane in 2016 and Juan Mata in 2017. There is a warmth and gentle magnetism about Khadija “Bunny” Shaw that is immediate and fills the room, a personality as towering as the nearly 6ft frame that pounded in one goal after another during a breathless year of double duty for the Jamaica women’s national team and the University of Tennessee.She has just finished the last of her final exams when we meet on the school’s sprawling Knoxville campus, where the senior communications major is on track to graduate in the spring and become the first member of her family to earn a degree from an American university. For now, a plane ride home and a well-earned break is afoot.Life, in short, is good for the ’s footballer of the year for 2018, a one-time teenage prodigy turned lethal 21-year-old striker who delivered on her long-held promise in powering the Reggae Girlz into their first ever Women’s World Cup and the Lady Volunteers to the best season in their history.The accomplishments on their face are remarkable enough. But the breadth of Shaw’s achievement is nothing short of extraordinary given the unspeakable personal tragedy she has overcome along the way, losing four brothers – three of them to gang-related violence – in a short period of time.Shaw grew up alongside seven brothers and five sisters in Spanish Town, the gritty former Jamaican capital on the western outskirts of Kingston, the youngest child of George, a shoemaker, and Monica, a poultry farmer who raised chickens. She recalls in vivid detail a picture-book upbringing – neighbours playing dominos on the corner, music echoing down the sidewalks, children kicking the ball about in the streets – largely sheltered from the ever-looming threat of gang violence that reached a grim peak during her childhood. Through the good and the bad, Shaw’s parents held the family together.“It was a struggle growing up, to grow up in such an environment and see how they persevered, what motivated them to want to motivate me,” she recalls. “Literally sometimes I don’t know how they did what they did, but they managed to get it done.”A prominent set of front teeth and a prodigious appetite for carrots inspired Shaw’s brother, Kentardo, to coin her leporine nickname, which she loathed at first until she “grew into it”. She made the three-minute walk from the family house to her primary school with her father every day and enjoyed her classes – especially social studies.After school, Shaw would return home and watch her older brothers kick the ball around in the street in front of the house before they headed to a nearby field for practice. Monica forbade Bunny from joining in, wary of her youngest daughter spending too much time on a sport thought to be too rough for girls. Eventually, Shaw coaxed an introductory lesson from Kentardo, who told her she had to start by juggling the ball.“That was one of the hardest things to do, because you got to learn to keep the ball up,” she recalls. “I would kick it up and then let it bounce and I would count, count, count. And I would try to go to two and I would try to go to three. He was like the more technical you are, the better you are playing on a soccer field, because the less technical you are, there are certain things you can’t do on the soccer field.”Over time Shaw’s mother relented and allowed Bunny to play with the boys in front of the house, where her innate speed, touch and creative flair earned her a measure of notoriety. Word spread around the parish and beyond. Then one day Monica received a phone call from Vin Blaine, the Jamaica Football Federation’s director of football, who wanted to invite the precocious seventh-grader to a national team camp.“That’s when my mum was like: ‘OK! You go play! Go to the soccer field!’” Shaw recalls with a laugh. “That’s when I got more involved because at my school, I was the best player. But then when I went to the camp there were players like me.”From there Shaw’s development accelerated and her ascent was rapid. She played in Jamaica’s under-15, under-17 and under-20 teams at the age of 14, coming up alongside present-day teammates Konya Plummer and Deneisha Blackwood. But it was not until the scholarship offers from American universities began pouring in around 11th grade that Shaw viewed football as a career path.After navigating her options with the head coach of Jamaica’s national team, Shaw gave a verbal commitment to play for the University of Florida but, after missing the date of the SAT college entrance exam, spent two years playing in junior college, where she was spotted and recruited by the Tennessee coach, Brian Pensky. The adjustment to American life was tough at times, not least because she has yet to find a place that makes her beloved jerk chicken like the corner spots back home.“You got to just be in the environment and see for itself,” she says. “I knew America was a big place for me in terms of the capacity. And I know it was pretty from what people would say. And I know it’s just way more organised from back home. Sometimes, there are some things that are unexplainable.”Yet as Shaw came of age and flourished on the pitch in the United States, an unfathomable streak of misfortune took hold of her family in Spanish Town. Gang-related gun violence took the lives of three of her brothers. A fourth was taken in a fatal car accident. Then while attending Eastern Florida State College in 2016, Shaw lost two nephews in quick succession: one to a gunshot, the other when he was electrocuted on a football field. The accumulation of grief rocked the tight-knit family and put Bunny’s indefatigable spirit to the test in previously unthinkable ways. Alone in a foreign land, she considered quitting the sport entirely.“I wanted to go home,” Shaw says. “I didn’t want to play soccer. And it was just hard because you lost four and then you come back again and lose two nephews. It’s just like: ‘What more to come? I want to go home because I didn’t get to say goodbye to them and now they’re gone.’ They say you’re not supposed to ask God why, but sometimes I would be like: ‘Why? Why did this happen?’“I would say it definitely got me stronger. And even though it was a rough time, it helped me. You know, in the moment I wouldn’t have thought that. But now, to see what I’ve accomplished, knowing I’ve lost so much, I would say it definitely helped me. But it was rough. I couldn’t focus in school. I was just thinking about it all. And my mum would constantly call me. I would tell my family I want to come home and they’re like: ‘No, you’ve got to stay! You’ve got to make it better for yourself and better for us! So I was like: ‘All right, take a deep breath.’”“But I’ve learned, because it was hard, that you just got to look past it. You know it happens. Everything happens for a reason. It’s what’s happening now, that’s what I’ve got to focus on.”The uncommon blend of physicality, quickness and vision that sets Shaw apart and elevates her teammates has been on full display since her senior international debut in July before World Cup qualifying. She has answered the call with 11 goals in nine appearances, including the opener in the climactic 2-2 draw with Panama that went to a penalty shootout, where the Reggae Girlz punched their historic World Cup ticket.Shaw also finished with 13 goals in 14 appearances for Tennessee as they reached the last eight of the NCAA tournament for the first time, landing in the year-end top 10 of all three national rankings, another first for them. After graduation and next summer’s World Cup, she plans to pursue a professional career either in the United States or Europe. The sky is the limit and these days, after what she has persevered through, there is every reason to smile. But even as her career soars to new heights, family remains the core of her support system – and the lessons passed down from her parents keep her grounded.“Remain humble, stay focused and just do the best you can,” she says. “They’ve been there from day one, even when people said: ‘Oh, soccer is a man’s sport.’ They never said maybe you should change your sport and play netball or volleyball. They’d always be like if that’s your dream, try and see if you can achieve your dream. They’ve been there even when we’ve lost games or didn’t make it to where we wanted to. They’d say OK, the next one. You’ll get it on the next one. So with them, having them behind me, pushing me, encouraging me, motivating me, that’s all I need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792586568501a2434f2d57511a234f836d14dd42/0_76_4404_2643/master/4404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69437ea690067da0460015c93452a429","title":"talking horses punters pining for gold cup favourite presenting percy leopardstown horse racing tips","story":"The story circulating in Ireland is that publicity-shy trainer Pat Kelly is focusing all his attention on the Cheltenham Festival with the country’s top chaserPresenting Percy, the favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, had been billed as the main attraction in Friday’s Grade One Savills Chase at Leopardstown, but Pat Kelly’s stable star failed to make it past the final declaration stage on Thursday due to concerns that the good ground is a little quicker than he would like.This is the second time in a month that Presenting Percy, the impressive winner of the RSA Chase last season, has failed to appear as planned, following a late swerve around the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown and punters sitting on ante-post tickets for Cheltenham will be starting to get a little anxious if his seasonal reappearance is delayed much longer.The latest story circulating here in Ireland, if it is any reassurance, is that Kelly is simply focusing all his attention on the Festival and will now either give his chaser two runs before Cheltenham, the second of which would be the Red Mills Chase at Gowran Park in mid-February, or just one, in the Irish Gold Cup on the first weekend in February. We can only wait and hope.In Presenting Percy’s absence, there is at least a really competitive depth to the feature race of the Christmas meeting, as Road To Respect faces 11 opponents as he attempts to repeat of last year’s success, including Gordon Elliott’s excellent mare Shattered Love, who took the JLT Novice Chase at last season’s Festival, and Willie Mullins’s Bellshill. The third-favourite was last seen winning the Grade One feature at the Punchestown Festival, a few weeks after he caused all manner of disturbance in the closing stages of the Irish Grand National.Other previous Grade One winners in the field include Noel Meade’s Disko, who returns from injury here after more than a year on the sidelines, and Joseph O’Brien’s Edwulf, who is the 40-1 outsider of the field less than a year after his win in the Irish Gold Cup.It promises to be an excellent race, and one in which Road To Respect looks short enough at 9-4. Shattered Love (3.00) has not added to her Cheltenham success in four subsequent starts but her last two runs were over shorter trips and the step back up to three miles, over which she won a Grade One novice here 12 months ago, could make all the difference.Faugheen, the former Champion Hurdle winner, steps back up to three miles – the trip over which he took a Grade One at Punchestown in April – for the Christmas Hurdle earlier on the card. He will have his hands full taking on Gordon Elliott’s Apple’s Jade, however, and the mare is odds-on to take the ninth Grade One of her career.On the domestic cards, Reverse The Charge (2.05) is doing little wrong at present and could offer a bit of value against Ballasalla in the novice handicap chase at Catterick, while Notonebuttwo (2.40) should also go well at a price on the same card. Copper West (1.55) and Haafapiece (3.05) are the picks at Leicester’s meeting while Tan (2.20) has a fair chance on the Flat card at Lingfield Park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d7193a18db99267e3608aba479540aa90d0ddc/0_147_3235_1942/master/3235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0788d8210a615221c0b80b216b3a66e5","title":"dirty dancing the messiest stage shows in pictures","story":"As Olivier de Sagazan uses clay to turn himself into a human sculpture at London’s mime festival, we look at the dancers who have performed on stages filled with soil, flowers, dust and water"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd4b35d7c1d1a310253af896c74f89b0c5b4361/0_140_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2789c5a1ee1dfdd7bed0a9193598b7c1","title":"black mirrors bandersnatch charlie brookers meta masterpiece","story":"The interactive episode has breathed new life into the anthology show, with a choose-your-own-adventure element that puts viewers in the driving seatCharlie Brooker has ruined television. The TV landscape is already so absurdly cluttered that people rarely watch the same shows as each other any more. But now there’s an interactive Black Mirror, Bandersnatch, that unfolds according to the viewer’s wishes. You know what this means? It means that we aren’t even watching the same episode as each other, even when we’re literally watching the same episode as each other. Thanks a lot.Interactive narratives aren’t exactly new. John Hurt made an interactive erotic thriller called Tender Loving Care almost 20 years ago, and more recently Netflix experimented with an interactive Puss In Boots episode, but there’s something fitting about Black Mirror being the show that shoves the form into the mainstream.Because nobody can quite agree on Black Mirror, can they? Where some see bleak social commentary, others just see nastiness for the sake of it. And since the anthology format allows for a range of tones, everyone gets to have their favourite episode style you might enjoy a warm-hearted San Junipero affair or, if you’re an insane psychopath, you might prefer something like Crocodile.But Bandersnatch has the potential to solve everything. By operating around a branching narrative, allowing viewers to choose the direction of the story at intermittent waypoints, you can theoretically create your ideal Black Mirror. Choose the most disastrous option at every turn and you’ll theoretically end up with the grimmest, most nihilistic Black Mirror ever but let a little sunshine in now and again and you might miraculously end up with something that doesn’t make you want to drown yourself in a bath.Fortunately, it works. Bandersnatch is a masterpiece of sophistication. From a user viewpoint, it is seamless. When options present themselves (you chose with a click of your mouse), there’s no lag or buffering to endure. If you don’t make a choice, Netflix makes it for you. As such, it is identical to watching a film. As an experience, it’s remarkable.Even more remarkable, though, is the ambition of storytelling on display. Very loosely based on a real-life unreleased game also called Bandersnatch (completists might like to watch the BBC documentary about that game’s failure), it’s essentially the story of one man’s slow unravelling. In the Black Mirror universe, Bandersnatch is the name of a Choose Your Own Adventure book so complex that it drove its author to murder. When a 21-year-old named Stefan chooses to adapt the book into a video game, he also loses his grasp of reality.But the genius of Bandersnatch is that it’s ultimately a critique of interactivity. During the film, Stefan doesn’t just start to question his free will when he feels that someone else (you) is making his decisions for him, but he ultimately rubs up against the constraints of the binary choices that he’s presented with. In the space of 90 minutes, Brooker has popularised a new form of storytelling, then identified its tropes and dismantled them one by one. In this regard, Bandersnatch is legitimately breathtaking.It’s also incredibly funny at times. Without spoiling too much, at one point you’ll be given the choice to click on a very familiar logo, which sends the whole film down a wormhole of genuine, incredible, self-referential battiness. The moment is a cul-de-sac, so it has no real bearing on the end of the story, but after several years of wallowing in increasingly dour parables, it’s refreshing to see Brooker indulge in his sillier side.There are apparently five endings to Bandersnatch, to which I think I’ve seen three or four. One ending is bleak. One is hilarious. One is abrupt and creepy. You can speed through the episode in less than 40 minutes, or splash around and take closer to two hours. By the time I’d finished exploring I was left with a profound feeling of satisfaction, as if Black Mirror had prodded me towards the ending it felt was best. Which makes sense because, after all, free will is an illusion.So that’s what happens in Bandersnatch. Or at least that’s what happens in the version of Bandersnatch that I experienced. Yours might be completely different. Which makes this whole review redundant, really. Charlie Brooker has ruined television criticism, too.• Bandersnatch is available on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7df5a4560ffba78ef4da159032c284d61d71913/0_170_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79c27ee3c8dab7c01f13882351694f82","title":"new york sky bright blue lights explosion astoria power plant queens","story":"Police investigating transformer explosion at Con Edison plant in the Astoria neighbourhoodA huge explosion at a New York power plant has turned the sky above parts of the city a bright blue-green.Many Manhattanites were stunned when the sky over parts of Queens started to glow a bright neon blue shortly after 9pm on Thursday night.Scores posted footage of the glowing skyline to social media, saying the sky was “bright as day”. Footage of the scene showed the sky flickering a bright blue-green for several minutes.The strange sight was caused by an explosion at the Con Edison power plant in Queens, with the New York Police Department officially confirming on Twitter that the cause of the remarkable sight was the explosion and there was “no evidence of extraterrestrial activity”.“There was a brief electrical fire at our substation in Astoria which involved some electrical transformers and caused a transmission dip in the area. We’re currently investigating the cause of the incident,” Con Edison tweeted.Police advised people to avoid the area and later confirmed no one had been injured as a result of the incident.The New York fire department confirmed they had received multiple reports of explosions in the Long Island City and Astoria area, to which they had responded. At 10:15pm they reported the incident was under control and there were no reported injuries and no fire.Residents left their homes as the black sky turned neon blue, with several telling the  they thought they were witnessing an alien invasion.Lucas Espinoza, a Queens resident, said: “I was eating dinner in my living room and out of nowhere the lights and TV started flickering and then the whole sky – which was pitch black a moment earlier – lit up with a pulsating greenish blue light. I ran up to my rooftop and grabbed the video while it lasted for a few minutes.”George Delis, who lives down the road from the plant, told the : “A little while ago, the TV went out and I see this massive bright light. It was so bright I thought it was a UFO. I was so excited I grabbed my phone and saw right down the block at Con Edison, a transformer was on fire. It was so bright, much brighter than the sun ... I’ve been living here for 37 years and I’ve never seen this happen before.”The incident cause several streets to lose power and also caused a blackout at LaGuardia Airport.The mayor of New York Bill de Blasio confirmed the extraordinary light was “caused by electrical surge at substation”, but said there were no current fire and no injuries. He said the MTA had power, but there were delays on the 7 train and that power was “coming back on” at LaGuardia, but travellers should expect delays.The airport urged people to check their flight status with their carrier, saying “Many flights are departing, some are not”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeffe04e5b8d4ddc62d16038eefe556dd4ef9098/536_640_5520_3311/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9948475ab1932f401acd38416ecdd2e","title":"scooters california oakland los angeles bird lime","story":"Environmentalists raise concern as Lime and Bird vehicles pile up in California lakeIt was a sight as common at Oakland’s Lake Merritt as the ducks paddling on the water or the seagulls fighting over scraps: a bright green motorized Lime scooter was submerged just feet off the murky shore.“Aw man, the Lime person just came by this morning,” James Robinson, executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, said when he found out about the latest scooter deposit.It was just one of nearly 100 Lime and Bird scooters that have been dumped in the lake since late September, Robinson said. In October alone, he said, his volunteers counted 60.This year may go down in the history books as the year of the scooter: the year all different brands and colors began appearing along sidewalks around the world, seemingly out of nowhere.To those who hate them, they’re like an invasion from a dystopian robot future. To their fans, they’re the future of urban transport: green, high tech and fun.What is undeniable is that the rollout could hardly be described as smooth, with vigilantes, decrying what they describe as typical tech industry hubris of companies profiting off of public spaces, expressing their displeasure through vandalism.Some have defaced the vehicles with profane stickers and feces. Others have tossed them into trash cans and trees.And then, of course, there’s the dumping in waterways. A website tracking scooters tossed in the Willamette river counted 17 in August alone. San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental watchdog group, has recorded at least two scooters that have ended up in the San Francisco Bay since May. The organization has since taken up the cause against the dumping in Lake Merritt, near its offices.“We’ve just been so frustrated,” said the Baykeeper executive director, Sejal Choksi-Chugh. “They’re just not taking this seriously.”Meanwhile, few scooter companies will say for sure how many scooters have been vandalized, stolen, or damaged in the past year – or even how many scooters they’ve launched worldwide. Scoot Networks told the Wall Street Journal that more than 200 of the 650 scooters in San Francisco had been stolen or irreparably destroyed within two weeks of their launch, but Lime did not respond to questions on this particular topic. A Skip spokesperson says the company does not disclose numbers when it comes to theft but that Skip has seen an overall decrease.Bird issued a statement: “Vandalism of all types of property is a problem that should not be tolerated by communities or local law enforcement.”“We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” a Bird spokesperson said. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior. Bird encourages people in communities to report incidents of vandalism to Birds, and irresponsible behavior on Birds, to local authorities and to the company. We investigate all reports directed to Bird and take appropriate measures, including removing people from the Bird platform.”But through social media, the documentation of the destruction has been vast. A number of accounts exist on Instagram dedicated to posting videos and photos of all sorts of scooter vandalism.Bird Graveyard, an account run by three friends in west Los Angeles, has more than 66,000 followers and receives anywhere from 50 to 100 submissions of scooter vandalism a day via direct message, from all around the world.The first post, on 23 June, shows a pile of Bird scooters, one visibly broken. From there, the posts steadily escalate with videos of people throwing scooters off of buildings, scooters on fire, scooters that had been run over by a car, and dogs defecating on scooters.The three men who run the account have never disclosed their names because of the nature of the material, but one who spoke to the said they were shining a light on a problem.“At the beginning, it was just a joke, to bring attention to it,” he said. “But we obviously feel a very certain way about it.”He said while he could appreciate the premise behind the scooters – an eco-friendly urban transportation alternative – he was put off by how the companies went about introducing the idea. In a way, the dockless nature of these scooters that these companies celebrate – the freedom to pick up and leave them wherever – can give the impression that the companies don’t care, whether it be about their product or the cities where it appears.“They just started popping up one day and nobody really asked for it,” the person behind Bird Graveyard said. “We weren’t really told it was going to happen. And this has happened everywhere.”The account was suspended once, he said, and it has had posts taken down – one video from Nashville of a car running a red light to run over a scooter was removed because Instagram told Bird Graveyard that it promoted violence. But the team say they are not worried about legal repercussions because they are not committing the vandalism: “We identify with the anger and how it’s being expressed, but we’re in our 30s almost,” he said. “If I was 18, hell yeah. I’d be out there scratching scooters because I wouldn’t know any better.”Their hope, they say, is that the vandalism will push a conversation and force the companies to consider their behavior when it comes to rolling out these scooters in different cities.Some companies have already done just that, especially following enforcement in some of the flagship cities. San Francisco, one of the first battlegrounds for the scooter war of 2018, impounded 503 scooters in the first incursion in the spring – 208 from Lime, 193 from Bird, and 102 from Spin, said Rachel Gordon, a spokeswoman for the city’s department of public works.The city returned the scooters to their respective companies after they paid their fees, Gordon said – Lime paid $15,784.50, Bird $15,547.17, and Spin $14,189.06.San Francisco has since launched a pilot scooter program, granting permits to Scoot and Skip in October. In the first six months, each company will be allowed a maximum of 625 scooters, with the potential to increase in the following six months to a cap of 2,500.“Skip’s strategy is to work closely with cities to be the best regulatory brand and leverage our co-founders’ experience to build the best scooters in the market,” said the company’s chief marketing officer, Julie Supan. “We only enter cities with local support.”While companies will work with local law enforcement when it comes to property damage and vandalism of their scooters, few work with community groups in seeking measures to curb environmental damage.According to Robinson, the executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, only Lime is actively working with his organization, sending a representative to weekly cleanups to better understand the lake and how to retrieve the scooters. Robinson and his volunteers have been instructed by both Lime and Bird not to touch the scooters, which is frustrating, because company representatives don’t always end up locating the scooters in a timely manner.Lime has agreed to make the area around the lake a no-parking zone for its scooters, but at least two were still parked along the perimeter one recent day – and dozens more were located feet away.Robinson said he believed the solution was for the scooters to get some sort of locking and docking mechanism, like the Ford rental bicycles in the region. When the bicycle program first launched, he said, a few ended up in the lake, but the dumping stopped once permanent docking stations were put in place.“We have to, at some point, put the environment above profits,” Robinson said. “The community cares about the lake and it’s disheartening for them to come out week after week and see these products out in the lake and not harbor some kind of bad feelings toward these companies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1779470ac020a5def763c86f7c3363d76b6f1568/97_172_901_540/master/901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a36d92a6393d829945c856c43c0621","title":"how monkey christ brought new life to a quiet spanish town","story":"Cecilia Giménez is proud of her amateur restoration, which has bolstered tourism to Borja and helped fund a care homeTangible and competitively priced proof of one of the Lord’s more mysterious recent manoeuvres can be found in a church nestled in the foothills of the Sierra de Moncayo in north-eastern Spain.A familiar face, now known to the world as Monkey Christ, greets visitors to the Santuario de Misericordia, its blurred and startled features staring down from bottles, thimbles, bookmarks, teddy bears, pens, mugs, T-shirts, mousepads, badges, fridge magnets and keyrings.For centuries, the nearby town of Borja was best known for its wines and splendid 16th-century town hall. All that changed six years ago when a simple act of devotion was transmogrified into an object of ridicule, a meme and, eventually, a tourist attraction.In the summer of 2012, a devout parishioner, Cecilia Giménez, noticed that an already flaking and faded painting on the church’s wall was under threat from a leak.Giménez, then 81, decided that if she did not act, the face of Christ that the artist Elías García Martínez had painted almost a century earlier would disappear for ever.Pained at the idea of its loss – and keen to conserve the interior of the church in which she had been married – Giménez began work, applying thick blocks of colour on which she planned to retrace the ine countenance.Had she been able to finish the job, things might have turned out differently. But Giménez had to leave town on a trip and her incomplete efforts soon came to the attention of the local historical association, which indignantly posted before-and-after pictures of the painting.From there, the story and images went viral.Before long, García Martínez’s work had ceased to be known as Ecce Homo and, as Monkey Christ or Potato Jesus, has become an irresistible visual shorthand for anything tending towards the disastrous.The townsfolk were up in arms, the media descended and Giménez lost 17kg through stress, worry and the thought that she had made a laughing stock out of Christ’s suffering face.Then two things happened: the anger in Borja subsided when people found out who had undertaken the restoration. And the tourists began arriving.“As soon as people knew that it was Cecilia who had done it, everything changed,” says the mayor, Eduardo Arilla. “And this has become a social phenomenon and a pop art icon.”Between August and December 2012, 45,824 people visited the sanctuary. The numbers may have dropped off since then, but Borja still receives 16,000 visitors a year – more than four times the number who came before Giménez picked up her brushes.Not only has the picture’s fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers, it also helps fund places at Borja’s care home for the elderly, a haven for those who would not otherwise be able to afford to live there.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theArilla is careful not to condone the actions that put Borja on the map – and to point out that there is more to the town than just the Ecce Homo – but he welcomes the interest, the tourists and their euros.“It was a media phenomenon, but it’s also been a social phenomenon when it comes to helping people,” he says. “If it hadn’t happened, maybe Borja would have become famous for something else, like its wine. But we wouldn’t be as well known as we are now.”The media phenomenon has not been limited to Borja. In June this year, the overenthusiastic restoration of a 500-year-old statue of St George in a church in Estella, Navarre, elicited comparisons with Tintin, while the treatment meted out to a group of 15th-century wooden statues in Asturias left a professional restorer torn between tears and laughter.Estella’s mayor, Koldo Leoz, says the town has seen an increase in visitor numbers but adds that it predates the St George incident and is down to a concerted effort to restore the old Jewish quarter and attract pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago.Estella, he says, has no plans to capitalise on the botched restoration. “We don’t want to attract visitors because of the poor treatment of our heritage,” he says. “We haven’t publicised it and nor will we.”Ana Galán Pérez, the chair of Spain’s Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators (Acre), argues that such cases show that the country needs to do more to protect the myriad and often forgotten treasures of its past.“We seem to be rather indifferent when it comes to the heritage around us,” she says.“There’s still a long way to go and that’s why we need to educate society and public bodies so that they understand that every time someone without the right qualifications tries to restore a work, they run the risk of damaging or even destroying it.”Galán and others also dispute the notion that Spain is more prone to dodgy conservation than other countries.“When we talk to our colleagues from other European countries, they tell us that these things are happening but that they’re not picked up by the press.”Román Fernández-Baca Casares, director-general of fine arts at Spain’s culture ministry, describes the unfortunate restorations as “isolated cases” and says that almost all the country’s regional governments adhere to strict conservation rules.Giménez has come to terms with both her actions and the fame they have brought her and her town.As the mother of two disabled children, she is used to looking past the surface. When she looks at the Ecce Homo today, she sees “a handsome face a face that I love”.She also insists that she would do the same thing again. “It was done with good intentions and despite what happened, it’s been a good thing for Borja,” she says. “People from all over the world are visiting the sanctuary now. That’s the best medicine. I used to cry a lot over all this but I don’t cry any more because I can see how much I’m loved.”But Giménez is aware that things could have ended less happily.What advice does she have for other amateur restorers? “Don’t do it. It turned out well in the end here, but it doesn’t always end well in Spain - and you’ll find yourself in the papers.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

At time of writing the Rapseys were on the Queen Charlotte section of the trail at the northern tip of the South Island, after taking the ferry from Wellington to Picton on 21 December. The Rapseys are aiming to reach Bluff in March 2019.Jorinde said she and her husband rented out their Dunedin home to finance the trip, and they’d felt confident embarking on the adventure after two short family hikes in Fiordland in the lower South Island earlier in 2018.Both children are home-schooled in Dunedin and have been able to keep up with their studies on the walk. “We’ve been doing a lot of maths problems for fun to work out how much of the track is left, how far we’ve come, and how much further we’ve got to go each day. It’s amazing the questions we get,” Jorinde said.The Te Araroa trail s 3,000km along the spine of New Zealand and opened in 2011 after more than 30 years of planning. It passes through wilderness areas and alpine environments as well as cities, towns and major transport routes.The Te Araroa Trust chief executive, Mark Weatherall, said before the Rapley family, the youngest person to walk the trail had been an 11-year-old. “If these guys can do it then so many other Kiwis can do it too,” Weatherall said.This summer more than 1,000 people are walking the entire length of the trail and hundreds of thousands of people walk sections of it each year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/531ec54dfec1982da6a3941fad8ac46c35d88ceb/0_288_2190_1314/master/2190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ba681e886cf331af8392fb5902d6343","title":"newly declassified files show thatchers gloom over irish border","story":"Dublin’s National Archives receives document of heated 1988 exchange with taoiseach Margaret Thatcher admitted she was sending young boys “to their deaths” as she descended into despondency over what to do about the border in Ireland during one of the darkest periods of her premiership, newly-declassified files in Dublin reveal.During an “unusually tense” tête-à-tête with the then Irish taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, on the margins of a European council meeting in June 1988, Thatcher told him: “I do not know what to do about the border.”Northern Ireland was trembling on the precipice of full-scale civil war after a terrifying and inextricably linked cycle of violence starting with the SAS killing of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar.A loyalist grenade and gun attack on the IRA funerals at Milltown cemetery in Belfast claimed another three lives, and was followed days later by the killing of two British army corporals, dragged from their car, beaten and shot dead, after driving into the funeral procession of one of the Milltown victims.“Those two corporals were among the worst things in my life,” Thatcher told the taoiseach. “The savagery was unbelievable.”She said any move towards a united Ireland at the time would spark “the worst civil war in history”. “And it would spread to the mainland,” she added.During an hour and a quarter of heated exchanges in the British delegation rooms at a trade centre in Hanover, Germany, she said she did not want Irish people in Britain.“Your people come over to us. I wish they wouldn’t,” she said. “They come looking for housing and services. It’s the same in Northern Ireland. If there was a vote tomorrow they would vote to stay with us. They have better conditions in Northern Ireland and in England.”Several times she pleaded with Haughey – who vigorously defended himself against suggestions he was soft on violence – for more pre-emptive intelligence against the IRA and better training for the Irish police, the Garda Síochána.“If we don’t defeat the IRA, I don’t know what I’m going to do,” she said. “We can’t have the border open as it is now.“In recent times my feelings have run far higher than ever before in my life. I am not a natural hater, they are using the border to carry on an effective campaign.”Several times during the meeting, she came back to the border as central to her despair, saying the IRA were using it to move bombs over from the Republic or to flee from security forces in Northern Ireland.“I can’t seal the border,” she said. “There is no way we can patrol the 500 miles … Everywhere there is an open border.”Thatcher said the area contained the “biggest concentration of terrorists in the world” and “despite technological and other surveillance we lose them”.“And so yes,” she added, “I must send more young boys over to their deaths. I ask myself, am I entitled to do it? There is a borderline there but it is not an effective border.”During the extraordinary exchanges, just released into the National Archives in Dublin, Thatcher said she was “not winning the battle with the IRA” that sending in troops had been “useless” and she had “lost” unionists in Northern Ireland.“So I have failed …,” she said. “I have to deal with guns, bombs, beating people to death with sticks and many other barbaric acts.”She added: “I go berserk sometimes” when asked about the role of the police in Northern Ireland. Ultimately, she said, she had one objective: “That is to beat the IRA.”Haughey said he was “sorry you are so despondent about things”, to which she fired back: “I would not be despondent if I got pre-emptive intelligence.”The taoiseach insisted he held the “deepest personal conviction” against violence, which he blamed for “souring and disrupting and bedevilling” relations between Britain and Ireland.“And I see those responsible for it as being a greater danger to the Irish state than to you,” he added.Haughey told her she “must accept our total and complete commitment in this respect” and the British had to cease coming back with “counterproductive” suggestions which risked political backlash in Ireland.“Things happen now – horrible things – which perhaps could or could not have been prevented,” he said.“When they do, your people often blame us for lack of cooperation. I do not know if you are getting the best assessment of things on the ground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d0a7731760d5c6175d0cbf3b4f8157568108286/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f619ae5cdfd875010819670d639d9a5e","title":"syrian kurdish militia manbij turkey","story":"Kurdish appeal for help follows Trump’s surprise decision to pull US military out of SyriaSyria’s military has arrived at the frontline of the flashpoint town of Manbij, as Kurdish fighters appealed to Damascus for help in the face of the imminent threat of attack by Turkey.It was not immediately clear whether US personnel, who have been patrolling Manbij and the tense frontline between it and adjacent towns where Turkey-backed fighters are based, were still present. The US-led coalition against Isis did not respond to a request for comment.“We invite the Syrian government forces … to assert control over the areas our forces have withdrawn from, in particularly Manbij, and to protect these areas against a Turkish invasion,” a statement from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) said.The Syrian army had already mobilised before the public Kurdish invitation. It said on Friday morning that units had entered the town on the western bank of the Euphrates.The volte-face by the Kurds, six years after they broke from Damascus, comes after Donald Trump’s surprise decision earlier this month to withdraw the 2,000 US troops stationed in Kurdish-held Syria, known locally as Rojava, which acted as a buffer between Turkey and Syria’s Kurds.Kurdish forces have been the US’s most important ground partner in the fight against Islamic State, but Ankara views them as a terrorist threat and extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within its own borders.A monitor and several local sources said troops had massed on the edges of the town and that the Syrian government flag had been raised above official buildings for the first time in years.The Syrian army said in a statement it would guarantee “full security for all Syrian citizens and others present in the area”.Russia, the main ally of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, said the development was positive. Moscow seeks to restore Assad’s control over the whole country.The YPG seized Manbij from Isis in 2016, and the town on Syria’s northern border has since become the frontline between the Kurds and Turkey.The US agreed to facilitate the removal of YPG fighters from the town as part of efforts to appease Turkey, its Nato ally, earlier this year, but perceived stalling on the matter infuriated the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In recent months Erdoğan has said repeatedly that his forces would deal with threats to Turkey’s safety themselves.The YPG says its fighters recently withdrew from Manbij to fight the remnants of Isis in the east of the country.Speaking after Friday prayers in Istanbul, the Turkish leader dismissed the Syrian army’s entry into Manbij as a “psychological move”.Turkish officials are due to arrive in Moscow on Saturday for talks over Syria’s future after the US withdrawal.

Typical day pupil fees now range from €3,500-€7,000.Fees for Irish private schools are highly competitive compared with the UK, where charges are typically several times higher.This is due partly to the fact that the salaries of most teachers in Irish private schools are paid for out of the public purse at a cost estimated to be about €90 million.These State subsidies were reduced during austerity-era cost-cutting which saw fee-paying schools given a worse pupil-teacher ratio (23:1) compared with schools in the free scheme (19:1).This was on the basis that private schools could use their own resources to hire additional subject teachers or ancillary staff.A report commissioned by the then minister for education Ruairí Quinn into the income of private schools, published in 2013, estimated that they had more than €80 million extra a year to invest in additional support and facilities for their pupils thanks to the income from fees.While there have been calls from some Opposition parties for State funding of teachers’ salaries in private schools to cease, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education estimated this would end up costing the taxpayer at least €23 million.This would be as a result of some private schools opting to enter the free scheme and becoming entitled to State capitation grants and better pupil-teacher ratios."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Death of Dolores O\u0026rsquoRiordan, Belfast trial the Ann Lovette story also in Top 50 listGarda road safety camera monitor 101,900 vehicles across State on ThursdayJudith Coughlan died after falling from a footbridge at Alicante-Elche airportFormer president defends visit after she was described as \u0026lsquowilling pawn\u0026rsquo in UAE PR battleThe funding supports Gaeltacht School Recognition scheme to protect Irish languageLiving donors gave kidneys to 37 patients last year picks of the year: From the Beast from the East to the summer heatwaveTaoiseach complained of PM\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoconstant bickering\u0026rsquo after Fr Patrick Ryan arrestState papers released under 30-year rule recall 12 months of violence in Northern IrelandTaoiseach says \u0026lsquovulture funds\u0026rsquo are more effective at writing down debts than banksThe festive season can be a difficult time for the 5,997 people living in direct provisionSome support-grade staff underpaid by up to \u0026euro6,000 a year, union claimsOne-third of groups examined \u0026lsquoare threatened or near-threatened with dying out\u0026rsquoFormer British attorney general was prepared \u0026lsquoto send the police into 10 Downing Street\u0026rsquo over alleged cover-upHow a former taoiseach\u0026rsquos efforts to save the Dublin cafe chain led to a row with a ministerCivil servant urged NIO colleague to administer more \u0026lsquohumane treatment\u0026rsquoUK state papers: Senior diplomat feared ex-taoiseach could damage British interestsHSE letter to State hospital groups highlights lack of abortion servicesFee-paying schools report growing interest from Spanish and German families"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742974.1546003189!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"motorcyclist speeding at 198km h among 476 caught yesterday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile photograph of  speed camera van.

Ms Cox added that her husband was speaking more words and was “trying very hard to sing along to familiar songs”. “These are encouraging and proud steps for us all,” she said.Mr Cox (53) from Co Meath suffered serious head injuries following an attack before last April’s Champions League match between Liverpool and Roma. Mr Cox, who worked as sales director of Dundalk-based company Precision Cables, is a life-long Liverpool FC supporter and used the match as an opportunity to also meet up with his brother who lives in the UK.He is currently undergoing treatement for his injuries in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.The family spent the Christmas holiday sharing social media posts, press clippings, videos, letters and signed jerseys with Mr Cox to “try and relay to him the public goodwill and support there has been for him over the eight months since his attack”. “This time last year we were an ordinary family looking forward to another New Year and what that would bring.” wrote Ms Cox. “Seán or I never dreamt that twelve months on, there would be websites or media interviews or fundraising events all brought about by what happened after Seán was attacked in Liverpool on 24th April.”Ms Cox expressed particular thanks to those who had donated to the Support Seán campaign which has raised €1.1 million to date. “People whom we have never met have been there for us in so many, many ways, alongside our family, friends and local community. While we have a battle ahead again in 2019, our burden is lightened by this love and support for Seán.”"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Taoiseach complained of PM\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoconstant bickering\u0026rsquo after Fr Patrick Ryan arrestHow a former taoiseach\u0026rsquos efforts to save the Dublin cafe chain led to a row with a ministerCivil servant urged NIO colleague to administer more \u0026lsquohumane treatment\u0026rsquoUK state papers: Senior diplomat feared ex-taoiseach could damage British interestsIn letter to Bill Clinton, John Major said he could not determine if IRA military action had stoppedBritish felt move was \u0026lsquothe finest platform ever granted to the IRA to justify terrorism\u0026rsquoUK state papers: All 29 people on board \u0026ndash 25 intelligence personnel \u0026ndash were travelling to a security conferenceState Papers show Fianna F\u0026aacuteil government had misgivings about inquest\u0026rsquos limited mandateState papers show the taoiseach and the British PM \u0027at loggerheads\u0027 over the IRAFormer taoiseach offered to \u0026lsquorun a course for British diplomats\u0026rsquo on how to handle Irish AmericansUK government adviser wrote internet users will be \u0026lsquogrowing group of opinion-formers\u0026rsquoMargaret Thatcher said others acted out \u0026lsquothe death scene from Richard III\u0026rsquo when tackledState Papers 1988: Meetings were facilitated by Fr John Murphy, chaplain in Maze PrisonState Papers 1988: Michael Havers said he \u0026lsquocannot explain\u0026rsquo the outburst after operationState Papers 1988: British PM complained to taoiseach about force\u0026rsquos lack of professionalism-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"most","story":"Babies in cages were no \u0026lsquomistake\u0026rsquo by Trump but test-marketing for barbarismReview: Cinema\u0026rsquos dullest couple adjust to married life in this tedious instalmentExit poll result suggests huge majority of younger people voted YesPolice say they are treating death of singer at London hotel as \u0026lsquounexplained\u0026rsquoAccused Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison not guilty on all countsAnn Lovett died in 1984 after giving birth at a grotto in Granard, Co Longford \u0026ndash a tragedy that continues to resonate.

Photograph: Tom Honan PA Wire The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has defended so-called vulture funds, stating that they are more effective at writing down debts than banks which “extend and pretend” rather than reaching settlements with homeowners.Mr Varadkar also said that homeowners whose mortgages were sold off to such funds would be “no worse off” than those whose loans were owned by the banks.The Taoiseach said he disagreed with the use of the term “vulture fund” and criticised the practices of our own banks. “I’m always reluctant to use the term vulture funds because it is a political term. What we’re talking about here is investment banks, investment funds, finance houses, there are lots of different things and lots of different financial entities there and the term is used, vulture funds.“But you’ll know from the numbers that they’re often better at write-downs of loans than our own banks.“Our own banks tend to ‘extend and pretend’ rather than coming to settlements with people.“Increasingly they’re covered by the same regulations and the same consumer protections as the banks,” he said.Fine Gael is supporting legislation which is being brought forward by the Fianna Fáil finance spokesman, Michael McGrath, to regulate the funds for the first time.“So, what we’re working on is enacting legislation that Michael McGrath has brought forward, which is to make sure that so-called vulture funds are being regulated,” Mr Varadkar said.He said the Government was committing that people who made an effort to pay their bills even when the loan had been acquired by a “vulture fund” or credit servicing firm would have the same protections as other consumers.“We support that and we are going to make sure that anyone who has a mortgage, who is repaying their mortgage, making a reasonable effort to pay it, continues to have the exact same protections, the exact same consumer protections as they would if the loan was still owned by the banks.“That’s our commitment to make sure that people who pay their mortgages, pay their bills, are no worse off as a result and have the exact same protections,” he said.His comments come after controversy over Permanent TSB entering into an agreement with Pepper Finance Corporation last month that will see a portfolio of non-performing mortgages removed from the bank’s balance sheet. The agreement will see more than 6,000 loans moved to a special purpose vehicle which will be financed on the bond markets. The company has pledged to deal with the PTSB customers “sympathetically”.Mr Varadkar said that if PTSB had not sold the loans, the Government might have had to provide financial assistance.“We wanted those that were split mortgages to be categorised as performing but we just didn’t win that argument, so unfortunately they were counted as non-performing loans.“PTSB was required to get those loans off their books.“If they had not done that, the bank would have found itself in a difficult position and potentially we would have had to put more money into the bank, which is something we would never do again and we managed to avoid that.“But secondly, now that PTSB has been able to reduce the number of non-performing loans on its books, it’s now in a better position to do what it should be doing, which is to issue new mortgages, new loans to people.Despite Mr Varadkar’s reassurances, Opposition parties have previously expressed concerns in relation to the sale of loans to vulture funds. Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman, Pearse Doherty, has said the “major concern when banks are selling to the vulture funds is that there is no long-term interest. The big concern here relates to certainty. Regardless of people’s opinions of high street banks, they know that they want to be here in 30, 40 or 50 years.”The issue of home repossessions was brought to the fore earlier this month following the eviction of Anthony McGann and his two siblings from a house in Co Roscommon over a debt which had not been repaid to KBC Bank. Security personnel working for the bank were subsequently attacked at the property near Strokestown. Eight people were injured and six vehicles owned by security workers parked outside were burned out."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742957.1545999436!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hunt urges eu to offer assurances to get brexit deal through parliament","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeremy Hunt who has warned the EU must provide further assurances over the Irish border backstop if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is to get through parliament. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireUK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the EU must provide further assurances over the Irish border backstop if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is to get through UK parliament.Mr Hunt said he believes the backstop is the only “outstanding issue” and can be solved, noting the EU has agreed it is temporary and the UK needs it to define “what temporary is”.He added he is a supporter of Mrs May’s deal “with those qualifications to the backstop” and predicted such assurances would sway MPs as they weigh up the prospect of a “cataclysmic” no-deal Brexit.Mr Hunt also said there is a need to have a “version” of Mrs May’s deal which they can get through parliament.His remarks came as Jeremy Corbyn urged the PM to cut the Christmas recess short and recall parliament so MPs can vote on the Brexit deal.The Labour leader said he wanted to have a vote “as soon as possible”, and accused Theresa May of trying to “run down the clock” and offer MPs a choice between “the devil or the deep blue sea”.MPs are due to return to the Commons on January 7th after a two-week Christmas break, and will begin a new debate on Mrs May’s deal on January 9th — with a vote expected to take place the following week.Mr Hunt, appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: “The EU has agreed that the backstop is temporary and what we need them to do is define what temporary is.“So my view is this is not the time to be talking about what other major changes we might be faced with making because actually we can get this through.“We can get this through, absolutely can.”Mr Hunt reiterated the need for the EU to define the temporary nature of the backstop, adding: “Because if it is temporary then parliament can live with that, but you need to show us.“So I am a supporter of Theresa May’s deal with those qualifications to the backstop and I think MPs, as they reflect on how close we are to an agreement, but also how cataclysmic it would be if we didn’t end up having an agreement we could get through parliament, the best thing is to put our heads down and make sure we have a version of this agreement that we can through parliament.”Asked if he was interested in becoming Conservative Party leader, Mr Hunt replied: “I think we have a very good leader of the Conservative Party, a very good prime minister, frankly, doing probably the most difficult job of any leader in the Western world right now, and what we need to do — as she’s battling for Britain — is get behind her.”Mr Corbyn, in an interview with the Independent, refused to be drawn on whether Labour would seek to extend Article 50 to keep the UK in the EU for longer, and said: “Lots of things are possible, the EU has longform on reopening and extending negotiations, but let’s not jump too many hoops when we haven’t arrived at them.”Mr Corbyn also said it was in Mrs May’s hands whether she should recall parliament a week early, on January 2nd.“I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it,” he told the paper.“But it looks to me the Government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week.“We need to have that vote so a decision of parliament can be made. What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”A Downing Street source labelled Mr Corbyn’s call a “silly demand”, and said: “Following debate in the Commons, in the week commencing January 14th MPs will vote on the Brexit deal.“Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan, and only intends to frustrate Brexit — ultimately betraying the referendum result.”Elsewhere, shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to support if the prime minister’s deal is rejected.The shadow chancellor told the Financial Times such a move would “run the clock down even further towards March 29th”, when Britain is due to leave the EU. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742894.1545979494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new york skyline lit up blue after transformer explosion","story":"A bright blue light lit up the New York skyline on Thursday night after a transformer exploded at an energy facility.

Photograph: Jeenah MoonBloombergA bright blue light lit up the New York skyline on Thursday night after a transformer exploded at an energy facility.The blast prompted a brief fire at a sprawling Con Edison facility in Queens — but no injuries — and a spectacular illumination that generated a flurry of online commentary.The explosion affected subway service in the area and caused a brief ground stop at LaGuardia Airport, which experienced power outages.Governor Andrew Cuomo described a “major electrical failure” at the electrical substation along the East River, near the Rikers Island prison complex and across a small bay from LaGuardia.Power had been largely restored to LaGuardia by 11pm and the airport was resuming normal operations.The lights caused a stir on social media as several witnesses posted photographs and videos of a bright, blue flash that filled the night’s sky.The Manhattan skyline and iconic East River bridges were suddenly silhouetted against a backdrop of pulsating light.People flocked to social media to find out what happened and to share their views of the plumes of smoke pouring from the transformer.“It was pitch black outside and then suddenly the whole side of the eastern sky was lighting up and changing colours,” said Madeleine Frank Reeves, who saw the lights from her Upper West Side apartment. “It lasted a couple of minutes.”Some observers wondered whether aliens were invading and joked that the trend of gender reveal parties had finally gone too far.Television host Keith Olbermann referred to the episode as the “Blue Light Special.”“Something insane is happening in the sky above Manhattan right now,” New York University sociologist Eric Klineberg wrote on Twitter under a video of the flashing sky.Mayor Bill de Blasio’s spokesman Eric Phillips tweeted that the lights were attributable to a “blown transformer.”John Tebbett, who lives two blocks away from the facility, told NY1 the explosion was followed for about five minutes by a loud roar.The blast had caused the lights in his home to flicker off and on, he said.– AP"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

The town has been governed for the last two years by the Manbij Military Council, which is allied to the SDF.A convoy of American Special Forces and Syrian Democratic Forces fighters makes a stop during a patrol near the Turkish border in northern Syria on November 4, 2018.It is the first major concession by the Kurds to the Bashar al-Assad regime since the YPG seized control of vast swathes of north and east Syria and created an area of self-rule.Until last week the YPG had the support of the US, which had helped them stave off a threatened offensive by Turkey and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and hold territory wanted by the Syrian regime.A number of Syrian troops arrived in the area early Friday morning and deployed between YPG and Turkish-backed forces west of Manbij.The US-backed coalition had a number of special forces stationed in the city, where they have a base. It is understood they will withdraw in the next few days.Men queue up to buy bread outside a bakery on the outskirts of Qamishli in northern Syria, A Syrian army spokesman said in a televised statement that all Syrians must “join efforts to preserve national sovereignty” and “defeat all invaders”, with reference to Turkey.The town of some 100,000 people fell to moderate rebel fighters in the summer of 2012 before it was overrun by Isil jihadists in 2014. It was then captured by SDF in an anti-Isil offensive in 2016.The Kurds have used the cover of the war to carve out an autonomous state in northeastern Syria. However, their project seems increasingly under threat as Assad’s regime looks to reclaim the whole of Syria.Kurdish officials have told The  they would rather try their luck in negotiations with the regime than risk an all-out assault from neighbouring Turkey, which considers the YPG a terrorist group and has watched Kurdish expansion with growing concern.“The YPG accepts drinking the poison to stop a massacre. Do you prefer your people to be massacred by a brutal dictator like (Turkish president Recep Tayyip) Erdogan or be protected by a brutal dictator like Assad?” tweeted Kamal Chomani, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.Kurdish fighters from the People\u0026#39s Protection Units (YPG) run across a street in Raqqa during the offensive against IsilRussia, which has long called for the withdrawal of US troops “illegally” in Syria, welcomed the news on Friday, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the development as a positive step that could help stabilise the situation.Speaking in frank terms on Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria, Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary, today said the US president “makes a speciality of talking in very black and white terms about what\u0027s happening in the world.”We have made massive progress in the war against Daesh (Arabic acronym for Isil), but it\u0027s not over and, although they have lost nearly all the territory they held, they still hold some territory and there is still some real risk, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.During a visit to Iraq this week, Mr Trump declared an end to the US role of being the world\u0027s policeman.Arab leaders have in recent days taken steps to rehabilitate the brutal Assad regime, with the UAE and Bahrain announcing they are to reopen embassies that had been shut since the beginning of the civil war.Please review our commenting policyWar\u0026#39s deadly toll on children: Unicef warns of dangers facing millions in 2018British women who died in Iceland car crash named, as family reveal struggle to obtain visas in wake of tragedyLondon theatre: the best plays, pantomimes and musicals on nowAngelina Jolie hints at move into politics and possible run for US presidentRoyal Mail accused of disrespect by mixing up D-Day beaches with Indonesia in stamp blunderUS government shutdown to continue into new year as Congress locked in row over border wallBlue flashes light up New York sky after explosion at electric power stationPersonal info of 1,000 North Korean defectors leaked from resettlement centresEU commissioner backs new laws for social mediaGermans turn against New Year fireworks amid calls for banWolf population surpasses \u0026#39viability\u0026#39 level in France, reigniting row over its protected statusNumber of knives being smuggled into Britain doubles, Border Force data showsJapan’s resumption of commercial whaling may kill industry2018 heatwave boosted tree disease and numbers of toxic caterpillars, says National TrustComment: Despite the Brexit warnings, Britain has never been a better place to liveSmuggling charges cap chaotic year for family behind Korea’s flagship airlineThailand steps closer to recognising same-sex civil unionsMakers of Chinese herbal ‘anti-cancer drink’ investigated after death of 7 year-old girlWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/27/TELEMMGLPICT000184384065_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"angelina jolie hints move politics possible run us president","story":"Angelina Jolie during her turn as a guest editor on Radio 4\u0026#39s Today programmeHollywood actress Angelina Jolie has hinted she might enter politics and even run for US President.The film star who is a worldwide humanitarian campaigner said she “would go where I am needed” when asked if she would contemplate a political career, potentially by entering the race for Democrat party presidential nomination.She indicated she had the attributes - no skeletons in her closet, a tough chin and open thinking - but said she was also happy with her current role as a UN Special Envoy which gave her the chance to work with people in need as well as governments and the military.“So for now, I will stick quiet,” she concluded when asked about her political ambitions while guest editing BBC Radio Four’s Today programme. The “for now” was picked up by the interviewer.“If you asked me 20 years ago, I would have laughed. I really don’t know. I always say I will go where I am needed.“I don’t know if I am a fit for politics but the I have also joked that I don’t know if I have got a skeleton left in my closet. I am pretty open and out there. I can take a lot on the chin. That’s good. I honestly will do whatever I think can really make change.“Right now I am able to work with a UN agency to do a lot of work directly with people in need. I am also able to work with governments and with the military.“I sit in a very interesting place of being able to get a lot done without a title and without it being about myself or my policies. So, for now, I will stick quiet.”Asked about the rise of nationalism which has seen Donald Trump pursue aggressive ‘America First’ policies, she drew a distinction between patriotism and narrow nationalism.“I am a patriot but I am also an internationalist and I love and value other people and other countries,” she said.“To be a patriot is to be very proud of your country and even your country first but you do not think your country is better than others.”This contrasted with a narrow nationalism where people were encouraged to believe that only their problems were the ones to worry about, rather than global issues.On social media, she revealed that neither she nor any of her children were on Facebook because she had found no need to be, but agreed she would warn them about the risks of potential online harms if they chose to join.She said she tried to ensure her children saw “the good stuff” on social media, but admitted that, like any parent, she struggled to control their use of tech. “They can get round us pretty easy,” she said.She said all her children had seen inaccurate claims about them even from those “considered serious news people.” “They have a very odd sense of who is telling the truth and what they believe or trust,” she said.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie pictured at the 2007 Golden Globe AwardsIn addition to her film career, Jolie has been noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG).She has promoted causes, including conservation, education, and women\u0027s rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR).As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry.For a number of years, she was described as the world\u0027s most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity.Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016.

Observers have pointed out the picture actually shows American soldiers leaving a landing craft in what was Dutch New Guinea.Royal Mail has been widely criticised for planning to release a stamp marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day using an image of US troops landing in what was Dutch New Guinea, almost 8,500 miles from the Normandy beaches.The stamps, priced at £1.25 each, were due to be released in 2019 as part of a ‘Best of British’ collection.Captioned ‘Allied soldiers and medics wade ashore’, the image was supposed to depict the amphibious landings on the coast of northern France on June 6, 1944. However, after being previewed on social media, many observers pointed out the geographic error.One commentator on Twitter called it a “disrespectful sloppy blunder” while another said: “Having worked 3 years for Royal Mail, this does not surprise me at all”. Another tweet pointed out that the Royal Mail had released a series of stamps in 1994 commemorating 50 years since the landings, with correct imagery.The image, an official US Coast Guard photo, appears on the website of The National WWII Museum, an American site containing thousands of photographs and oral histories of the war.It first appeared in the July 1944 edition of ‘All Hands’ magazine and clearly states it shows troops carrying stretchers from a landing craft at Sarmi, Dutch New Guinea - now part of Indonesia - on May 17, 1944.The D-Day landings occurred almost a month later - and thousands of miles away - on the coast of northern France, in what was to be the start of the final allied effort from the West against Nazi-occupied Europe.British Commandos of 1st Special Service Brigade landing from an LCI(S) (Landing Craft Infantry (Small)) on \u0026#39Queen Red\u0026#39 Beach, SWORD Area, at la Breche, at approximately 8.40 am, 6 June 1944. The Royal Mail says its 2019 Special Stamp programme is supposed to commemorate anniversaries and celebrate events and popular culture relevant to UK heritage and life. Images such as birds of prey and scenes depicting British engineering excellence are planned, as well as six stamps of Queen Victoria at various stages in her life, and four of her husband Prince Albert.The D-Day landings were to be marked with a set of 11 stamps, in what the Royal Mail said “will be a timely commemoration of all those who participated and will use images from the day itself”.Paul Woodadge, 49, a D-Day historian and former tour guide living in Normandy, told the BBC: It\u0027s quite shocking really. It\u0027s going to be the 75th anniversary of D-Day - the last one where there\u0027s any veterans around who will remember it.These stamps are the kind of thing people will buy for their fathers and grandfathers.A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: “We work very hard to ensure that our Special Stamp programme appropriately commemorates anniversaries and events that are relevant to UK heritage and life.We would like to offer our sincere apologies that our preview release for our 2019 Special Stamp programme included a stamp design which had been incorrectly associated with the D-Day landings.We can confirm that this image will not be part of the final set, which will be issued in June 2019.Please review our commenting policyRussia plans school for military priests at \u0026#39Game of Thrones\u0026#39 churchWar\u0026#39s deadly toll on children: Unicef warns of dangers facing millions in 2018British women who died in Iceland car crash named, as family reveal struggle to obtain visas in wake of tragedyAbandoned by US, Syrian Kurds request help from Assad regimeLondon theatre: the best plays, pantomimes and musicals on nowAngelina Jolie hints at move into politics and possible run for US presidentUS government shutdown to continue into new year as Congress locked in row over border wallBlue flashes light up New York sky after explosion at electric power stationPersonal info of 1,000 North Korean defectors leaked from resettlement centresEU commissioner backs new laws for social mediaGermans turn against New Year fireworks amid calls for banWolf population surpasses \u0026#39viability\u0026#39 level in France, reigniting row over its protected statusNumber of knives being smuggled into Britain doubles, Border Force data showsJapan’s resumption of commercial whaling may kill industry2018 heatwave boosted tree disease and numbers of toxic caterpillars, says National TrustComment: Despite the Brexit warnings, Britain has never been a better place to liveSmuggling charges cap chaotic year for family behind Korea’s flagship airlineThailand steps closer to recognising same-sex civil unionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/21/TELEMMGLPICT000182216811_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNadeZm0KzkFwpSYJhHDpPdnmtm3XWosTHgZTwfmkibw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"russia plans school military priests game thrones church","story":"Russian Orthodox priests bless S-400 surface-to-air missiles in Crimea in NovemberWhen chaplain Mikhail Vasilyev\u0027s parachute malfunctioned during a low-level training jump in central Russia in 2007, it wasn\u0027t a miracle of God but his military training that saved his life. The jet blast had tangled the parachute lines only 1,300 feet above the ground, so he pulled the canvas to partially open it, and turned just in time to hit the deck with both feet out.“I prayed and then landed,” said Father Mikhail, head of the church at the airborne forces headquarters in Moscow. “It was a lot of force… If your legs aren\u0027t even, you can break them.”He suffered a spinal fracture but survived.While Father Mikhail gained his experience over two decades accompanying Russian troops to war...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

In “Playtest”, starring Wyatt Russell, the front cover of\u0026nbspEdge\u0026nbspmagazine indicates that there is a review of “Bandersnatch”\u0026nbspinside. In the scene, Sonja uses the magazine to encourage Cooper to take a mysterious job with video game company SaitoGemu.\u0026nbspThe episode opens with Stefan at home with his father, a widow, offering him a choice of breakfast cereal (the first decision the user is faced with). From there, he travels to an interview with a\u0026nbspgames company so he can pitch his idea for a game adaptation of the multiple choice novel, Bandersnatch, which was written by a man who descended into madness as he completed it.\u0026nbspAt the office, he is introduced to Colin Ritman\u0026nbsp(Coulter), Stefan\u0027s hero, and a man with whom you can have either a lot or barely any interaction with, depending on the choices you make. Throughout the film there are loops that guide you back to the correct narrative if you stray too far, such as when Stefan is asked whether he wants to work in the office or at home, on his own. The home option is preferred as it leads to Stefan\u0027s own slow descent into madness as he becomes obsessed with completing Bandersnatch.As he works, he becomes more and more irritated by interruptions from his father, and trips to his therapist. You can learn during therapy\u0026nbsp(as we did in this version of the story) that his mother died in a train crash after Stefan caused her to miss an earlier train – an event that likely triggered\u0026nbsphis current mental health issues.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

Essential viewing.It transpired that we managed to jump on one of the speedier narratives for the film, which comes\u0026nbspto a rather gory conclusion when\u0026nbspStefan bludgeons\u0026nbsphis father to death, but manages to complete the game. Bandersnatch is released to rave reviews, as a current-day news report informs us that Stefan was later arrested and charged with his father\u0027s murder.\u0026nbspThis writer was slightly sceptical at how Netflix is managing to get viewers to watch the episode countless times to see the various endings... meaning mega streams for them. At first the interactions are fun, but the constant interruptions to the story as you\u0027re asked to make yet another decision on Stefan\u0027s behalf can become\u0026nbspquite wearisome, and if anything it pulls you out of the story rather than allowing\u0026nbspyou to become engrossed in it.Netflix says of the new interactive film: “There are choices to be made, challenges to overcome, dangers to encounter and, as always in life (and Black Mirror), consequences to be had. Choosing wisely could lead to triumph while taking the wrong path could end in disaster – but who’s to say what’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, anyway? And fret not because once one experience comes to a close, you can – and should! – go back and make a new choice, alter the path of your story and maybe even change its outcome.”The liveblog has now closed.\u0026nbspInteractive film was released on Netflix today (Friday 28 December)Bandersnatch\u0026nbspoffers viewers the chance to decide the fate of its lead character, computer game creator\u0026nbspStefanAudience members can choose anything from the song he decides to listen to, to whether he attends a therapy sessionSo it\u0027s clearly messing with our heads, as I\u0027m sure was the writers\u0027 intention. I am very slightly sceptical at how Netflix is managing to get viewers to watch the episode countless times to see the various endings... meaning mega streams for them.\u0026nbspAnyway. Initial thoughts: At first the interactions are fun, but the constant interruptions to the story as you\u0027re asked to make yet another decision on Stefan\u0027s behalf gets quite wearisome, and if anything it pulls you out of the story rather than allows you to become engrossed in it.\u0026nbspI can\u0027t begin to imagine the slog it must have been to film every single option, edit it, splice it all together, and even just work out all the different strands and weave them back together for the five alternative endings. Bandersnatch seems more an exercise in alternative TV\u0026nbspthat makes us pose questions about our own viewing habits than a particularly good piece of drama in itself.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNetflix also confirmed that there are “five main endings with multiple variants of each”... although fans could uncover more depending on the choices they make, allowing for a little extra mystery.\u0026nbspRead our review of\u0026nbspBandersnatch,\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 1.6 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That tweet raised concerns that the Trump administration is aware of something that markets are not privy to.President Donald Trump has been publicly supportive of Mr Mnuchin, but reports from CNN indicate that he may be frustrated with his Treasury Secretary. Mr Mnuchin supported the appointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Powell has implemented monetary policies that Mr Trump has criticised.“They’re raising rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think they will get it pretty soon. I really do,” Mr Trump said on Christmas of the Fed’s decisions to raise interest rates. Mr Trump was in Iraq during a surprise trip to visit American troops when markets closed on Wednesday, and had not tweeted the entire day.Analysts suggest that the administration’s comments about the economy may be driving some of the declines that have been seen recently.Callers to White House get automated message apologising for shutdownMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunWhat does the US government really mean and why is it happening?Children will still be able to track Santa\u0027s progress on Christmas Eve“The president’s angry talk about his displeasure with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is a great example of the old adage ‘loose lips sink ships,’” Tom Block, the Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told MarketWatch. “Markets would not take well to the overt politicization of the Fed with the firing of the chair over displeasure with interest rate policy”.Others, meanwhile, have raised concerns that the declines represent real stresses on the markets.“The market’s volatility still seems to us to be more of a ‘run’ on the equity market based on fear rather than fundamentals,” said Dan Suzuki, portfolio manager at Richard Bernstein Advisors, told that website.Mr Suzuki noted that the ongoing government shutdown could be impacting stock market rates.“The difference between a run on the banking system and a run on the stock market is that the banking system has an explicit government backstop (FDIC),” he said. “In stark contrast, not only does the stock market not have a government backstop, but many of the drivers of the current volatility directly stem from government policy (trade, oil prices, the Federal Reserve, the government shutdown)”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces.

The question is, how poor will it be. “For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Human beings are the most adaptable organism that has ever appeared on the planet and is extraordinarily resourceful, and very good at looking after itself. If it turns its attentions to looking after other things as well, which it is equally good at, if it bothers to do so, then there is hope.”He added: “I think it’s unlikely that my great grandchildren will ever see what I was able to see when I was wandering around the Earth in Borneo or wherever else 50 years ago.”Civilisations to collapse because of climate change, says AttenboroughThe Blue Planet and Dynasties narrator also said that a child’s innate curiosity was a “precious treasure”. He continued: “There is not a child born that, if it sees a snail for the first time crawling up a window pane, doesn’t think, what on earth is that? How does it stick on? What does it feed on? Look at the underside... What is it doing?”“Of course every child born is born with a curiosity for the natural world. If you lose that thing that you started off with, you’ve lost really one of the most precious treasures you have. Your life is the poorer.”“The paradox is, that we may be the most overcrowded people that have ever lived in history but in fact we get a wider view of the world than ever before.

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal.

The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/17/instagram.jpg","title":"instagram update latest scrolling why reverse old version guide swipe","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The message that pops up when the update arrives offers some clue about why this happened: Stories.Instagram update completely changes how users scroll through feedInstagram notes that the feature is more similar to the Stories tool that rolled out in 2016, allowing people to post disappearing photos and videos that could be clicked through in exactly the same way. It even tells people that they can use the same feed in just the same way.Since 2016, Stories has become probably the most quickly growing kind of media ever to be launched: not just on Instagram but everywhere on the web, the side-swiping, clicky way of getting through an app has spread itself across the entire internet. Instagram Stories is now twice as big as rival Snapchat, and makes up a major part of the way people use the app.Presumably excited by the vast popularity of those Stories, Instagram has decided to make everything else work that way, too.It is worth noting that even as Stories have gone from strength to strength, and Instagram has continued to grow, the company\u0027s founders also recently left the company. That was because of disputes with owners Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the direction of the company, according to a report in Bloomberg\u0026nbsp– and it may be that features such as these were the cause of those disagreements.It seems to be on its way to everybody, though that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll definitely have got it yet. Force quitting the app and scrolling around a little appears to make the new feature most likely to arrive.Usually, new Instagram features – especially ones like this, which bring dramatic changes – are rolled out slowly, to a small group of people first and then gradually to everybody else. But this appears to have come in one fell swoop, on Thursday afternoon UK time.They hate it. Almost everybody seems to absolutely despise the update.Searching for the word Instagram on Twitter brings a whole host of posts, many including explicit language unfit for this website.Give me back my timeline, one illustrative but relatively family-friendly post reads.\u0026nbspThis update SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: no. Instagram isn\u0027t giving its users the ability to use the old format, even temporarily: once the update has arrived, it has arrived forever, by the looks of things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/10/roseanne-barr.jpg","title":"roseanne barr israel parliament speech knesset","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 1.6 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A disastrous idea from HuntAt customs in the Russian capital Ms Brady told the receptionist about the horses’ ordeal which “elicited in response the sad tale of the Finnish ambassador’s parrot”.The cable goes on: “The receptionist, an animal-lover and close to tears at the thought of the parrot, relented and led us through a maze of ceiling-high packing cases in the enormous warehouse.\u0026nbsp“And there we found the staff of the twelfth diplomatic customs post playing poker.“Fifteen dollars poorer but with the customs formalities completed we hotfooted it to the station accounts office in south Moscow.”Finding that office closed, they returned the next day to discover that as the horses had been in the station for 24 hours they needed to be re-checked by a vet.The cable continues: “The vet was in her office adding up extremely slowly a long list of figures on a calculator with dodgy batteries.\u0026nbsp“The numbers kept fading, at which point she began again at the top of the list.”\u0026nbspAfter an hour of this frustrating scene they got the necessary paperwork.But as preparations were made to transport the horse-box Ms Brady noticed the three grooms who had travelled with the animals “began to carry countless sacks of potatoes, onions, carrots and at least 200 large melons”.It adds: “One groom explained that as Turkmenistan had no post-1992 banknotes they were forced to bring wares to sell in Moscow to be able to buy the return ticket to\u0026nbspAshkabad.”The manure-filled carriage had to be cleaned before they could leave the railway siding, so a train driver was bribed with “several particularly large” melons to move down the track where it could be “unceremoniously scraped out onto the track”.With both horses finally in quarantine awaiting transit, Ms Brady signs off: “I have made some useful contacts over the last few days so the next time we want to import a horse to Russia it will be a doddle.”Mr Major wrote a thank-you note, saying: “Your splendid account of how to put a\u0026nbspTurkmeni\u0026nbsphorse into quarantine was the most enjoyable document the Private Office have put into my weekend box in a very long time.“I am most grateful to you for your valiant and amusing efforts, in this noble cause.”Created with Sketch.

independent equine experts who was helping get the horse to the UK, had a conviction for fraud.After the story was published, senior civil servants advised the prime minister against accepting Mr Meddes’ offer to withdraw from the operation on the grounds that the horseman had “served his sentence for his crime, so it’s a bit odd if we bar him from helping”.But in a handwritten note, a senior

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off.

I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it.\u0026nbsp“But it looks to me the government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week.\u0026nbspWe need to have that vote so\u0026nbspa decision of parliament can be made.

This was the 29th recall during a recess period since 1948.\u0026nbspOther issues MPs have been ordered back to Westminster over included a debate over the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013, and the riots in London and other English cities in 2011.In order for parliament to be recalled,\u0026nbspthe speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, must receive a formal request from the government which he would\u0026nbspthen consider and make a judgement on.As it stands, MPs will return on 7 January after a two week Christmas recess, but the prime minister has already summoned her cabinet a week earlier on 2 January to discuss no-deal preparations.Corbyn pledges to end law which criminalises rough sleepersMr Corbyn added that the government should not have gone into recess without a vote on the deal: “The prime minister and the Tory chief whip agreed the timetable motion, we agreed the timetable motion which was a five day debate, and it was put at that time at that week to ensure the select committees could have a chance over a week to comment on the agreement before it was put to parliament.“I agreed with...\u0026nbspI thought that was a sensible way of doing it. You would have the process in the EU, you had Theresa May agreeing it with the EU, you then had a short gap, about a week, in which everyone could analyse it and consider it and then come back to the House for a five day debate and then a vote.”He continued: “Three days into that they, the government, unilaterally pulled it and that shows the weakness of the system in the House of Commons where essentially the government holds the aces because they control the programme.“I said this to the parliamentary Labour Party and it\u0026nbspwas seen as a slightly odd thing to say – I said, actually, for a party that wants to go into government, I want to see the House of Commons stronger than it is, not weaker than it is, because\u0026nbspgovernments should be held to account by the parliament.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The scene in Launcelot Close, Andover, where the body of a man has been found after an explosion caused a building to collapseShoppers enter the Selfridges store on Oxford Street during the Boxing Day sales in LondonBarbary macaques at Blair Drummond Safari Park have a great time finding the tasty morsels hidden amongst the wrapped parcels given to them by keepers.

Britain\u0027s foreign secretary says Brexit negotiations are in the final phase and that he is confident that an agreement will be reached with the European Union.But Labour itself is not without its own internal battles over Brexit. Asked to pinpoint the most difficult moment of 2018, Mr Corbyn said it was “bringing the party together over attitudes towards Brexit and the European Union”.\u0026nbspHe said the unanimity achieved at party conference was designed to bring both leavers and remainers together on two things: “The direction of social and economic policy by the Labour Party, and the other is of course the relationship with the European Union.”Now Mr Corbyn is facing demands from anti-Brexit activists within the party to convene an emergency conference to reevaluate the party’s strategy in the coming weeks – ahead of any vote – but the Labour leader said he did not “at this stage see the need for a special conference”.“A special conference would take some time to organise anyway,” he added. “I think we do have the agreement of conference on the overall position, and we do have a very large and representative national executive. But obviously if the national executive wanted to hold a special conference they would say so, but I have not had any indications of that from members.”In the interview, Mr Corbyn also claimed he was “totally” ready for any snap election, saying the party had already selected candidates in all of its marginal seats.\u0026nbspOne path towards a general election would be through tabling a motion of no confidence in the government. If it passed and a new government attracting the support of a majority of the House cannot be formed within 14 days, parliament is dissolved and a vote triggered.Pressed on whether Labour intends to make such a move in the coming weeks, Mr Corbyn said: “We’ve made clear it’s a question of when not if we do a vote of no confidence in the government, and obviously we do at a time when their confidence is the lowest ever, which I suspect will be after they’ve lost the vote.”\u0026nbspHe would not be “tied to a date”, but said if Ms May loses the vote “we will obviously make our views clear in the House”.“I’m not certain what the result would be,” he added. “We would obviously put a case of no confidence with the government at an appropriate time.”But if Mr Corbyn’s wish of forcing a snap election fails to come to fruition, the next vote is scheduled for May 2022 – and the prime minister has already said on the record she will hand over the keys to No 10 to one of her Tory colleagues before that vote.\u0026nbspIf he remains in post as Labour leader, Mr Corbyn will be facing his third prime minister as Labour leader. He chose not to name who his preferred challenger would be when Ms May resigns, however, and said he did not want to “ruin somebody’s chances by naming a favourite”.Asked whether he ever felt sorry for the prime minister – an emotion expressed by the former Labour leader Tony Blair – Mr Corbyn said: “At a human level I have great interest in other people and I often feel sympathy for the positions people have got themselves into.\u0026nbsp“But then I also look at her cabinet, look at the decisions they are making, look at the way in which universal credit impacts on the poorest, look at the levels of poverty around this country, and I feel angry and disgusted that we are just tolerating the institutionalisation of food banks, begging, rough sleeping in this country.\u0026nbsp“No, it’s a symptom of a deep malaise of 10 years of frozen wages and lack of investment.”Due to the unremitting sense of crisis at the top of the government and a prime minister struggling to retain any degree of authority, one of the criticisms often levelled at Mr Corbyn is that Labour should now be at least 10 points ahead in the opinion polls. Instead, the party is often on a level pegging with the Conservatives.\u0026nbspWhen questioned on this, Mr Corbyn replied: “I wish we had even more support than we do have, but we have fought many election campaigns, many local election campaigns, and we did win councils that people said would be very difficult to win back.\u0026nbsp“I would also say, generally speaking, the only time that the majority of the media have given us anything like a fair hearing was during the election campaign, and rapidly after the election campaign they reverted to type and we’ve had unremitting hostility from most of the media ever since then, and we continue to have it.”Referring to an incident in the Commons last week when he was accused of calling the prime minister a “stupid woman” – he later denied this, saying he said “stupid people” – Mr Corbyn said Labour’s strength was getting out its message through social media.\u0026nbspPMQs session\u0026nbspFollowing the bustup in the chamber, the Islington North MP said a video produced by his team the following day, which also criticised the media, received half a million views in just a few hours.\u0026nbspBut before he intends to build on the party’s social media output and daily campaign work, Mr Corbyn said he will bring in the new year with his wife, Laura Alvarez.\u0026nbsp“I don’t drink so there’s not much celebration in that sense,” he said. “We will enjoy the new year, Laura and I. We look forward to a new\u0026nbspyear.\u0026nbspAnd I always make sure in my own life that I\u0026nbspwork very hard at my job – and I do a lot of travelling and working and I love being a constituency MP – but I also make sure I have other things to do.

At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its like I’ve known her all my le and this is like my missing link.”Encouraged by host Ranvir Singh, the pair then kiss for the camera but Sarah quickly pulls away before Paul says: “She’s very shy, we’re very shy.”Sarah adds: “Our first kiss was our wedding kiss and there are not many couples that can say they never even kissed before they’ve made that commitment to each other.”Paul, from Chichester, and Sarah, from Tunbridge Wells, but originally from New Zealand, first matched on the dating app on December .They spent the next few days constantly talking on the phone before the idea of getting married was raised by Paul.He told GMB: “The whole idea of marriage at first sight came up when we were texting.I’d never seen it [the TV show] before in my le but we’d connected on so many dferent levels that the whole meeting and physical attraction thing didn’t matter too much.“We’d both been on dating sites and apps and I think we’d got bored of them because everything seemed too fake and once we started talking and messaging, everything seemed so real.We were open and honest with each other - that to us seemed more important than physical attraction.“There are lots of things where you go out on date and you pick small parts out of people. You’re looking for reasons for why not to.”Their first face-to-face meeting was on Christmas Eve at Gatwick Airport - dressed in their full wedding regalia - before boarding a plane to Vegas.Sarah: “I didn’t know what he looked like. I’d seen three pictures. It’s all been a whirlwind. We got married the same day on Christmas Eve.“We’d talked on the phone a lot. It was three days before the marriage idea came up I knew. If you know you know.”They booked the Ballagio Hotel and Casino for their venue and although Sarah admitted the idea was “crazy” they were both determined to go through with it.Asked whether they fancy each other, Sarah exclaimed: “Absolutely,” and Paul said: “Definitely.”They both agreed they would have still marriedthey didn’t find each other attractive.Sarah said: “It’s about who someone is on the inside. You can marry the gorgeous man of your dreams and the next week, god forbid, he gets horribly disfigured - would he be any dferent He’s still the same person on the inside so I feel like it didn’t matter.”The couple say they’re not in love yet, but they’re learning.Sarah said: “I love him utterly as a person.”Paul added: “I love Sarah for who she is and just likes marriages across the world, we will grow to love each other.”Both have been wed before, with Sarah’s previous marriage only lasting six months, and Paul has two daughters aged  and , from his previous relationship.Its since emerged that Paul, who works in broadcasting, was jilted by his ex-finacee just a month before they were due to marry earlier this year.Paul said Teri Shurety, , from Farnham, Surrey, who runs a pet services firm, said he was left heartbroken after she broke off the engagement.He told MailOnline: “My fiance left me four weeks before the wedding so that was £, down the drain and I didnt get a penny of it back. Its taken me quite a while to get back to who I am.”Sarah is understood to still live with ex-partner but is planning to sell her house so she can move in with her new husband."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-940263432.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mega tsunami could devastate britain canary islands volcano","story":"Professor Stephen Sparks, who is based at the University of Bristol, has revealed what could happenthe Cumbre Vieja spout in the Canary Islands was to suddenly blow.“When you have volcanic islands sticking out of the sea, they’re very unstable. And, in some cases, you can get gigantic landslides when part of the island essentially collapses into the sea,” the volcanologist told Express.“And you can get tsunamis from that and they’re quite signicant. In neighbouring islands they could be enormous.“It’s quite dficult to know how dramatic these tsunamis would be around the Atlantic Ocean - on the east coast of the USA or Europe. I mean they could be quite signicant.If there was a major eruption a huge wall of water could be created by landslides smashing into the Atlantic Ocean after breaking away from the island of La Palma.Although Florida and the Caribbean are predicted to suffer the greatest destruction - with waves topping ft hitting their coastlines - some experts say a killer wave will also strike Britain.In a worst case scenario, thousands of people living in Britains southern coastal cities and town could be wiped out within hoursa mega-wave hit without adequate warning.The giant tsunami would be like the one sparked by the killer eruption of Mount Anak Krakatau in Indonesia at the weekend.Earlier research from Dr Simon Day, of University College London, foundthe volcano  - which last erupted in  - were to blow large parts of its western face could plummet into the sea.Others experts say the tsunami story is a myth and point out that the vast majority of eruptions do not lead to any kind of landslide activity.They also say the current indications are that any recent landslides may have been gradual, and therefore would not generate tsunamis unless they suddenly increased in magnitude.This could see a killer tidal wave crashing into Britains coastal towns and villages.The reports authors said: “The maximum impact would be felt in some key places in the Canaries… in La Palma, the city of Santa Cruz would be hit by two simultaneous flood waves with devastating consequences.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

a series of tubes that distribute air to the lungs.The unnamed patient died a week later.This picture has to be seen to be believed, but a man lived with a spoon in his oesophagus for a year.The man, from China, swallowed the spoon on a dare, according to Live Science.It got stuck in his oesophagus but didnt cause him any pain, so he left it.It wasnt until he was punched in the chest a year later than he began experiencing chest pains and trouble breathing as the spoon had moved.It took doctors at Xinjiang Meikuang General Hospital two hours to remove the spoon.A bizarre lump that appeared on a womans face was actually a parasitic worm crawling under her skin.The Russian woman first noticed the lump under her left eye but in a few days it had moved.The woman tracked the small lump taking selfies every time it moved.Her first picture shows it just below her left eye, but five days later the worm had crawled to above her eye.Ten days after the first noticed it the worm had crawled all the way down into her lip, causing it to swell up.The -year-old then went to see an eye doctor who noticed the lump was moving around the upper left eyelid, according to the report in the New England Journal of Medicine.Tests confirmed the woman was infected with a parasitic worm that naturally infects dogs, cats, foxes and other wild mammals and it was surgically removed.A man died after catching a rare form of mad cow disease from eating squirrel brains.The -year-old experienced cognitive decline and lost touch with reality before he was brought to hospital in , according to a new report on his case.Scans of his head revealed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a fatal brain condition caused by infectious proteins called prions.The hunting fan, from New York, reportedly ate squirrel brains, which could have triggered the condition.The man was left unable to pee for four days after a -minute kinky spanking session.The unnamed -year-old turned up at hospital covered in red lacerations and bruises across his bum and thighs after being hit more than , times with a wooden cane and whip.He told doctors at the Klinikum Stuttgart Hospital in Germany that the BDSM session lasted  minutes, and that he was struck while being tied down to a wooden bench.Medics believe blunt force trauma to his kidneys and a surge of creatine in his bloodstream caused his symptoms, according to the British Medical Journal case report.Youd think anything going through ones skull would be enough to cause some serious damage.But this boy had a lucky escape after his skull was pierced by a meat skewer.The skewer went through the -year-olds face and into his head.The boy, Xavier Cunningham of Missouri, was playing in a treehouse when wasps attacked him, causing him to fall off the treehouse ladder and onto a rotisserie skewer that he and his friends had placed in the ground, local news outlet KCTV reported.Scans showed the skewer had gone through his head to the back of his neck, completely missing critical areas like his brain and nerves.Doctors were able to remove the skewer and he made a quick recovery.One bloke ended up in AE suffering thunderclap headaches after eating the worlds hottest chilli pepper.The unnamed man began dry heaving as soon as he swallowed the Carolina Reaper pepper.His pain was so severe he rushed to hospital, where concerned doctors tested him for a number of neurological conditions.But when those tests came back negative, the patient was sent for a CT scan.It showed several arteries in the mans brain had narrowed, making it harder for blood to flow through.Doctors diagnosed him with thunderclap headaches, caused by reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome- thats narrowed arteries to you and me.RCVS is temporary, and causes sudden narrowing of the blood vessels.As a result, a sufferer is left with a drop in blood flow to the brain, and a surging headache.A woman who kept falling over and felt tingling in her legs was shocked to discover the cause.The -year-old ended up in hospital where medics scanned her spine.To their surprise, they found tapeworm larvae wriggling around the patients vertebrae.The French woman, who is not named, arrived at hospital complaining of suffering what felt like electric shocks running down her legs.A scan showed a lesion at her th vertebra - in the middle of her spine.Surgeons investigated and found the lesion was in fact tapeworm larvae, caused by an infection of Echinococcus granulosus - a small tapeworm found in dogs and some farm animals.The man had a -inch hand-held shower head removed from his bum after he accidentally slipped in the bathroom.The -year-old, from India, had to detach the PVC pipe connecting the shower head to the wall to get to hospital.Upon admission to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in New Delhi the man denied he had put the shower head there himself.His vitals were stable and there was no evidence of blood in his rectum, according to the BMJ case report.Scans revealed the shower head was six inches deep into the mans pelvis, but had not caused any internal damage.The man was put under general anaesthesia while doctors removed the object.The now -year-old assumed the contact lens had fallen out, but in fact it had moved behind her eye - yet didnt cause any symptoms for years.Then suddenly, six months before doctors discovered the lens, the unnamed woman started experiencing pain and swelling behind her eye.It appeared the size of a pea to start with, but still didnt causing any discomfort. Quickly it began to grow larger and became painful to touch.She was referred to an eye specialist at NHS Teeside by her GP, but the cause of the swelling remained a mystery.An MRI of the eye showed a cyst behind her left eye and she required surgery to remove it.It was during the surgery that doctors realised the cyst was a hard contact lens.You cant blame a man for trying to get the most out of his sex le.But for one poor bloke, his quest for a mind-blowing bonk ended up backfiring in a horrendous way.To help him last longer between the sheets, the unnamed -year-old tried a new brand of condom that promised extended-pleasure.But pleasure quickly turned to pain when he suffered an allergic reaction.The man went to King Georges Medical University in Lucknow, India after his penis began to swell up, became painful and parts turned black.The new brand of condoms contained a topical medication, benzocaine.The doctors noted: Benzocaine as a local anaesthetic suspending agent is used in extended-pleasure latex condoms for prolonging the duration of sexual intercourse and to decrease premature ejaculation.He developed contact dermatitis after using them.Doctors had to improvise when this unlucky man went to hospital.The unnamed man turned up at AE with a  inch dildo lodged inside him, having struggled to remove the toy at home.Deciding he needed expert help, the red-faced -year-old went to hospital  hours after the dildo became stuck.He told doctors he was suffering from mild abdominal pain, but other than that had no symptoms that were causing concern.Doctors at ASST Great politan Hospital in Niguarda, Italy, tried to remove the dildo using standard techniques, where a tube and grabbing device is inserted, but nothing worked.Stuck for ideas on how to remove the dildo, the quick-thinking medics invented a new tool, using medical wire to latch on to it and pull it out.Threading the wire through a catheter tube to create a noose at the end, they were able to insert the tube into the mans colon and reach the sex toy.The noose of wire was then looped around the dildo, like a lasso, and tightened until doctors had enough grip to pull it out.A MAN was rushed to hospital after blasting a hole in the back of his throat when he tried to stle a sneeze by closing his mouth and holding his nose.The -year-old spent a week in hospital, barely able to speak or swallow, after the sneeze.But experts have said the man, who has not been identied, was lucky not to have suffered worse injuries.And they warned holding your nose and closing your mouth when you sneeze might seem the polite - and most hygienic - thing to do, but it could prove dangerous.The patient had been previously fit and well before presenting at AE complaining he was finding it extremely painful to swallow, and could barely speak.Doctors examined the man, and heard crackling sounds in his neck, all the way down to his ribcage.The noises were a sign that air bubbles had found their way into the deep tissue and muscles of the chest.After a CT scan, specialists discovered the man had ruptured his pharynx.After seven days, the patient was well enough to be sent home, but doctors warned him never to block both nostrils when he sneezed again.The -year-old from India was referred to hospital with a wound on his genital region  days after first seeking help.He initially went to a primary care clinic where he told doctors he had an ulcer on his penis that developed  months ago and hadnt disappeared.The patient also suffered from severe swelling and skin shedding for several months before seeing a doctor.But two weeks later he was sent to hospital as his pain worsened and the the ulcer on his penis caused it to fall off.Clinical examination revealed almost complete loss of phallus, Dr Gaurav Garg, from King Georges Medical University in India, wrote in the BMJ case report.Tests on the residual penile stump revealed the man had squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancerThe man almost died after his bowel became so full with poo it burst and caused his organs to start shutting down.The -year-old was taken to hospital after suffering with tummy pain and diarrhoea for a week.The patient, who was autistic, had a history of chronic constipation and had been admitted to hospital a number of times over the last four years.Examination showed he had a tender, swollen abdomen with minimal bowel sounds.His rectum had dilated up to cm inside his body and was filled with faeces, according to the BMJ case report.Two days later he ed to Newham University Hospital in London suffering inflammation in the stomach and reduced consciousness.Further tests revealed his blood was becoming too acidic and his kidneys were starting to fail.A second CT scan found a substantial perforation of his bowel and he was rushed into surgery where doctors were able to close the tear."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458540730.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chinese scientists cheap copper gold hot gas","story":"The Chinese research team managed to turn cheap copper metal into a new material almost identical in composition to gold using jets of hot, electronically charged argon gas.The fast-moving ionised particles blasted copper atoms off a target metal sheet.As the atoms cooled down and condensed onto the surface of a collecting device, a thin layer of ‘sand’ began to form.Scientists noted that each grain of sand was only a few nanometres in diameter – around  th the size of bacterium.After putting this sandy material into a reaction chamber, it was used to turn coal into alcohol.During the process, the copper nano particles that made up the sandy substance acted in the same way a precious metal would behave, with scientists hailing the process a success.The astounding discovery was made by a team of scientists from the Institute of Chemical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Liaoning as they tried to find a ‘gold replacement’.However, before rushing out to turn your own coppers into little nuggets of gold, it’s worth noting that this new material created in the Chinese labs is still essentially copper.It will however be beneficial to the world of manufacturing as the new material has been found to resist high temperatures, oxidisation and erosion.Professor Sun Jian described his team’s findings as: “Like a warrior with golden armour in a battlefield, capable of withstanding any enemy assault.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458556546.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"christmas couple ruined broken lift trapped sandwich

old who also have health complaints, according to Lyn and Stephen Phillips, who live on the th floor who added that going up and down the stairs is not an option for some.The first lt broke down earlier this month and was reported to Bristol City Council but residents were told engineers were waiting on a part.Then the second lt broke down on Christmas Eve at around pm meaning many residents became “prisoners in their own home”.The council said engineers had been sent out to fix the problem but were unable to keep the lts working, Bristol Live has reported.They apologised to the residents and said working on getting at least one of the lts operational was a “top priority”.Lyn and Steve claim they were “trapped” in their flat since Christmas Eve.Lyn,  who suffers from angina, said her Christmas had been ruined because of it.She said they were forced to eat a cheese sandwich for their Christmas dinner as they couldn’t travel to their daughter’s house where they were expecting to spend the day.Lyn said: “I have already had a heart attack and am currently trying to fight off a chest infection with antibiotics, so there is no way I could climb  flights of stairs.“Christmas was completely ruined for us.“We have become prisoners in our own home. It’s absolutely disgusting.”Husband Steve is an insulin dependent diabetic.Lyn added: “I don’t want to leave the building and then not be able to get back into my home - or even worse get stuck in the lt when it breaks down.”She also said she was worried about other residents in the block who were in their s and had mobility issues.Debra Salisbury, whose -year-old mother lives in the block, also said she was worried about her mum and how the emergency services would gain access to the flats.Visitors can be buzzed into the building who then have access to the lts but to get access to the stairs they need a key fob to be able to open another door.This means residents have to walk down the stairs to the ground floor to let people in, including the emergency services.A typed note on one of the lts says: “Dear tenant, due to the non availability of a replacement lt motor drive unit for lt number one, we have had to remove the existing unit to vendors for repair.“Unfortunately due to the holiday period we cannot be guaranteed a deliverydate.“We will refit the repaired unit as soon as it is available.“Stannah apologise for any inconvenience this may cause anyone.”But now a handwritten note has been added to the bottom of the signs which says: “Apologies both lts are now out of order awaiting parts. Please contact the council for updates.“Sincerest apologies for the inconvenience.”A spokesperson for Bristol City Council said: “We apologise to residents of Winterstoke House for any inconvenience caused by the broken lts – especially at this time of year when friends and family may be visiting.“The fault on the second lt was reported to us at around pm on Christmas Eve.“An engineer attended the same day, and was able to get the lt operational, but unfortunately it then broke down again.“The other lt has been out of action for ten days, and we are currently waiting for a part to be refurbished. We hope this will be done in early January.“However, making sure at least one lt is working has been a top priority for us. Caretaking staff are also on site to help vulnerable residents throughout the day.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449596618.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"when is parliamentary vote on brexit","story":"But when is this set to take place  Why did the Prime Minister delay the vote  And what happensher Brexit deal fails to pass Theresa May’s crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal has been pencilled in for January , The Sun can reveal.The PM dramatically abandoned the ‘Meaningful Vote’ scheduled for Tuesday - after MPs had already debated it for three days.She took the unprecedented step after admitting she was on course to lose heavily.Yesterday No confirmed the vote would not be held before Christmas but “as soon as possible” in January.But they have conceded that they will be forced to start the process again by holding a full five days of debate running up to the vote - instead of resuming where they left off last week.That process would start on Monday January  - and culminate with a vote a week later on January , Cabinet sources said.The Government has committed to holding it before January .However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has urged May to cut MPs Christmas break short for an earlier vote.He accused her of trying to run down the clock as he told The Independent he wants the PM to recall parliament a week early on January .The UK is set to leave the EU on March , , at am.Many have cast this is the day of reckoning, when Britain faces the ultimatum of a new deal, or crashing out with a no-deal Brexit.MPs will be voting on the withdrawal agreement that was approved by EU leaders on November , .Parliament has demanded that the Brexit treaty can only be ratied by the Government after it has been “approved by a resolution of the House of Commons on a motion moved by a minister of the crown”.The vote will be a straight yes no format, in a bid to make a decisive and unequivocal decision on the PMs deal.It is expected that MPs will be able to vote on amended versions of the deal too.The outlook doesnt look good.Theresa May has already had two Ministers resign over the deal, and her own Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, also quit as the draft deal was presented to Parliament.Labour and factions within her own party have declared their intention to vote against it.Then there is the prospect of a vote of no confidence in the PM, which would likely derail the whole process.If Mrs Mays withdrawal agreement makes it through the Parliamentary vote, it becomes a bill, which means even more voting.This is arguably even harder, because MPs will have all the details, and every element will be under scrutiny - and up for another vote.If the agreement is rejected, Labour has pledged to call a vote of no confidence in the Government in an effort to force a General Election.Hardcore Eurosceptic Conservative MPs could also call a vote of no confidence in Mrs May as party leaderher deal fails to win approval.Other EU leaders tried to help Mrs May by warning there will be no second offer.But France and Spain turned the screw on Theresa May as they vowed to exploit the Brexit deal to extract big concessions on fishing and Gibraltar.The PM has begun a tour of all four corners of the UK to sell her deal, travelling to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.But The Sun can also reveal that Cabinet ministers are planning for Britain to join an EU halfway house, EFTA, with the help of Labour rebels after giving up hope that the deal will pass.Writing in The Sun, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab calls on the nation to “steel ourselves” to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal and make the EU one final offer insteadOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Plane-spotter Alan Meloy, who describes himself as a “nut” for all things aviation, stood on his door-step in Chapeltown, Sheffield taking photos of aircrafts above him before he noticed something quite profound about one plane in particular. Quickly snapping the unusual plane, Mr Meloy immediately recognised the jet’s iconic liveries and identied it to be the Air Force One, the plane of the US President.   At this point Mr Trumps Iraq visit was still top secret - he and First Lady Melania had left Washington DC under the cover of darkness in complete secret. So when Mr Meloy posted the image on photo-sharing site Flickr to seeanyone  had spotted it, he was met with some scepticism, as the plane was flying under a  callsign to keep the trip a secret. But when other enthusiasts spotted the image and also recognised it as one of the two VC- planes used as Air Force One, they cross-referenced it with tracking data and deduced the president was likely to be on his way to the Middle East. With the news being so widely discussed online thanks to the photo, a ban previous reporting embargo of the trip was lted by the White House, several hours ahead of schedule.   Mr Meloy, meanwhile, has found himself in a media frenzy on both sides of the Atlantic. Its one of those weird moments where youre right place and right time,” the former NHS worker told the . Boxing Day dawns clear and bright, the next thing theres an interesting airplane. Donald Trump headed to Iraq for a surprise Christmas visit to US troops, alongside his we Melania. Its Trumps first visit to US troops overseas since becoming president. Trump and first lady Melania Trump met with military personnel on Wednesday at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. He has made the trip despite the US Government being shutdown over a budget impasse as Trump holds out for bn in funding for a border wall. Trump recently announced that US troops would be withdrawing from Syria, a decision which prompted his Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis to resign. He also said about half the troops in Afghanistan would be heading home. Today Trump said he has no plans at all to remove US troops from the country.  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted: President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrice and to wish them a Merry Christmas. Veteran White House correspondent for CBS Mark Knoller reported that Air Force One was boarded in privacy in the hangar and departed under cover of darkness. All on board instructed to pull down window shades and surrender cell phones, he tweeted.   Journalists who travelled with the president were not allowed to report on the visit until more than two hours after they landed. National Security Advisor John Bolton is also in Iraq for the visit. Trump had tweeted that he was alone in the White House on Christmas Eve and sent of a barrage of tweets.His silence since late on Christmas Day sparked questions about his movements. He cancelled a Christmas trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida shortly after it became clear a deal would not be reached over the budget and the government would be shutdown.

The two lts in Winterstoke House, Ashton Gate, Bristol - which shares an estate with two other high rises - have been out of order since Christmas Eve. There are  flats within the building, which houses people over  years old, many of whom have health complaint, according to Lyn and Stephen Phillips, who live on the th floor. One of the lts was reported broken to Bristol City Council earlier this month and residents have been told that engineers were waiting on a part, Bristol Live reports. But then around pm on Christmas Eve the second lt in the building broke down - leaving the dozens of residents who live there without any lt at all. Have you had a Christmas nightmare  Email webnews@mirror  Bristol City Council has said engineers were sent out the same day to fix the lt but they have been unable to keep the lt operational. The council has also apologised to residents who have been inconvenienced as a result of the broken lts and said getting at least one lt working was a “top priority”. But this has done little to appease those residents who face up to  flights of stairsthey want to leave their own home. Lyn and Steve say they have been “trapped” since Christmas Eve. Lyn, who is -years-old and suffers from angina, said her Christmas has been “ruined” as result. She said that the pair ended up eating a cheese sandwich for their Christmas dinner as they were unable to leave the building and travel to their daughter’s house where they were supposed to spend the day. “I have already had a heart attack and am currently trying to fight off a chest infection with antibiotics, so there is no way I could climb  flights of stairs,” added Lyn, whose husband Steve is an insulin dependant diabetic. “Christmas was completely ruined for us.  “We have become prisoners in our own home. It’s absolutely disgusting.” The pair, who have lived in Winterstoke House for four years, said engineers had been visiting the building on and off since Monday trying to fix the lt. “Occasionally they would get it working again but then it would break again a couple of hours later,” she added. “I don’t want to leave the building and then not be able to get back into my home - or even worse get stuck in the lt when it breaks down.” But the pair said it was not just themselves they were worried about, but the other residents who live in the building who they say are a lot worse off than them. “We have people in their nineties living here, people with mobility issues who rely on the lts to get in and out of the building,” added Lyn. Debra Sainsbury said she is worried about her -year-old mother Maureen who lives on the fth floor of the building.  “Some of the people living in these flats are vulnerable older people so this whole experience has been really horrible for them,” she added. “My mum has had to tackle five flights of stairs in order to get out of the building.” Ms Sainsbury has also said she is worried about emergency services being able to access the building. Winterstoke House has a buzzer system which allows residents to buzz in any visitors from their own flat. Once buzzed into the building visitors have access to the lts, but in order to access the stairs they need a key fob to open another door. This means that residents have to walk down the stairs to the bottom floor in order to let any visitors into the building - this includes emergency services. Bristol City Council has said that the fire service has special key fobs that allow them access to council buildings, therefore they would not have an issue entering Winterstoke House. But other emergency services would need to have the door opened by the caretaker or a resident to get access to the stairs while the lts are broken. “It’s just really worrying to think about what would happenmum, or any of the other residents, had an accident in their flat and couldn’t get down the stairs to let the ambulance service in,” added Ms Sainsbury. Signs have been put up in the building informing residents of the issues with the lts by the lt company Stannah.  A typed note on one of the lts says: “Dear tenant, due to the non availability of a replacement lt motor drive unit for lt number one, we have had to remove the existing unit to vendors for repair. “Unfortunately due to the holiday period we cannot be guaranteed a deliverydate. “We will refit the repaired unit as soon as it is available. “Stannah apologise for any inconvenience this may cause anyone.” But now a handwritten note has been added to the bottom of the signs which says: “Apologies both lts are now out of order awaiting parts. Please contact the council for updates. “Sincerest apologies for the inconvenience.” In a statement on Wednesday, Bristol City Council said the contractors had been back on site, and it was hoped that one lt would be up and running by the end of yesterday. A spokesperson added: “We apologise to residents of Winterstoke House for any inconvenience caused by the broken lts – especially at this time of year when friends and family may be visiting. “The fault on the second lt was reported to us at around pm on Christmas Eve. “An engineer attended the same day, and was able to get the lt operational, but unfortunately it then broke down again. “The other lt has been out of action for ten days, and we are currently waiting for a part to be refurbished. We hope this will be done in early January. “However, making sure at least one lt is working has been a top priority for us. Caretaking staff are also on site to help vulnerable residents throughout the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family overwhelmed incredible gesture after","story":"NewsFamily overwhelmed by incredible gesture after burglars stole Christmas presentsMum Suzie Purvis, from Sunderland, was devastated when she discovered thieves had broken into her garage and helped themselves to gtsShareCommentsBySonia SharmaMulti-Media Journalist:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video strangers-rallied-after-mums-presents-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family who thought their Christmas had been wrecked after heartless burglars stole all their Christmas presents have had their faith in humanity restored by kind neighbours. Mum Suzie Purvis was devastated when she discovered thieves had broken into her garage and helped themselves to gts. But after word of the break-in spread, dozens of people - including strangers - sent them so many gts that their living room was packed on Christmas morning, Chronicle Live reports. As it turned out, her sons, Theo, four, and Jude, two, ended up being given a large number of presents and had a magical day. Suzie was so overwhelmed with the generosity her neighbours showed that she has now decided to give the extra presents to charity. Suzie, of Hetton-le-Hole, Sunderland, said: I cant even begin to thank all those people who came forward and gave us presents.  We went from being heartbroken on Christmas Eve to absolutely overwhelmed the next morning. People were sending us gts all evening. It got to a point where I had to tell them there was no more room in my living room. Just a few hours before, Suzie had been distraught after she discovered their garage had been broken into. She had kept all her gts, including toys for her children, wrapped up in the garage. However, at around pm on December , she found they had all gone. The -year-old, a midwe, said: The garage is about m away from our house and I went to get all the presents in so the children could open them the next morning.  When I opened the garage, there was nothing there. Everything had gone. It took me about  seconds to realise someone had broken in and taken them all. The only thing left was a box of Jaffa Cakes. They took the toys I had got for my children as well as gts for friends and family. There were clothes, selection boxes, little stocking fillers and other presents. I didnt know what to do.  Suzie told family and friends what had happened, and rang the police. Messages were also put on Facebook and soon people started to send gts. A group of friends started organising presents, said Suzie. Then friends of friends and their families joined in as well, and we started getting gts from so many people, even strangers. People were sending toys, electronic items, Xboxes, bikes, scooters, chocolates, and lots of other things the whole evening and past midnight. People were still messaging me into the early hours. It was absolutely jam-packed here. I was totally overwhelmed by the generosity. And the boys had a magical morning. To see their little faces when they got up - it brought me to tears. It was very emotional. We thought our Christmas was ruined but all these people came to save our Christmas and it made it all the more special for us. It was just incredible and I want to say thank you to every single person who brought us gts. Now Suzie has decided to give away all the extra presents. The food items will go to foodbanks and the remaining gts will be donated to childrens wards at Sunderland Royal Hospital and the University Hospital of North Durham.  At this stage, it is not clear when the burglary took place. It could have been around a week before Christmas Eve. A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: At .pm on Monday, police received a report of a burglary on Shaftsbury Park in Hetton-le-Hole. Officers attended the scene where unknown offenders had gained entry to a garage and stolen a number of items including toys and clothes.

In emails obtained by The Sun, Meghan Markle discussed plans of how she would give the drug to guests when tying-the-knot with former partner Trevor Engelson in Jamacia, in .When a friend advised Meghan to buy a special bag for the cannabis, she reportedly replied “Already ordered ‘em. And teeny ones for the pot that say ‘shh’.” A source also told the newspaper that Meghan even helped roll the illegal drug into joints and placed filters into each before putting them into the party bags.  Meghan and her ex-husband are alleged to have purchased the drug from staff member of the Jamaica Inn hotel, in Ocho Rios.“It didn’t seem like it was really her thing,” the source told The Sun .“Trevor and his friends definitely had more experience with it. I think she is more of a champagne and rose kind of girl. It almost looked like she didn’t know how to smoke. “It is not something that was very much ‘her’, but it was part of the theme and the couple were very excited to have this surprise gt for the guests.  “It was a destination wedding in Jamaica, so they thought it would be appropriate and cool to supply this. She thought it would make it memorable. “She was excited about making that a thing, showing a cheeky side people wouldn’t have imagined she had, especially at her wedding.” Meghan’s estranged father, Thomas Markle, also confirmed the drug was given to guests earlier this month - but these emails confirm prove the Duchess’ involvement in the stunt.  At the time of the wedding, possession of marijuana was illegal in Jamaica. It has since been reduced to a petty crime offence, carrying lesser implications. Meghan split with Engleson in , before dating Prince Harry three-years-later.  Earlier this year, Meghan’s -year-old nephew Tyler Dooley was revealed to be a cannabis farmer in Oregon. He released a line of the drug called ‘Markle Sparkle’ in time for the Royal Wedding in May, hoping to capitalise on the ceremony.

It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I think I’ll ever do.”  Teenager Dylan also spoke about his first night sharing a room with his entire family in a BB. He said: “I couldn’t sleep. It was a house full of strange people, you don’t know what they’re like and there’s not even a lock on the door.” However their fortune for this Christmas has completely changed and Tanya says it is one that they will never forget. Taking advantage of the thousands of pounds worth of spending money for the week, the mum decided to treat her family this year. Tanya took her children to a fancy French restaurant sampling snails for the first time.   And making their Christmas even more magical, she splurged on a ft Christmas tree for the living room costing pound. No expense was spared for their festive meal as she bought a turkey with all the trimmings. Enjoying a taste of Noels luxury lestyle she paid a visit to his favourite wine merchant and picked up a pound bottle for their dinner. And Santa was very kind to the youngsters this year, after Tanya bought her children a mountain of presents. She also remembered those less fortunate, much like her own family the previous year, and spent some money on gts for disadvantaged people.  Tanya said: “People are looking at me because I’ve got so many bags. “I’m going into nice shops and looking at the size not the price. It’s the best feeling. I want to do this every Christmas.” “We’ve bought some gts for homeless families. Some games, toys and chocolates. “It’s easy to see the sleeping bags in doorways but there are a lot of homeless kids in BBs, up and down the county. They’re the forgotten homeless. “It’s nice to let them know we are thinking about them.” Meanwhile Noel and Lisa along with their two children Amber, , and Aysha, , often spend the Christmas holidays in Thailand.   As the parents both grew up in council estates, they thought they would be more prepared for the swap - but were shocked at the state of the home. The weekly budget of pound. also came as a surprise to the wealthy dad. Noel said: “I really can’t believe that someone with three kids is living in a house with no carpet whatsoever in . It’s unbelievable.” He added: “That’s pound a day which has to all go on food. “I don’t know what we’d dowe had to buy nappies or anything . I don’t know how she manages.”  Noel and Lisa also became emotional during a trip to the food bank, where demands quadruple at Christmas according to the manager. Noel added: “You can’t help but be moved by seeing people coming on their last hope to get food for their children. But when they turn up there they are treated with kindness and people who say ‘you’re in trouble, we’ll look after you.’ We need organisations like that. After Tanya and her children ed to the special surprise from the Hogans, she revealed that the experience has left her with a positive mindset. She said: “At Christmas you realise what’s important and it’s love and family. Things like that you can’t buy. “Money isn’t what makes a person. It’s your morals, your work ethic. This has revitalised me and it’s made me think about how I can push my business forward.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast second beast","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Second Beast from the East to batter Britain in New YearThe Met Office is also warning of snow hitting parts of the country as dense fog could cause chaos for travellersShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video met-office-national-morning-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA second Beast from the East could smash into Britain this week as a polar vortex from Scandinavia is forecast to hit for the New Year. The Met Office are warning of snow hitting parts of the country as we move into January - with dense fog possibly causing chaos for travellers across this weekend. A yellow weather warning for fog is already in place across London, south-east and south-west England and went into effect from pm yesterday -predicting to last until later this morning. Now forecasters are warning of icy blasts smashing into the UK this January thanks to a phenomenon called Sudden Stratospheric Warming .SSW refers to a swt jump in temperatures in the stratosphere and is often linked to the onset of cold weather in winter.  The drop in temperatures could bring about a second Beast from the East - with the first hitting the UK in February this year, bringing freezing temperatures and thick snow to much of the country. Jeff Knight, Met Office manager of modelling climate iability said: There is a very high likelihood of a ‘Sudden Stratospheric Warming’ around the end of the year, increasing the chances of colder-than-average weather in January and the rest of winter. We will keep looking at forecasts to know exactly when any potential cold, snowy spells will occur.  Drivers are being warned about thick fog arriving for the weekend, causing possible disruption to public transport - including flights. Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said there will be dense patches of fog that will form quite quickly which could lead to some dangerous driving conditions. She said that temperatures could drop to as low as minus C in the South West, with the freezing conditions a cause of the fog blanket. The fog could cause some slower driving conditions, journey delays to buses and train services, and there is a chance of some delays to flights as well, she added.  Ms Smith said the weather will be quite cloudy across much of the UK, with the sunniest conditions across Scotland. Temperatures will be in double digits for most places, Scotland and Northern Ireland C, C across the north of England, C in the Midlands, and similar in the south, she added. It is quite mild for the time of year, tomorrow night temperatures widely are around C to C and that is what it should be in the daytime at this time of year.

George Nissen’s great-grandfather Peter Nissen designed the prefabricated semi-circular structures that were widely used in both world wars. Made from corrugated iron, the huts could be thrown up in quick time without the need for foundations and put to military use, mainly as barracks. They came into their own towards the end of the First World War, when the frontline kept moving. During the inter-war years they became popular with farmers for storage and there are still hundreds of them scattered around the British countryside. Now over  years since their were invented, the great-grandson of Major Nissen has taken out a new patent for them.   The -year-old has reinvented it into eco-friendly garden offices to cater for the ever-increasing number of people working from home. They still have the same iconic shape as the original huts, are covered in corrugated iron and are easy to construct without the need for concrete foundations. They are shorter into fit into an average-sized back garden and use sheep’s wool and plywood for insulation. Mr Nissen, an architect, said: “About two years ago I thought about redesigning the Nissen Hut to not only celebrate its centenary but also to facilitate people home working.   “Most garden offices are small boxes and we are trying to provide something a bit dferent. “The new huts are similar in design and shape but are on a smaller scale and are much better insulated. “I think my grandfather would like them.” Over , Nissen Huts were built during the First World War, with many of them being used as a makesht hospital as well as barracks. After the conflict, their designer was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his work and invention. During the Second World War Maj Nissen - a former mining engineer and inventor -waived any royalties after the huts went back into mass-production. Mr Nissen, from Queens Park, west London, said: “The original huts were designed to be easy to put up and to move.   “My great-grandfather was in the Royal Engineers and it was decided that a new storage hut was needed. “It had to be a building that could be put up very quickly with minimal foundations, but taken down when the front moved position. “After the war they were widely used by farmers and the Forestry Commission as outbuildings. “Then the Second World War came along and their production was ramped up again.   “At the time timber was used to construct them but that was stopped as the troops used this for the stove so they were double-skinned with corrugated iron. “My great-grandfather died quite young between the wars and at that point the business vanished and ious companies continued to produce them.” The new huts still have a corrugated iron roof but the main structure is made out of plywood. They have a floor space of eight feet by nine feetand they are eight feet high. The huts cost about pound, and take three days to put up. At least , Nissen huts were produced in the First World War. Nissen huts were constructed in Belmont North, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.

Arriving at the emergency room, the coating of blood on Bobbitt’s arms initially led doctors to believe he had cut himself, but removing the sheet covering his crotch would cause the doctor’s jaw to drop’, recalls the victim. Dr. James Sehn received an emergency call in the middle of the night to report to the hospital and attend to Bobbitt.

She served  days in a mental institution and now heads-up a charity working to prevent domestic violence. “I couldn’t believe it, how someone could get away with hit,” Bobbitt said of the verdict. In a later trial, Bobbitt was acquitted of raping Lorena.  The couple orced in  after six years of marriage. ‘The Bobbitts: Love Hurts’ airs on January  at pm EST on ABC.

Parents Naffi and Racheli Goldman, who live in Manchester, were horried by the comments after they posted pictures of their daughter on Facebook.They had been told by doctors that Batya was not compatible with le and offered an abortion seven months into the pregnancy. A D scan revealed she had a rare congenital disorder, and the tiny girl is deaf, blind, unable to breathe on her own, and has a malformed skull and a twisted spine. Naffi admits he was initially frightened by her bulging eyes and unusually-shaped head. This month the devoted pair shared photos of Batya on Facebook, and were horried when they were slammed by cruel critics who said their monster should be killed. But the pair insist they dont regret bringing the little girl into the world, and are raising pound, to pay for her care costs.  Naffi, from Manchester, said: We were told to abort straight away and the doctors knew she would be born with a serious medical condition. They werent sure what, but they knew Batya would be seriously disabled. We were told she wouldnt make it through birth andshe did, would die in infancy. They said caring for her would make our lives unbearable. It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear and our world came crashing down.   But God is a creator and he doesnt make mistakes. We will look after the gt we have been given. When we saw the comments on our photographs we were horried. We didnt think people like this existed. What people were saying was dreadful. People said they have never seen such an ugly child. They said our child is a creature. One person said what we are doing is abuse and someone told us she looks like some kind of monster.  People said why bring a creature into this world, you should have killed her. It broke our hearts. The couple had been trying for a baby for two years before finally conceiving Batya. Naffi says they were delighted and couldnt wait to settle as a new family in Manchester. They said all the scans throughout the pregnancy were totally normal, until they had the D scan while visiting family in near Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. Doctors said she would be born very disabled and would likely not survive, but her parents opted to reject an abortion. Naffi said: It was like an earthquake, a bombshell. We were so excited for when she arrived before the doctor told us we should kill our baby.   As soon as we walked out of the doctors office we said straight away that we will keep the baby no matter what. We felt as though it was gods will. Its what our purpose in le is. There was nothing at all to debate. We knew it would be hard but we had to accept our destiny. To us, aborting at seven months would have been murder. She wasnt a fetus, she was a real le baby. We were not prepared to take a childs le and we were defiant about not aborting.   Jewellery dealer Naffi and his we moved to Israel after the scan, to be closer to family. Batya was born deaf, blind, unable to breathe on her own, with spina bida, Pfefer Syndrome and Antley Bixler Syndrome, on January . The baby was rushed to intensive care and suffered respiratory failure during infancy and is now kept alive by a ventilator. Naffi said: She had an enlarged head and her eyes were bulging. I could see straight away that her spine wasnt straight. She was frightening to look at. It was scary for us. We knew straight away that the future was going to be very, very hard for us. This month, mum Racheli, shared photos of her baby on Facebook, and was viciously attacked by online trolls for going against medics advice.   The messages said things like do you think keeping this creature alive is the right thing to do . Another troll called Batya a sick fetus whilst one person said Rachelis baby looked like medusa, known in Greek Mythology as a monster. Both Naffi and Racheli have had to give up their jobs and spent   - in alternate shts - caring for their daughter. She requires  procedures a day that keep her alive - including round-the-clock medication and feeding via a tube. If her airways are not cleared every three hours she would suffocate. We do it out of love for our daughter, said Naffi.   We give her intensive care at home so we cant work. We do  hour shts between us. The government provide us with some equipment but we have to pay for a lot of the medication. We have to clean her ventilation tubes andwe miss a suction then she could suffocate. We work to keep our daughter alive. Around  per cent of children worn with Batyas disabilities die within  weeks but she has found a way to survive. And just like every other baby, Batya loves to be loved. Naffi, who is a grandfather and has a daughter, , from another relationship, said: She is a pampered baby for sure. She loves to be kissed, she loves to be held. She likes to know when people are around her. She cant see or hear so we try to be around her all the time so she isnt scared.   Her body has adapted to not die. She has amazed us. This is the hand we have been dealt. She has found a way to survive and we absolutely love her. The couple had planned to live in the UK full time and had begun applying for citizenship for Israeli born, Racheli. They hope to one dayto the UK to liveBatya is ever well enough to travel abroad. They receive medical equipment from the Israeli government but are trying to raise money to pay for extra care. Naffi and Rachel have set up a GoFundMe page to support their daughters care.

Nigel Jarrett, head of conservation breeding at the WWT, said: It takes a village to raise a child, so the old African proverb goes, but in this case it has taken a village to raise a duck. We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade. The logistics of working in a remote part of Madagascar - where access to the lakes by vehicle is only possible for three months a year - have been an enormous challenge, requiring us to come up with novel approaches. Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival."},{"url":null,"title":"man nicknamed alien due enlarged","story":"NewsMan nicknamed \"ALIEN\" due to enlarged head wants surgery so he can fall in loveDue to his mystery condition Anshu Kumar has deep set and narrow eyes in his head and the -year-is unable to grow more than a thin strip of hair on top of his headShareCommentsByDavid AspinallKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-cruelly-nicknamed-alien-because-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA labourer who wants to fall in love and get married is desperate for surgery as he thinks his large head is putting women off.

It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner.

We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/866573532_23823642-846x564.jpg ","title":"the vikings are coming galloway hoard treasure to visit dundee","story":"The Galloway Hoard, which brings together the richest collection of rare and unique Viking-age objects ever found in Britain or Ireland, is to come to Dundee.Billy Gartley, head of cultural services at Leisure and Culture Dundee, said: “This is very exciting news for everyone in the city and we are delighted to be working with Museums Scotland to bring the Galloway Hoard to The McManus.“This will be a great opportunity for visitors from the city and beyond to enjoy a collection of international signicance.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this. One of the endearing things about the Europeans, and I say this as a Brexiteer, is their cafe culture.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

last of the countyrsquos infant schools will disappear and a new single school will be created.However, there are no plans to move buildings, with the new merged school run across the two former education establishments.Until now the schools in the town had P-Ps attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P.However, both schools operated their own curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had opposed it.Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, said that following those results she had arranged to meet face to face with parents at public meetings in a bid to tackle their concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that there had been concerns from some parents but pointed to a recent inspection at Prestonpans Primary School which had called for additional support to be given to the school after grading its performance as weak in parts.He said: ldquoWe know we have and have had great teachers, inspiring headteachers and great support staff and yet we receive these reports.ldquoWe owe it to the children of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-700-celebrations-build-on-great-work","story":"Councillor John McMillan praised the efforts of the Haddington  team.Events have been held throughout the year to mark  years since the town received the Bruce Charter ndash the oldest document in the East Lothian Archives.The final event saw a concert held by Siobhan Miller at St Maryrsquos Parish Church last Thursday evening.Mr McMillan said: ldquoFor the children, in the Year of Young People, we finished on the John Knox and Robert the Bruce Lego event.ldquoIt was amazing and a great tribute to Ruth Fyfe and Frances Woodrow, the archivists at the John Gray Centre, who had the initial idea and have been at the heart of it all.

I argued that it was undemocratic that not a man in the land was considered for the job. The likes of my chum Elaine C. Smith argued back this didnrsquot matter. ldquoWersquove suffered from hundreds of years of patriarchy, so why shouldnrsquot women get their chance  Women In Journalism described me as a ldquomisogynistic dinosaur and Nicola Sturgeon said I was ldquooutdated and ldquoawful. Do I regret writing this piece  No. I still believe to deny men equal opportunity goes against the grain of democracy. I would still argue for as much training encouragement women need in order for them to compete in whichever work arena they choose to enter. Womenrsquos choices canrsquot ever be constrained. But men shouldnrsquot be excluded from the process.The comment however did make me ask whether I could ever support positive discrimination. The answer is lsquoYes.rsquo If two young people, for example, applied to Oxbridge, and both had the same qualications and one were working class and the other Eton-grown, Irsquod give the entry to the working class person. If the working class person were male and the other a female from Cheltenham Ladiesrsquo College again Irsquod choose on the basis of class.In a conversation last week with Jackie Bird and the issue of BBC positive discrimination strategy the news presenter said she believed in meritocracy. This was warming. This is coming from the daughter of a school janitor from Hamilton.As for the lighter fluid intro on the Zoe Ball column  Yes, Regrets on that one. ldquoTime to give Zoe Ball a little kicking wasnrsquot the best choice of metaphor. It set the tone for war.The column about race discrimination in theatre also caused a little conflict. I had found it hard to accept black actors being placed in historical white roles ndash because of anachronisms. Some actors of colour agreed with the comment. Some pointed out that grant money is often a spur to casting. But it all led to a fascinating discussion with actor Grant OrsquoRourke who argued ends-justied- means and theatre is about endless possibility, a non-prescriptive world in which a table can easily become a sailing ship. ldquoSo why canrsquot a s Hooray Henry be black  We couldnrsquot agree. But the  head will try to see past the colour of those playing our Stanley Kowalskis.The other column which saw social media go into meltdown came about after criticism of Gaelic funding. And the result was a meeting with Professor Wilson McLeod and we discussed Gaelic history, passions, and the social implications of keeping the language alive. Am I now studying Gaelic  Not at all. But I can recognise many of the reasons why the Gaelic voice is so passionate.But I know yoursquore looking for at least one act of contrition. Here it is. In the column Stressed: Stop Feeling Sorry for Yourself, I separated stress from depression. I argued they were dferent things. This was wrong. Wersquove so much more to cope with these days. We see the world so readily we canrsquot deny its confusions and disasters. We face a whole new range of problems, from the likes of technology, gender issues, paying the gas bill. My revised thinking  Depression is the next stop on the line after Stress.There are no regrets however about dissing Burns Suppers, Michelle Mone, Theresa Mayrsquos lack of empathy, Jeremy Corbynrsquos lack of cojones and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos obfuscations. And Madonna. There are no regrets about questioning rapper Kendrick Lamarrsquos being awarded this yearrsquos Pulitzer Prize for Music. I liked Darren McGarveyrsquos response to the column however in which he said in a video message running at : it was ldquoF****** s*** journalism and added ldquoThat you can have that idea that a hip hop artist canrsquot elevate a form to a high art is ludicrous. I didnrsquot say that, Darren. I said I didnrsquot see the merit in Lamarrsquos lyrics. Not the same thing, but more power to your larynx.I canrsquot say the same about my Auntie Ethel. After I wrote about MS losing the way and poorly-stitched underpants she rounded on me and pointed out the many merits of the store chain. As I head there right now to buy dinner I reckon she may have a point.So yoursquore right. I donrsquot always get it right."},{"url":null,"title":"rev-im-jolly-returns-to-the-bbc-at-hogmanay-with-gregor-fisher-sitting-in-the-famous-armchair","story":"To mark the th anniversary of the BBC comedy sketch show Scotch and Wry, the actor Gregor Fisher is to play the morose Minister for a special, one-off sketch.Taking the place of the late Rikki Fulton, Fisher will play the famously deadpan and droll role for the Hogmanay Live celebrations on BBC One Scotland.Fisher, perhaps best known for his role at Rab C Nesbitt, said: \"Irsquom delighted to do it.\"I think there was a bit of Rikki that always saw me as the heir apparent - Irsquom sure he had many heirs apparent - and I think hersquod like the idea of Jolly being back on screen again.\"Itrsquos not an impression of Rikki - there wasnrsquot any way we would even attempt that, you just couldnrsquot do it.

Going over old scripts, it struck me how the lines are still as funny today as they ever were.\"I think Gregor brings that ideal mix of deadpan droll and clever comic timing to Jolly - something Irsquom sure Rikki Fulton would have approved of. We hope the audience have as much fun watching it as we did making it.\"Gilbert added: \"Itrsquos nice to be involved again all these years later.\"Itrsquos a sketch that has a real place in the hearts of Scotland and was such a fixture of Hogmanay.ldquoInevitably, people will compare what Gregorrsquos doing to what Rikki did, but itrsquos not about that.\"Gregor is not doing an impersonation, itrsquos more of an emulation.\"Hogmanay Live is broadcast on December , at .pm on BBC One Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"castle-survives-to-become-the-most-photographed-in-the-highlands","story":"It is the most photographed castle in Scotland, and has been featured in blockbuster films from Highlander to James Bond. If you walk into any Scottish gt shops, yoursquore as likely to see Eilean Donan castle as tartan or shortbread.But for many years the castle did not look as it does now.  marks  years since the fateful battle which left the castle in ruins after destruction by the British during the Jacobite rising. years later work began on restoring Eilean Donan to its former glory by John MacRae-Gilstrap of Clan MacRae.Sitting between the three sea lochs of Loch Long, Loch Alsh, and Loch Duich, the caste has was used as a stronghold by Spanish invaders during the uprising in a bid to restore James Stuart, son of James IV of Scotland, to the throne.The castle was under heavy bombardment from British naval ships, for several days and eventually, after barrels of gunpowder were set alight, the Eilean Donan was demolished and would not be lived in for over  years.Dr Iain MacInnes is an expert in medieval Scotland from the University of the Highlands and Islands. He spoke about how the castle has had a long history of importance to Scotland:ldquoIt is perhaps its location that makes it ldquospecial, on the road to Skye, and regularly voted as one of Scotlandrsquos most picturesque castles. There is little doubting its ldquoromantic location and its general setting.ldquoThe fact that a castle appears to have existed in some form on this site from the very early middle ages suggests that it was situated at an important strategic location.ldquoIts access to the sea meant that it would likely have acted not just as a castle, but also as a harbour for ships connected to the ruling families in the area, from which they could project their sea power over the region.ldquoThis was an important part of lordship in this region, where travel by water was probably more important than travel by land. Its likely th-century origins also relate to providing defence in depth against Scandinavian raids and incursions in a period when Scoto-Norse relations were not good.Dr MacInnes also says that as with many of Scotlandrsquos Castles, Robert the Bruce may have paid a visit as part of his conquest of Scotland:ldquoClan history suggests that Robert the Bruce stayed at Eilean Donan in - on his flight westwards following his defeat at the battle of Methven, he said.ldquoThere is no corroborative evidence for this, however, and the temptation to be associated with the ldquowarrior king is quite a strong one in many clan histories, so this might well come under the heading of ldquomyth.ldquoAnd, as with many Scottish castles, there is the ghost of a mysterious lady also associated with it. Scottish folklore has a lot to answer for. There is even a suggestion of a Mathesonbeing able to speak to birds. Make of that what you will.ldquoIts lsquolast hurrahrsquo in the Jacobite uprising of  is a pretty spectacular way to go out!Between  and , work began on the rebuilding Eilean Donan by Lt. Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. As well as a footbridge to connect the island to the mainland, it was built up again to stand just as it had done for hundreds of years before its destruction.Now, visitors from all over Scotland and the world come to visit it, take pictures and even marry there, cementing its status as a Scottish cultural icon for years to come.Clan Mackenzie, along with Clan Macrae have a special affinity with the castle, as it was the stronghold of the Clan for many years. A Committee member of the Clan Mackenzie Society spoke about the long history with the iconic fortress:ldquoIt seems reasonably clear that the Mackenzies then lost control of Eilean Donan at some point by the first half of the century, they said.ldquoThen, following a long exile on the part of the chief, Murdoch Dubh, he finally seems likely to have recovered the familyrsquos power base in Kintail in a purported Royal Charter of  - which was purported to have been further confirmed in  to his son in a grant from the Exchequer.ldquoBecause of the Mackenziersquos power-base in this region it was chosen as the landing place for the Jacobite invasion which was aided by Spanish troops but defeated in the Glen near the Castle by the English General Wightman.ldquoThe Mackenzie, chief, William Dubh , the th Earl and nd Jacobite Marquis off Seaforth, played a heroic role in this Rising before being wounded and carried across the mountainsto exile and safety.ldquoThe MacRaes also played an important role in the history of the Castle, since they are a local clan who were the traditional bodyguards of the Mackenzie chief and their own chiefs had been the hereditary constables of Eilean Donan and were consequently dubbed lsquoMackenziersquos Shirt-of-Mailrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"the-iconic-the-heroic-and-the-unforgettable-those-we-lost-in-2018","story":"The music industry lost one of its greatest this year: the Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin.

Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are

With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Friday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More than , young people were at the heart of it, and planned a calendar of sporting, music and cultural events for all ages to enjoy.A world-first initiative, Year of Young People was a commitment made by the Scottish Government. Young people worked alongside decision makers to make sure they were involved in the creation of government policy. This year, they established a Youth Commission which examines mental health services. They will have a greater say in their education with the creation of a Scottish Learner Panel, and will hold those in power to account with the launch of the First Minister’s Question Time for children and young people.YoYP was delivered in partnership with local and national organisations including schools, youth work services, EventScotland , Young Scot, Scottish Youth Parliament, Children in Scotland and YouthLink Scotland.More than  young ambassadors volunteered their time to challenge the negative stereotypes of their peers. Their role is to represent their local area, promote activities and showcase the positive contributions young people make to their local community.Orkney’s Hope Laing was one of those who volunteered to be a young ambassador. She said: “Year of Young People has given Scotland an opportunity to build young people’s reputation, and provide more opportunities for them to influence and take action. “I am very proud that I have been one of the ambassadors for my area, and being involved in helping young people shine in my local community.“A few highlights are: Stromness Drama Club winning the National Youth Festival Estrella, on their amazing Young Enterprise Venture which won three awards at the Young Enterprise Finals and their Managing Director, who has been announced as Young Entrepreneur of the Year!“One group which I am part of, the West Mainland Youth Achievement Group, had success this year competing in the MoneyforLe scheme. We went to London to represent Scotland at a National level and won with our project called ‘Trash to Cash’.“During my time as ambassador, I have had the privilege to meet and work with so many people from all walks of le. Without this opportunity, I don’t think I would feel as confident as I do now when taking on new challenges.“I would like to think that stereotypes of young people in Orkney were not too bad, but this year has highlighted how much good can come from the community working together. I would like to see this continue long after YOYP  has finished.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We know it will be challenging, but we’re willing to work together.“I’m usually such a logical person, but all the rules have been thrown out.“We’ve both tried to do things the traditional way before and it didn’t work out for either of us.“We get on so well and just thought: ‘Why not have that commitment to actually making a marriage work from the very start ’ “I’m not interested in just going on dates looking for things I don’t like about that person.“I’m committing to making this marriage absolutely work - like they did in the old days.“It’s traditional, older generations might have only met their partner once or twice before getting married.“It’s similar, we just hadn’t even met before.”Sarah and Paul, who works in broadcasting, met online on dating app Bumble and instantly hit it off.She said: “I saw his profile, thought he looked nice and loved what he had written about being open and honest.“When we matched, I sent him a message.“I thought it was funny that his name was Paul as I currently share a house with two other people called Paul - so I said: ‘I’ve already got two Paul’s in my le, why not add a third ’ “He replied to my message saying: ‘Apparently the third Paul is always the best and I don’t have a Sarah in my le so I guess that would make you number one.’ “We spoke on the phone on Saturday night for two-and-a-half hours and then again on Sunday morning for an hour-and-a-half.“Sunday evening we were chatting away on the phone and calling each other for three hours.“I can’t remember who brought it up, but one of us said: ‘We get on so well - maybe we should get married’.“The other one went: ‘Yeah, maybe we should’ and it literally spiralled from there.“There was a moment between us where we both thought: ‘We totally could do this. How amazing would it bewe got married on our first date ’ “By Monday morning - three days after we’d first started talking - we’d agreed to get married.“We both just thought: ‘Let’s do this’.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849240.1545938523!/image/image.jpg","title":"glasgow queen street station redevelopment must surpass expectations alastair dalton","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...It will be an extraordinary addition to Glasgow#s cityscape, ing the railways to George Square after  years of being hidden behind an ugly hotel extension.A new fly-through video by Network Rail offers passengers further glimpses of what lies in store when the £ million revamp of Queen Street station is finally completed in .As much,not more so than with Edinburgh Haymarket five years ago, the overhaul of the station should transform its look and feel.It should prove to be the icing on the cake for the £ million electrication of the main line between the two cities - the embodiment of Scottish rail travel in the s.This is crucial because appearance and image counts for so much when trying to encourage more people to take the train rather than drive.The combination of a dramatic new frontage, lofty interior and ScotRail’s impressive new electric trains should prove an enticing combination for everyone from those who don’t travel by rail - which means most people - to veteran commuters.There is also the prospect of more and better shops on either side of the concourse, and a far enhanced space for waiting for trains, beside the huge glass frontage which will allow passengers to at last see out of the building.This is a massive opportunity to create a showcase of how good a rail station can be.But its designers should not get carried away with stunning architecture alone - travellers’ basic needs must be catered for, and not in a frustratingly “It could have been so much better” way that I have encountered where.The south-facing windows should fill the concourse with light, but will this be blinding on one of Glasgow’s many bright days Equally, in colder weather, it must be warm enough and draught-free environment to be a pleasant place to sit.Even what the seating is made of is important - metal may be easy to maintain and damage resistant, but it can be freezing to the touch, as those who use the station’s lower-level s will know.Information is also crucial, and the new Queen Street is the opportunity for Network Rail to end its infuriating practice of not installing screens big enough to show details of all trains and s at the same time.In what looks like a  economy,not simply a failure to understand passenger needs, on new screens at other stations the information is rotated, so people rushing for a train can’t immediately see from which  it’s departing.To some, these may seem like minor quibbles when the improvement to what passengers currently endure at the station will be so vast.As I wrote last year, it’s just plain wrong that passengers have been left with virtually nothing on the concourse since months before work even started there.Shops weer closed, cash machines taken away and even the ticket office relocated to outside the building. Waiting for a train there has been grim.I also said you could in theory nip out to nearby shops for food or something to read, but that relies on knowing where to go, not having heavy luggage, having enough time before your train, and it not pouring with rain.It is for Network Rail to make good its sins on that score and complete the remodelling of the station in a way that not only meets but surpasses expectations - which will have rightly built up by then.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849376.1545998214!/image/image.jpg","title":"over 68 000 newborns benefit from scottish government s baby box","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...More than , babies in Scotland have received a baby box since the policy was introduced in .The box aims to help give children the best start in le, and it contains items such as clothing, a toy, a play mat, books, a towel, a sling carrier and thermometers.The box itself can be used as a sleeping space for newborns.New figures show that as of December  this year, a box had been delivered to , newborns - the equivalent rate of around  a week.This is a dip on the level recorded at the first anniversary of the box being introduced.: Scotland’s baby box immortalised in Edinburgh’s Museum of ChildhoodOn August , , a year after the policy was brought in, figures showed , boxes had been handed out, the equivalent of , per week and representing an % uptake by parents.The projected cost of the initiative was £ million for  , rising to £. million for each of the following three years.Critics at the start of the scheme suggested that giving the box to any eligible parents, including those who can easily afford the contents, did not represent the best use of public funds.However, ministers stress feedback shows parents appreciate the universal aspect of the policy and believe it removes stigma.SNP MSP Linda Fabiani said: “It is wonderful to see so many families across Scotland benefiting from the baby box.“The boxes are a really positive Scottish Government initiative providing parents with many of the essentials they need to care for their child.“From thermometers to towels, changing mats to clothes - the boxes are a fantastic way of giving children the very best start in le.“Well over , boxes have already been provided to parents across Scotland, showing how popular they are proving with families in every corner of the country - and given how beneficial they are to parents and newborns, long may that continue.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Aimee-Fewell-4-Auchtertyre-primry.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities. It features a youth leadership project and has a youth committee.Amie Mott, centre based youth worker for the Education Authority told theeveryone was excited for the opening.She said: The refurbishment is really lovely, and was greatly needed.“The young people have been using this building for  years so the enhancement was definitely needed.“In fact, some of the young people who are currently using the centre have told us their parents actually used it years ago, so in a lot of cases we are actually working with the second generation of Ballykeel young people!”Amie concluded by stressing the imporance and relevance of the centre to the community.She said: This is an important facility in the heart of Ballykeel, and we hope the new facilities will encourage even more young people to use the building.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast residents face fourweek wait for bin collection council blames staffing levels","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What a way to discourage recycling,” one resident wrote.“People will either burn excess paper and cardthey have space to do so or bung it all in black bins or black bin bags for general waste.”In a statement, Belfast City Council said the disruption was due to staffing levels and apologised for any inconvenience.“Due to staffing levels, it has not been possible to provide an alternative collection for blue recycling bins over the Christmas and New Year period,” said a council spokeswoman.“This information was communicated to residents last week as widely as possible, via council’s website and social media channels.“We apologise for the inconvenience. Where possible, we would encourage residents to bring any recyclable materials to their local recycling centre and keep an eye on our website www.belfastcity.gov.uk holidayarrangements and social media for the most up to date information.“We would ask residents who have a scheduled black brown bin collection this weekend and their bin does not get emptied on the day, to please continue to leave it out and we will collect it as soon as possible in the coming days.”In the days leading up to Christmas, a confidential memo by a senior council official was leaked, stating that bin collections could be disrupted due to a pay dispute with staff and trade unions.Nigel Grimshaw, City Hall’s strategic director of city and neighbourhood services, said that staff would be paid time and a half for working on a Saturday , and double time on Sunday .\"However, trade unions and some staff have asked for more money to work on the above days,” he added.\"Their proposal would in effect equate to triple time.\"\"To accept this proposal without proper consideration would likely cause a precedent and would mean applying the same arrangements to other service areas that are provided over this period.\"This could cost the council up to £k additional payroll costs and would have to come out of council reserves as there is no budget for their proposal.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Guests of honour include Sir Nigel Hamilton, the Deputy Lieutenant of the City of Belfast, and councillor Carole Howard, High Sherf of Belfast.Mr Acheson said a shrinking congregation means its time to hand over the building to a new church.\"In many ways this will be a sad moment as it means the break-up of our loyal and steadfast congregation, but we are excited to see the witness in this building being revitalised,\" he said. \"Everyone will be welcome at this special service, in particular those with family, historical and other links to May Street Congregation over the years.\"Dave Dickinson from Central Belfast said May Street is ideally positioned for outreach.\"We have tried to become a community that keeps Jesus in focus and we prioritise discipleship, worship and witness as we proclaim the Kingdom of God in the centre of Belfast,\" he said.\"It is a huge blessing to have our own home and we look forward to playing our part in the transformation of Belfast.\"May Street Church opened in October  and its first minister was Dr Henry Cooke, the famous Black Man of Belfast.

What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”A Downing Street source labelled Mr Corbyn’s call a “silly demand”, and said: “Following debate in the Commons, in the week commencing January  MPs will vote on the Brexit deal.“Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan, and only intends to frustrate Brexit — ultimately betraying the referendum result.”Elsewhere, shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to supportthe Prime Minister’s deal is rejected.The shadow chancellor told the Financial Times such a move would “run the clock down even further towards March ”, when Britain is due to leave the EU."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mrs Thatcher said she wanted better training of the Garda with international forces as an urgent part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.A June  meeting between Mr Haughey and the Conservative leader saw her raise major concerns over Garda competence in the wake of the alarming upsurge in IRA violence in Northern Ireland and its success in smuggling weapons and explosives from Libya. The seizure by French authorities of the Eksund complete with  tonnes of Libyan weapons and Semtex explosives prompted the Taoiseach to personally write to Frances Jacques Chirac with Irelands thanks.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands expected at hogmanay torchlight procession","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both of you constantly took off of work and spent every dime you made just to put a smile on my face.”The note continued: “I will always remember travelling around Florida for baseball, trying to cheaply eat and save money, but I never could because you both always wanted me to have the best stuff to help me pursue my dreams.“The money you both spent on travelling, gear, hotels, food and all those Gatorades I drank is much more than I could ever give you.

present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said.

will then be published early in the New Year with a further  days then set aside for public comment before a final scheme is published.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews, who appealed to voters in Crossgar concerned about not being able to vote in their home village to respond to the consultation, hopes ldquocommon sense will prevail.He and a number of his Rowallane colleagues remain concerned that people who live within touching distance of the designated polling station at Glasswater Primary School, will have to make their way either to a church hall in Drumaghlis or Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The local politicians say it is somewhat ironic that people who live on the periphery of Crossgar will be able to vote in the village, but those who live in the heart of the village will not.They believe the Electoral Officersquos draft proposal is ldquoflawed and have warned it will particularly impact on the elderly and those who have no access to public transport.Cllr Andrews said the draft proposal will have a ldquodetrimental effect on the people of Crossgar and district.ldquoResidents in the centre of the village will have to bypass Glasswater Primary School polling station and travel three miles to vote in Drumaghlis or five miles the other way to Killyleagh, he continued.ldquoIn my opinion, this draft proposal is senseless, flawed and discriminatory and treats Crossgar residents like second class citizens. What do people who have no access to transport do when it comes to casting their vote Cllr Andrews said that with an estimated population of , people, voters in Crossgar were being treated dferently to those in Killyleagh, Saintfield and Ballynahinch.ldquoI hope this proposal will be revisited so people in Crossgar and the surrounding district can enjoy the right of exercising their democratic right to vote in their own village, something many others take for granted where in the district, he declared.ldquoThe bottom line is thatyou live in Crossgar and intend to vote in next yearrsquos council elections you will have to travel either three miles to Drumaghlis or five miles to Killyleagh which simply isnrsquot on.He added: ldquoI sincerely hope common sense prevails and that this ridiculous draft proposal will be consigned to the bin where it belongs.ldquoWhat is really ironic is that while people in Crossgar must travel outside the village to vote, those in areas including Annacloy and Bells Hill will be heading into Crossgar to cast their vote. You couldnrsquot make it up.Consultation responses should be forwarded to info@eoni.org.uk before pm this evening..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Review of recycling centres  ","story":"THE future management of the districtrsquos three household recycling centres will be discussed in the New Year.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is organising a special workshop on January  for all of the local authorityrsquos  councillors to consider a number of recommendations following a review of current operations in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan.Future access policies is one of the key areas which came in for special attention as part of the review which also examined a potential ban on taking black bin bags full of unsorted waste to any of the centres.Local authority officials have been carrying out an in-depth review of the operation and management of the centres with details of the exercise outlined last month when politicians were told that almost , tonnes of waste are taken to the districtrsquos three recycling centres each year.Councillors were also told that that the local authority is legally obliged to provide dedicated centres for household waste which are free to use.The centres are viewed as key weapons in the councilrsquos battle to reduce waste to meet a directive to recycle  per cent of all waste generated across the district by . Given the fact that this is just over  months away, the review of the current operation and management of the household recycling centres was ordered.A pound, budget is being set aside to improve the operations at all the local authorityrsquos recycling centres and to finance a new communications strategy. The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning unsorted black bin bag waste which will have a signicant impact, given that thousands of people regularly empty a iety of waste into such bags and take them to the recycling centres.Elsewhere, council officials want to challenge the perception that the household centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.Officials say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the local authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling facilities.The review also examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive. The number of recycling centres and their opening hours will also come under the microscope during next monthrsquos workshop.The event will explore the reviewrsquos recommendations and agree an implementation date, with the agreed way forward to be mapped out at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s farewell to Hugh  ","story":"SPA Golf Club brought a unique six-decade era to a close on Saturday when its longest playing member Hugh Hegan left for pastures new.Club captain in  and president two years ago Hugh has been a keen and regular competitor on the Spa fairways since his father mdash also called Hugh mdash introduced him to the sport in .Captivated by golf from the very beginning, Hugh played to a handicap of two at his peak and along the way established himself as one of the leading contenders at Spa.Over the years Hugh, who now has a highly respectable handicap of , has won many trophies including the Spa Cup mdash as a teenager in lsquo mdash Captainrsquos Day events and represented the club on Senior Cup, Junior Cup and Ulster Cup teams.As he said farewell to his many friends at Spa, before leaving for St Andrewrsquos in Scotland with his we Anne to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, Hugh reflected on the changes to the club which he will always call home.ldquoWhen I joined it was just a nine-hole course at the old Spa.ldquoThe facilities were basic to say the least.

gave the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland role to anyone with a promising political future have emerged in newly released Irish government files.The former prime minister is said to have always picked what was described as an “unspectacular appointment” which was designed to “keep things ticking over” in Northern Ireland.Irish State papers revealed that top officials in the British Government said Mrs Thatcher had modest expectations of improving the situation in Northern Ireland in .In July of that year, during a lunch between Ferdinand Mount, a former head of the Policy Unit at No , and an Irish government official, the pair discussed Mrs Thatcher’s position on Northern Ireland.After the meeting the Irish government official wrote to Dermot Gallagher, assistant secretary at the Anglo-Irish Division, and outlined the main points which Mr Mount raised.He said: “The Prime Minister, however, has never focused for very long on the Northern Ireland problem, despite the assiduous efforts ofPowell andUtley over the years to interest her in it.”According to the documents released under the Irish -year rule, Mr Mount, told the diplomat that Mrs Thatcher had “very modest expectations” about her chances, or any other Prime Minister’s chances, of bringing about a “fundamental improvement on the situation” in Ulster.The letter continued: “When the draftagreement was put to her, she accepted it, but, had it not been, she probably would have steered clear of any initiative on Northern Ireland during her period in office.“Having committed herself to the agreement, she will not ‘rat on it’. However it is very unlikely that she will ever build on it, or expand it, in any way.“An illustration of her essentially pessimistic approach to Northern Ireland is that she will never appoint as Secretary of State anyone with a promising political future e.g. John Major.“Rather she will always go for an unspectacular appointment designed to ‘keep things ticking over and no more’.” with then US president Bill Clinton.

It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

approach is to enable the birds to become accustomed to their new surroundings, increasing the chances they will remain at the site after release.The state of the wetlands in Madagascar is so poor they will likely not survivethey leave the lake.The ducks were released from the aviaries in December and very quickly adapted to the lake, ing and flying, associating with other wild ducks and ing to the safety of the floating aviaries to feed and roost.Experts from WWT, Durrell Wildle Conservation Trust, The Peregrine Fund and the Government of Madagascar have spent years laying the foundations for the birdsrsquo introduction.. \"Madagascar pochard ducks in the safety of the worldrsquos first floating aviaries on Lake Sofia in the north of the country With a wild population of just , this duck may be the rarest bird on the planet.Nigel Jarrett, head of conservation breeding at the WWT, said: ldquoIt takes a village to raise a child, so the old African proverb goes, but in this case it has taken a village to raise a duck.ldquoWe have been preparing for this moment for over a decade.ldquoThe logistics of working in a remote part of Madagascar ndash where access to the lakes by vehicle is only possible for three months a year ndash have been an enormous challenge, requiring us to come up with novel approaches.ldquoWorking with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.ldquoIf we can make this work, it will provide a powerful example not just for of how save the planetrsquos most threatened species but how communities can manage an ecosystem to benefit people and wildle, especially in areas of signicant poverty.Conservationists have been meticulously planning their release since the surprise discovery of a small group of pochards in ..\"The floating averies on Lake Sofia in Madagascar, which are housing the pochards Faced with an endless set of logistical hurdles, they have had to consistently think outside the box.Madagascar pochards spend almost all their time on water and, importantly, feed underwater.For this reason, a plan was conceived to convert Scottish salmon-farming cages into the worldrsquos first floating aviaries.After successful trials in , the aviaries were shipped from the UK to Madagascar and assembled on Lake Sofia this summer.Ducklings hatched in October were transported  miles to the lake along a dirt road and reared in lakeside aviaries.Then, in early December, just before they were able to fly, they were moved into the floating aviaries.Other floating equipment ndash feeding stations and loafing rafts ndash have also been specially designed and installed on the lake to give the birds the best possible chance of survival.With much of the wetlands across northern Madagascar severely degraded due to human encroachment, conservationists have also been working to improve the condition of Lake Sofia.Dr Glyn Young, head of birds at the Durrell Wildle Conservation Trust, said: ldquoThe idea that we could be releasing pochards into the wild only  years after rediscovery pays remarkable testament to the dreams and hard work of many people from Madagascar, Jersey and the UK, who have worked tirelessly to see this remarkable bird get a chance of survival in a changing world..push,i[r].l*new

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
