His mother is a professor of computer science at Deakin University.Venkatesh recalls having a ‘fairly normal suburban existence’ growing up, despite being a maths prodigy. As a child, he won medals in the physics and maths Olympiads before becoming the youngest person to study at the University of Western Australia at the age of 13.He went straight into second year after proving that he could answer all of the exam questions on first-year subjects.One of his earliest mentors, Professor Cheryl Praeger, described him as ‘extraordinary’.At 16, Venkatesh graduated with first-class honours in pure mathematics and went on to study at Princeton.His adviser there, Peter Sarnak, also praised Venkatesh for his ‘remarkable insights’, telling Quanta: ‘It was clear that it was just a matter of time before he was going to put things together in unusual ways.’          The Fields Medal winners pose for photos with some attendees during the opening ceremony of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Aug 1, 2018However, Venkatesh told the site that he felt like he did not have ‘a happy time as a graduate student’.‘I didn’t really feel like… I had added something very original. I don’t think I got the sense out of graduate school that I can do research.’Venkatesh tackled feeling down by reading maths texts on subjects far removed from his field—a coping mechanism that turned out to be the key to finding out what sort of mathematician he really wanted to be. A lot of his work features insights from other areas of mathematics.Venkatesh is married to Sarah Paden, who is finishing her doctoral dissertation in musicology at Princeton, and the couple have two children.What did Akshay Venkatesh win the Fields Medal for?The International Mathematical Union awarded Akshay Venkatesh the Fields Medal for: ‘His synthesis of analytic number theory, homogeneous dynamics, topology, and representation theory, which has resolved long-standing problems in areas such as the equidistribution of arithmetic objects.’Venkatesh, however, was surprised at winning the prize. \u0027It’s very difficult to grasp that I’m one of them,\u0027 he told Quanta. He didn\u0027t expect to win because his work is conjectural, whereas the traditional Fields Medal winners are ones who have solved a famous problem. Who else won the Fields Medal 2018?   This year\u0027s prize was also awarded to three other mathematicians:  Italian Alessio Figalli from ETH Zurich, German Peter Scholze and Caucher Birkar, from Cambridge. Birkar is a Kurdish refugee who came to Britain who grew up in a Kurdish city in Iran to farmer parents. His 14-carat gold medal was reportedly stolen just minutes after he accepted it at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Brazil. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle told friends \u0027if you talk to the press you\u0027re out\u0027Station 19 season 2: All you need to know about the Grey\u0027s Anatomy spin-offStephen Colbert slams Ivanka Trump on The Late Show asking \u0027what do you do?\u0027Could Love Island be axed because of Brexit? Fortnite\u0027s Week 4 challenges: Search between a gas station, soccer pitch and Stunt MountainFA Community Shield 2018 - Chelsea vs Manchester City: When is it and what TV channel is it on?As Jennifer Aniston and Kim Kardashian reveal their weight, here\u0027s what your favorite celebs weigh Who is Gul Panag?

These are high-profile videos taunting and ridiculing the 12 World gang and referring to actual fights.‘They reference murders, stabbings, drug deals, as well as appalling attitude to women. The videos incite violence.’A month earlier, Mr Westwood was mentioned at the Old Bailey by Judge Nicholas Cooke QC, who said drill music was putting innocent people in ‘harm’s way’ as two gang members were convicted of murdering an innocent music producer following a feud played out in rap videos featured by the DJ.      Both men were murdered only yards from each other on Warham Street, CamberwellDean Pascal-Modeste, 21, was stabbed 14 times by Devone Pusey, 20, and Kai Stewart, 18, as he was on his way to a recording session on February 24 last year.He was hunted down in south-east London by members of the B Side gang from Lewisham because he was friends with their rivals the Splash gang, who were locked in a ‘poisonous’ YouTube rap feud, exchanging barbs in their online videos on TimWestwoodTV. A Met Police database that tracks more than 600 suspected gangsters across 1,100 YouTube clips, names 32 videos on his channel that potentially incite violence.The DJ, who hosted the BBC Radio 1 Rap Show for 20 years until 2013, earns money from advertising on the channel.It has amassed 388million views by broadcasting clips including hundreds of rap videos from mainstream stars and suspected gang members.Many that show suspected gang members in balaclavas making threats against rivals are still on YouTube.This year, the family of a murdered teenager accused Mr Westwood of glamorising knife crime after he recorded a video with a gang celebrating the killing. Abdullahi Tarabi, 19, was stabbed after being chased through a west London estate in daylight on April 11 last year.Two 17-year-olds defendants were cleared following an Old Bailey trial last October. Around the same time, Mr Westwood posted a music video he had recorded with a rap gang when they boasted that the victim ‘got splashed and I don’t feel sorry for his mum’.The victim’s mother, Fawziya Ahmed, said: ‘This is hurtful. I can’t believe someone would say that.’It is no longer on TimWestwoodTV, but the song, Pray For The Pagans, is still on YouTube.The victim’s sister, Muna Tarabi, added: ‘How have these boys been allowed to go on with Tim Westwood, who is promoting them on his TV channel? It’s wrong. It is glamorising knife crime. They are actively celebrating it in this video and there is nothing we can do.’Mr Westwood was hurt in a shooting in 1999 after a dispute with a south London gang that was trying to extort money from him.A spokesman for the DJ, whose late father William was the Anglican Bishop of Peterborough, said he was unavailable to comment.But Mr Westwood’s spokesman has previously said: ‘TimWestwoodTV gives up-and-coming artists a platform to be heard by a wider audience.

Absolutely not.\u0027He added: \u0027If you end up with a clutch of vexatious claims then that undermines morale and has the risk of undermining our combat force and our fighting spirit. I would absolutely stamp on any of that sort of activity.\u0027 He said it was \u0027sad\u0027 that veterans were being subject to police investigations and that they would receive the full support of the military, including financing legal aid.          Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, pictured yesterday in Romania, has opened a unit in the Ministry of Defence to determine what legal  protection can be given to the service personnel He added: \u0027That apart, I can do no more than give my personal commitment to them being as fairly treated and as properly looked after as they can be.\u0027Before taking on his current job, Sir Nick served as the head of the army from 2014, during which time soldiers who had served in Iraq faced investigation by the Iraq Historic Allegations Team. The unit was handed 3,668 allegations of murder, torture and wrongdoing by British troops since 2010, when it was set up.It was forced to shut down last year after \u0027tank-chasing\u0027 lawyers deluged it with vexatious claims.Now Northern Ireland deaths are under the spotlight, with all 302 killings by troops in the Troubles being reviewed.Last month MPs attacked the Northern Ireland Secretary as \u0027close-minded\u0027 after she issued a \u0027blanket rejection\u0027 of their call for a statute of limitations – or time limit – which would have ensured veterans were protected legally from new investigations dating back to events decades ago. Karen Bradley had raised concerns that any protections given to soldiers would \u0027inevitably be extended to terrorists\u0027.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson came under fire last month for backing pardons for IRA terrorists as a price to end the witch-hunt of British troops. He has since opened a unit within the Ministry of Defence to examine what legal protections soldiers can be given.Yesterday, Sir Nick said he hoped people would not forget the important role that the British Army has played in Northern Ireland\u0027s history.He said: \u0027What we must try to remind ourselves about this whole issue is actually what an extraordinarily amazing task the British Army did through 30 years in Northern Ireland.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/03/17/4ECD57E400000578-6021421-image-a-134_1533313276150.jpg","title":"Spies turn puzzle masters second GCHQ book","story":"    The GCHQ posted a teaser on Twitter yesterday about the release of its new book using emojis.

Earlier this year Eggert accused the 57-year-old of molesting her in the 80s, but the Los Angeles DA dismissed the case in June because the statute of limitations has passed  Baio\u0027s wife of more than a decade Renee Sloan stood by his side as he addressed reporters. The 57-year-old actor claims Eggert has been harassing his family in recent weeks\u0027I have taken five separate polygraph tests given by two highly renowned examiners\u0027 Baio announced at the conference in Woodland Hills.In each test he was asked the same set of questions five times:\u0027Did you have any kind of sexual contact with Nicole Eggert before she turned 18 years old?\u0027 \u0027Did you put your finger in Nicole Eggert\u0027s vagina before she was 18 years old?\u0027\u0027Have you ever threatened Nicole Eggert that she needed to keep your alleged sexual contact with her a secret?\u0027 \u0027Have you ever exposed for genitals to Alexander Polinsky?\u0027Baio answered \u0027No\u0027 to each of the questions and the tests returned results of \u0027no deception\u0027 in each, according to a report from The Blast.Polygraph testing is viewed as controversial in the legal community, with results rarely being deemed admissible in courts of law due to suspect reliability.    Baio asserted that multiple polygraph tests showed \u0027no deception\u0027 when he answered \u0027No\u0027 to questions regarding Eggert\u0027s allegations of molestation and sexual assaultsThis week Baio filed a police report claiming that Eggert had been harassing him and his family. His wife of more than a decade, Renee Sloan, stood by as he addressed the media Thursday, saying: \u0027I went to the police because I want this to end. It’s over.\u0027Baio said he had turned over all threatening correspondence to investigators, and said he didn\u0027t want his allegation that his accuser is lying \u0027to be interpreted as an indictment of anyone except Nicole Eggert and her co-conspirators.Scott Baio is cleared of molestation allegations after the...Share this article\u0027There\u0027s no coming back from what she did. No. You say anything you want about me. You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid. You can\u0027t do that.\u0027Shortly after Eggert came out to accuse Baio of misconduct, the actor learned that his wife had been diagnosed with microvascular brain disease following years as a stuntwoman.   At the time Scott told The Blast: \u0027All we know is she must live as stress-free, depression free and anxiety free life as possible and a get good amount of sleep each night. This new disease can cause strokes and dementia.\u0027           Baio, pictured with Sloan and their daughter Bailey in 2015, said Thursday: \u0027You say anything you want about me. You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid. You can\u0027t do that\u0027Regrettably the diagnosis was followed up by plenty of stress when Eggert filed a police report in February accusing Baio of sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions beginning in 1986 when she was 14 and he was 25.The abuse continued during their time on the set of Charles in Charge until she was 17, Eggert claims.  Under the current laws, there is no statue of limitations for cases where a minor is molested by an adult, but at the time of the alleged assaults by Baio, the statute was only three years. Eggert told TMZ in May she knew the new law wouldn\u0027t be applied retroactively and that the DA would not be able to prosecute Baio. \u0027However I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio\u0027s that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.\u0027 A source told the website that officials in the DA\u0027s office found Eggert to be \u0027credible\u0027 and Baio\u0027s crimes were \u0027potentially prosecutable\u0027 were it not for the statute of limitation.  Baio has repeatedly denied that there is any truth to Eggert\u0027s claims.            Eggert said it all started when she was 14 back in 1986 on the set of Charles in Charge, the television show she worked on with Baio, who was then 25Eggert, a child actress who got her first big role in Rich And Famous in 1980, opened up about her relationship with Baio on Megyn Kelly in January.\u0027He immediately took to me and befriended me and earned my trust,\u0027 she said of the early days on Charles in Charge in 1987. \u0027And then he started expressing his love for me. And talking about marriage in the future.\u0027And then I was still 14, before my 15th birthday, we were at his house in his car in his garage. And he reached over and he penetrated me with his finger. And that is when the sexual touching and abuse started after that.\u0027She went on to claim that these incidents \u0027probably happened once a week\u0027 until she was 16, along with kissing and groping that she believes the pair\u0027s co-stars on the program saw at the time.Baio has firmly denied Eggert\u0027s allegations and said that the two did not engage in any sexual activity until she was of age.           Co-star Alexander Polinsky (center) also accused Baio of abuse. \u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert (left) and attorney Lisa Bloom (right)Eggert wasn\u0027t the only Charles in Charge cast member to accuse Baio of inappropriate conduct.Co-star Alexander Polinsky also accused Baio of abuse earlier this year.\u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert and attorney Lisa Bloom.He went on to allege that Baio once threw hot tea in his face, cut a hole in his dressing room door so he could expose himself to the youngster and even pulled down Polinsky\u0027s pants in front of 100 people on set one day. Polinsky also said he witnessed Baio behaving inappropriately toward Eggert.Baio has denied all of the allegations made by Eggert and Polinsky.\u0027Scott denies every single claim of inappropriate behavior and there is absolutely nothing when you examine the facts and the evidence and the claims that have been made - almost every one of them can be refuted with evidence,\u0027 a representative for Baio told Variety.Baio accused Eggert and Polinsky of embarking on a \u0027media tour\u0027 because they were \u0027hungry for publicity.\u0027D.A.

If ever a person came in wearing pink socks and defaulted on rent, and it became a regular problem, then we would stop renting to people who wear pink socks\u0027.                                                    Yet the increase imposed by Mr Wilson is equivalent to a hike of five per cent for tenants who were paying rent of £1,000 a month or 6.7 per cent if it had stood at £750. In a statement Mr Wilson said he was \u0027merely passing on to the tenant\u0027 the additional charge.He said: \u0027Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by £50 per month.\u0027It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately.\u0027When asked how many homes would be affected he said: \u0027About 400.\u0027Mr Wilson added: \u0027I\u0027ve done simply because the Bank of England put its interest rates up - all I\u0027m doing is keeping pace with them.\u0027When interest rates went down we actually put it down £50.\u0027If it goes down again, we would then put the rent down again.\u0027The tenants in a way are protected for up to a year by bits of legislation.\u0027If someone signed an agreement yesterday, legally they won\u0027t have to pay the increase for six months.\u0027People have to understand that there\u0027s a shortage of firemen, of nurses, of doctors, of surgeons, of bricklayers, or houses... there is no shortage of tenants.\u0027It\u0027s a big bad world in reality.\u0027If you have 20 houses and 19 tenants, then the rent goes down. If you have 19 houses and 20 tenants, then the rent goes up.\u0027At the end of the day, I\u0027m not on the Bank of England\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee, I didn\u0027t make this decision.\u0027This is not the first time the notorious 69-year-old millionaire has hit headlines.Last year he banned \u0027battered wives\u0027, single parents  and plumbers from living in his homes.He was once hauled before the courts for banning \u0027coloured people because of the curry smell at the end of the tenancy\u0027.He also came under fire last month for evicting pregnant mothers.In 2016 Mr Wilson stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the vote for Kent\u0027s police and crime commissioner, vowing to take on bullies who assault their girlfriends or wives.In 2014, he sent eviction notices to around 200 tenants on housing benefit after changing his policy to ban benefits claimants.

The BBC is planning a series about Lister, played by Suranne Jones, called Gentleman JackAdorned with a rainbow border in a nod to the LGBT rainbow flag, it acknowledges Lister\u0027s celebration of \u0027marital commitment\u0027 at Holy Trinity Church.It has provoked outrage, with more than 2,000 people signing a petition calling for the tribute to be taken down.Petition organiser Julie Furlong said: \u0027Anne is an iconic figure to lesbians throughout West Yorkshire particularly.University apologises for \u0027racist and colonialist\u0027 posters...Students paint over Rudyard Kipling poem \u0027If\u0027 just a WEEK...Share this article\u0027This has quite rightly has offended and angered many people in York and West Yorkshire.\u0027A gender nonconforming woman can be many things because it only means that you do not conform to societal expectations. It has nothing to do with sexuality.\u0027Anne Lister was, most definitely, gender non-conforming all her life. She was also however, a lesbian.\u0027That is why she took vows with her girlfriend in that church, because they were in love with each other and wanted to express that same sex love - the very definition of lesbianism.\u0027          Controversial: A petition has been signed calling for the plaque to be taken down because it describes Lister as \u0027gender-nonconforming\u0027 rather than \u0027lesbian\u0027Calling for more signatures, she added: \u0027Don\u0027t let them erase this iconic woman from our history.

The ceremony to mark the unveiling of the plaque on July 24 outside Holy Trinity Church in York, where Lister and her partner Ann Walker cemented their union in 1834\u0027The wording was shaped by several open consultations held with York\u0027s LGBT community. \u0027It was intended to highlight Anne Lister and Ann Walker\u0027s deep commitment to each other, to reflect Anne\u0027s gender-nonconforming presentation, to raise the profile of queer history and to celebrate an LBGT icon.\u0027The phrase \u0027gender-nonconforming\u0027 was not intended to be read as a replacement for the word \u0027lesbian\u0027.\u0027However, we understand and accept that it has been read in this way.

Earlier this year Eggert accused the 57-year-old of molesting her in the 80s, but the Los Angeles DA dismissed the case in June because the statute of limitations has passed  Baio\u0027s wife of more than a decade Renee Sloan stood by his side as he addressed reporters. The 57-year-old actor claims Eggert has been harassing his family in recent weeks\u0027I have taken five separate polygraph tests given by two highly renowned examiners\u0027 Baio announced at the conference in Woodland Hills.In each test he was asked the same set of questions five times:\u0027Did you have any kind of sexual contact with Nicole Eggert before she turned 18 years old?\u0027 \u0027Did you put your finger in Nicole Eggert\u0027s vagina before she was 18 years old?\u0027\u0027Have you ever threatened Nicole Eggert that she needed to keep your alleged sexual contact with her a secret?\u0027 \u0027Have you ever exposed for genitals to Alexander Polinsky?\u0027Baio answered \u0027No\u0027 to each of the questions and the tests returned results of \u0027no deception\u0027 in each, according to a report from The Blast.Polygraph testing is viewed as controversial in the legal community, with results rarely being deemed admissible in courts of law due to suspect reliability.    Baio asserted that multiple polygraph tests showed \u0027no deception\u0027 when he answered \u0027No\u0027 to questions regarding Eggert\u0027s allegations of molestation and sexual assaultsThis week Baio filed a police report claiming that Eggert had been harassing him and his family. His wife of more than a decade, Renee Sloan, stood by as he addressed the media Thursday, saying: \u0027I went to the police because I want this to end. It’s over.\u0027Baio said he had turned over all threatening correspondence to investigators, and said he didn\u0027t want his allegation that his accuser is lying \u0027to be interpreted as an indictment of anyone except Nicole Eggert and her co-conspirators.Scott Baio is cleared of molestation allegations after the...Share this article\u0027There\u0027s no coming back from what she did. No. You say anything you want about me. You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid. You can\u0027t do that.\u0027Shortly after Eggert came out to accuse Baio of misconduct, the actor learned that his wife had been diagnosed with microvascular brain disease following years as a stuntwoman.   At the time Scott told The Blast: \u0027All we know is she must live as stress-free, depression free and anxiety free life as possible and a get good amount of sleep each night. This new disease can cause strokes and dementia.\u0027           Baio, pictured with Sloan and their daughter Bailey in 2015, said Thursday: \u0027You say anything you want about me. You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid. You can\u0027t do that\u0027Regrettably the diagnosis was followed up by plenty of stress when Eggert filed a police report in February accusing Baio of sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions beginning in 1986 when she was 14 and he was 25.The abuse continued during their time on the set of Charles in Charge until she was 17, Eggert claims.  Under the current laws, there is no statue of limitations for cases where a minor is molested by an adult, but at the time of the alleged assaults by Baio, the statute was only three years. Eggert told TMZ in May she knew the new law wouldn\u0027t be applied retroactively and that the DA would not be able to prosecute Baio. \u0027However I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio\u0027s that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.\u0027 A source told the website that officials in the DA\u0027s office found Eggert to be \u0027credible\u0027 and Baio\u0027s crimes were \u0027potentially prosecutable\u0027 were it not for the statute of limitation.  Baio has repeatedly denied that there is any truth to Eggert\u0027s claims.            Eggert said it all started when she was 14 back in 1986 on the set of Charles in Charge, the television show she worked on with Baio, who was then 25Eggert, a child actress who got her first big role in Rich And Famous in 1980, opened up about her relationship with Baio on Megyn Kelly in January.\u0027He immediately took to me and befriended me and earned my trust,\u0027 she said of the early days on Charles in Charge in 1987. \u0027And then he started expressing his love for me. And talking about marriage in the future.\u0027And then I was still 14, before my 15th birthday, we were at his house in his car in his garage. And he reached over and he penetrated me with his finger. And that is when the sexual touching and abuse started after that.\u0027She went on to claim that these incidents \u0027probably happened once a week\u0027 until she was 16, along with kissing and groping that she believes the pair\u0027s co-stars on the program saw at the time.Baio has firmly denied Eggert\u0027s allegations and said that the two did not engage in any sexual activity until she was of age.           Co-star Alexander Polinsky (center) also accused Baio of abuse. \u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert (left) and attorney Lisa Bloom (right)Eggert wasn\u0027t the only Charles in Charge cast member to accuse Baio of inappropriate conduct.Co-star Alexander Polinsky also accused Baio of abuse earlier this year.\u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert and attorney Lisa Bloom.He went on to allege that Baio once threw hot tea in his face, cut a hole in his dressing room door so he could expose himself to the youngster and even pulled down Polinsky\u0027s pants in front of 100 people on set one day. Polinsky also said he witnessed Baio behaving inappropriately toward Eggert.Baio has denied all of the allegations made by Eggert and Polinsky.\u0027Scott denies every single claim of inappropriate behavior and there is absolutely nothing when you examine the facts and the evidence and the claims that have been made - almost every one of them can be refuted with evidence,\u0027 a representative for Baio told Variety.Baio accused Eggert and Polinsky of embarking on a \u0027media tour\u0027 because they were \u0027hungry for publicity.\u0027D.A.

She was shortlisted in 2011 for Half Blood Blues, her second novel, about a mixed-race jazz musician at the outbreak of the second world war. The latest book, telling the story of a young boy named George Washington Black, or “Wash”, who grows up a slave on a plantation in Barbados, taps into a wider movement in North American literature exploring the history and legacy of slavery.Attica Locke also addressed slavery in her 2012 novel, The Cutting Season, in the surreal setting of a southern plantation turned into a tourist destination. Her latest novel, Bluebird, Bluebird, follows a Texas ranger who investigates racially charged murders in a small Texas town. She worked on the Emmy-winning television series Empire and is one of the writers for the hotly anticipated Netflix series Central Park Five, directed by Ava DuVernay.Edugyan, who grew up in Alberta, of Ghanaian descent, and Locke, an African American who grew up in Texas, met for the first time last week in Los Angeles. Interview by Geeta DayalYou’ve both written eloquently about race. How much personal experience is in your fiction?Attica Locke: I don’t think there’s any book I’ve written where I have not had moments of just weeping. I’m a black American, and there is so much of our existence that has not been heard or recorded throughout the course of history. Knowing that I have the power to write something down, that it got recorded, for somebody’s pain to get seen, is overwhelming to me. EE: That really sums it up. I just have a sense of being attracted to a story, and then having to see it through as honestly as I can. That pain has to be experienced, and the reader has to work their way through it. You want the reader to feel as much as possible what it might have been like to be in a situation.You tackle slavery in your books. How do you approach these histories?EE: I think for a lot of people, we know about slavery in the abstract. We know what happened, and go on with life, when all these terrible things happened in the past. But they have real reverberations today. I started researching painful stories of these abuses and they were just so disgusting and brutal I really felt I needed to get that on the page.Though I don’t live with the iconography of slavery around me on the west coast of Canada, such a thing is certainly alive in the east of the country: slave-holding was practised in Quebec from 1629-1833, and of course Ontario was the final destination of the Underground Railroad. It’s important for me to acknowledge the roots of slavery here.There is a moment in both The Cutting Season and Washington Black when a character goes through dossiers, archives about slavery, and uncovers hidden truths about their family lineage. EE: I found that very striking – that there was almost the exact same scene in both books, that were so many years apart, in such different contexts, too. There is always that part of you that needs to know where you came from and needs to have a fuller sense of your history. My parents were immigrants and we lived in a bubble. We didn’t really have contact with my extended family. And I always felt like that was OK. That’s just how it was for me. My mother passed away in 1997, and we ended up making a big trip back to Ghana in 2007. I had never been before. Meeting my mother’s family was such an emotional experience, I spent two weeks just crying. Looking into the face of my last surviving grandparent, my father’s mother who was more than 100 years old, just seeing her and having this connection with her – I felt this sense of familiarity and deep fulfilment. And I didn’t know that I needed that.The Cutting Season features a re-creation of a southern plantation in the present day, with actors making an hourly wage to act as slaves for tourists ... AL: This was not something that sprang completely from my imagination. I went to a wedding at one of these places, in 2004, on a plantation outside New Orleans. I realised that this is going on all over the American south. I had read an article about a plantation in Georgia where the slave actors wanted to go on strike and it was so hilarious to me – the absurdity of trying to do these historical reenactments. So I was having fun with it, but I was also trying to talk about who gets to own history, and who gets to present and commodify it. I was making the parallel between immigrant labour and slavery. Once I knew I had to write about it, I went back to the plantation where I’d gone to the wedding and stayed there overnight.EE: So was there any kind of acknowledgement of what this place had been previously?AL: Well, at that time, they had taken down all of the slave cabins. They did have a very big plaque with the names of every slave that was ever there and what they cost. But other than that, they did tours where they talked about the drapes and china, and there was a gift shop, an ice cream store and a restaurant. It is a plantation business. What blew my mind is the irony that the people who are maintaining the grounds of this reenactment of history are now all Latino, and the people who are in the sugarcane fields are all immigrants from Guatemala and El Salvador and Mexico. So I was like, “Oh, y’all just did a different shade of brown. This is the same story.” And that’s when I realised I wanted my story to parallel the ways in which brown bodies had been used to hold up American economies without those people being able to participate as full citizens, which is essentially the same as where we are now.Attica, you’re working with Ava DuVernay as one of the writers for the upcoming TV series based on the infamous Central Park Five case, telling the stories of five teenagers of colour who were wrongly convicted of raping a woman jogging in New York City.AL: Yes, I’d never done that before. I’m in the writers’ room. I came in having done research and we keep researching, huge dossiers of the trial, police, every newspaper article, every TV news story about it. And we met all five of the men. They came one by one, not together, because we wanted to have inidual time with them. So over five days, we sat with each man for almost six hours. That was a gift for me. I wrote the trial episode, and I love law. My husband is a public defender my dad’s a lawyer, too. I write about legal stuff, so I was so happy to do that, it feels like the greatest use of my talent. If I get people to understand what they did to these kids then I have really done something with my life. EE: I wanted to ask you about Bluebird, Bluebird. I thought it was so fascinating that you chose to write about an African American cop.AL: See, I was never going to write a cop. I was firm on that. I don’t like writing people from the point of view of the establishment. But I read a book called Ghettoside, which is a look at crime in south LA. The premise of the book is that we spend so much time talking about the overpolicing of black life that we’re missing a conversation about the underpolicing of crimes against black life. The country was actually founded on not prosecuting crimes against black bodies. That’s what this country is. And that one black cop in Ghettoside, we believe he lives in south LA, basically before Black Lives Matter existed. He chose to live here with folks who looked like him and fought to protect them. So that allowed me access into an idea of a black cop. His uncertainty is the fuel that makes the book go. And he is a beautiful character for that uncertainty and ambiguity and ambivalence.In Washington Black, there is a lot of brutality lurking in the characters.EE: When I was researching Washington Black I read historical accounts of people who would come to the plantations in the Caribbean – visitors coming for a nice warm-weather holiday from England – and would sit down for dinner and then hear screaming coming from outside and just be shocked and horrified. But the people who had been living on the plantation for years would just be casually eating – it’s just part of the landscape, like birdsong or something. I think as human beings we can get to these places inside ourselves where we stop seeing just how awful something is, because we have become used to it it becomes ingrained in our landscapes. It’s frightening – the idea that everybody has the capacity within them to be hardened against human suffering. And that’s something that we have to guard against, even on a much smaller scale with everyday cruelties. You don’t want those to become part of the political and social landscape. You don’t want to become used to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6c859bf99c6565c5763311c5f417d403b12dfe/0_173_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1860402b0d17e60b4af13289afdd7b00","title":"corbynistas politics labour leader","story":"Labour’s leader should ignore mawkish messages of support and stop seeing inflexibility as a virtueThe trouble with spending much of the week watching the online campaign to free Tommy Robinson, as I did, is that you then can’t stop seeing it. There’s such a distinctive style to these messages of support, collated under the #FreeTommy hashtag. Mawkish, rather wallowing in victimhood, and frequently cultish. But there is more to the shtick than a cocktail of self-righteousness and triteness. It is, in that 1960s coinage of the American historian Richard Hofstadter, “the paranoid style”. Running through vast proportions of the online outpourings is an over-emotional conspiracism. People are afraid of us. People are trying to silence us. People will do anything to crush our leader. The idea that their leader could have got something wrong is a plot.Still, don’t take my word for it – take theirs. “A hero in the lion’s den” “the establishment can’t control him and they can’t unmake him” “a voice for the voiceless” “see us rise MSM – you will not win” “they can’t crush him” “you sound scared. You have for a long time. Change can be daunting for the heavily indoctrinated” “I have his back because he has mine” “time to stand up to the establishment. Stand up to the media” “we’re coming for it, all of it, and they are powerless against us”. And the inevitable variations on “I’m actually feeling quite emotional reading through all the tweets.”Actually, you must forgive me – because I’ve done something faintly mischievous there. In fact, none of the above is from #FreeTommy, but are instead sentiments from a different hashtag that sprang up on Thursday: an online campaign called #WeAreCorbyn, designed to show passionate solidarity with the Labour leader in the wake of his latest self-inflicted antisemitism row. (I realise many will not forgive me for seeing the similarities, and frothingly angry people from both campaigns are thanked in advance for their always amusing correspondence.)As I say, a lot of these share a distinctive, and in this sense interchangeable, style. Over to the genuine #FreeTommy ones now. “You may have tried to silence us, but we will prevail” “they can’t silence all of us” “we’ve got your back” “the establishment is afraid of us” “we shouldn’t be afraid of them – they should fear us” “the government should be scared of us” “I am proud and stand with you”. And the inevitable variations on “Feeling emotional reading all these”.Before we go on, I should stress that I am not here to liken Jeremy Corbyn to a far-right rabble rouser – even though his bespoke antisemitism definition defends the principle of being able to compare pretty much anyone with Nazis. Look, I’m genuinely glad he’s worrying about inflation – and he’s hardly the first guy in history to shout about it at rallies.I’m kidding. I’m honestly kidding. Unwisely so, given my experience of many Corbyn fans, who love it when you take the piss out of the Tories week after week, but get angrier over jokes about Jeremy than they do about seemingly anything else. So perhaps we’ll leave this blasphemous facetiousness there.In many ways, certain similarities between various modern tribes should not be a surprise. These are troubled times. People are searching for heroes they can believe in, on either side of the political ide – as they have in previous eras of note. In his excellent and mind-opening book, How Democracy Ends, David Runciman discourages the knee-jerk historical reference of our times – the idea that this or that is most redolent of the 1930s.Instead, those looking at contemporary politics and searching for historical parallels are directed toward the 1890s. Taking the example of the US, Runciman cites an economic crash, rapid disruption in ways of working caused by new technologies, uneven distribution of the benefits to such things, with most people seeeing their incomes fall, but a very few getting wildly rich, and so on. Into these currents come figures such as William Jennings Bryan, who won the Democratic nomination in 1896. Bryan was unconventional, he bypassed what we now call the mainstream media in favour of face-to-face interaction with voters and his own pamphleteering, he felt ordinary Americans had been ensnared by big finance. As for who was to blame, there were various culprits, “particularly bankers in the City of London with names like Rothschild …”Ah yes. Well, you do get a bit of that with a lot of these movements, don’t you often on the fringes, sometimes more centrally. As Hofstadter explicitly stated more than 50 years ago, the paranoid style is “far from new and not necessarily rightwing … It is the use of paranoid modes of expression by more or less normal people that makes the phenomenon significant.”I do not know whether Labour NEC member Peter Willsman is more or less normal, but the leaked recording of his rant about Jewish “Trump fanatics” certainly falls into the paranoid style. Yet the recording shows Corbyn staying deafeningly silent. Perhaps he prefers his Jewish\u0026nbspsupporters to own these things for him, which is a funny form of leadership. They shouldn’t have to. As for suggestions that Corbyn might make a conciliatory speech at the Jewish Museum in London, my favourite detail was the initial suggestion it would happen on Friday night. Oh man … Friday night. Any Jews got anything on?Filling the vacuum, meanwhile, others point out that Corbyn’s perceived version of antisemitism has over the past couple of years been endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan chief David Duke, former BNP leader Nick Griffin, the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer ... these should be an alarm bell. I’ll lay various plots against Corbyn at the door of “the establishment”, but not those. I wonder if Corbyn has ever thought to himself: “I am in the worrying position of being endorsed by some thermonuclear horrors on my handling of this issue.” If he hasn’t, he is a weaker man than many assume.The prevalent view among many close to him is that relentless media attacks have left his supporters feeling under siege. But which siege? There are sieges and sieges. It’s fair to say this current one isn’t Masada. This has been one of those weeks in the Labour leadership where it’s all felt a bit Waco.As always trumpeted, inflexibility is Corbyn’s USP. Yet it does not always connote strength. If he truly wants to govern for the many and not the few, he should consider the possibility that he is sometimes wrong, and horribly so.A fundamentalist belief in one’s own moral probity is what did for Tony Blair, and what allows the likes of Robinson to think they know better than the law. Corbyn won’t start some messianic war, or collapse a trial, obviously – but he will make a messianically blinkered mistake on something else big and important. People who think they’re right about everything – and that they always have been – always do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405d48bb303636a3dfef1381d3be7685e774f0b5/16_236_3887_2332/master/3887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93136da3cbf293dc64d127ac3a524692","title":"far right bbc lbc itv media","story":"The far right is on the march, and it is being legitimised and enabled by parts of the mainstream media. The shambolic interview of Raheem Kassam – sidekick to Steve Bannon and Nigel Farage – by the BBC’s flagship Today programme was a striking case in point. This champion of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (or as he calls himself, Tommy Robinson) – a man whose convictions include fraud, assault and contempt of court – was allowed to present himself as a legal expert. His link to the far-right Breitbart website was not mentioned.His claim that there was “nothing far-right about us” was not challenged, despite his sympathy for banning Muslim immigration, or his response to Sheffield’s lord mayor banning Donald Trump from the city: “What is it with these Muslim mayors that as soon as they get power they start acting like fascists? Oh right yeah sorry that’s Islam …” There was no attempt to refute his farcical claim that the Mussolini-praising Bannon was a “Kennedy Democrat”. His past vile statements were not put to him, like: “Can someone just like … tape Nicola Sturgeon’s mouth shut? And her legs, so she can’t reproduce. Thanks.” His repeated use of the term “cultural Marxism” – a far-right trope with antisemitic roots – or description of trans people as “trannies” was not mentioned. The interview was a travesty, another step further down the road of far-right normalisation.It’s not just the BBC, of course. Piers Morgan, a preening disgraced former newspaper editor reinvented as a fawning cheerleader for the Nazi-condoning, alleged sexual predator in the White House, conducted a toadying interview with Bannon on ITV. By way of contrast, Morgan hectored and shouted over leftwing Muslim writer Ash Sarkar. LBC allowed Farage – a personal friend of Trump – to softball interview ex-Trump aide Bannon: he used the slot to call for middle England to “rise up” and declare “this is war”. The reality is that the broadcast media more aggressively interrogates the opposition and its allies than it does fascists.Then there’s the utter failure of the BBC and other broadcasters to scrutinise the growing influence of the far right. Where are the national headlines about Bannon allegedly liaising with key Tory figures such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg? Where are the questions over US funding being ploughed into the rising British far right, not least funnelled through the Middle East Forum thinktank? With anti-Muslim hatred helping to fuel the rise of the far right, where are the stories about Islamophobia in the Tories, which Lady Sayeeda Warsi says poisons every level of the party, including the “extreme views” of Gove?The ascendant far right is, in part, the creation of a rightwing press that has spent years spewing venom about Muslims and immigrants. Farage would be nothing without the BBC: academic research suggests media coverage drove support for Ukip. With Yaxley-Lennon out of prison, the far right has its Oswald Mosley figure and is at its strongest across the western world since the 1930s. If significant parts of the media continues to normalise and mainstream the far-right menace, it is up to the rest of us to defeat it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89370be708ba4bb8dac3906f011ab516b4ddc0d0/0_66_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7de8699b78fa38264436ad546a6c50c4","title":"frank field labour mp brexit birkenhead","story":"To follow the career and pronouncements of Frank Field is to guarantee a lifetime of banging your head against the nearest table in abject misery. Field, Birkenhead’s indefatigable representative for almost 40 years, was one of four Labour MPs who voted last month with the government to prevent Britain joining a post-EU customs union, on the grounds that working-class voters “gave politicians a clear instruction to take the country out of the EU”. Every last one of them, apparently, yelling, “The only Brexit is hard Brexit” as they left the polling station.Now Field has been subject to a vote of no confidence by his constituency Labour members, it’s about time his obsessions – with immigration, with working-class respectability, and with meting out punishment to those on the margins of society – were held up to greater scrutiny. He has made a name for himself as an “independent thinker”, when the reality is his views and his party membership are essentially incompatible.I’m hesitant about mandatory reselection of MPs, given that every time the party’s pendulum swings from left to right and back, everyone who doesn’t slot in neatly will be more likely to be slung out. But Field’s views are so clearly inimical to Labour principles of justice, humanity and acceptance that in his case it’s reasonable to ask whether he should still be representing Labour voters in parliament.Since the Blair era, Labour has suffered a lack of confidence in applying those principles, adhering rigidly to the belief that voters in working-class constituencies are socially conservative with authoritarian leanings, and preferring to tack to the right than to offer genuine alternatives.Field does not lack confidence: he really does think there’s no alternative. He has campaigned to have constituents who engage in antisocial behaviour housed in metal containers under the M53 motorway. He has complained that “We still haven’t really taken the gloves off” to confront “neighbours from hell” and frequently makes distinctions in his own constituency between “toerags” and “decent hardworking taxpayers”, with only the latter deserving fair treatment.This is in the context of Birkenhead – a Merseyside town that has lost nearly half of its population since the 1950s, and was recently classed as the fourth-worst place to earn a living in the UK in part because of low earnings and business closures. The idea that Birkenhead might be shorter than other places on “decent hardworking taxpayers” might have something to do with there not being enough jobs to work hard at and pay tax.For a long time it was possible to see Field’s authoritarian worldview as part of a left-right continuum in Labour’s internal politics, with Field representing a strongly held “traditional” view of, for instance, working-class family and neighbourhood life (which wasn’t so much traditional as imposed by prevailing middle-class norms and, in any case, virtually impossible to achieve in conditions of extreme poverty).When New Labour entered power in 1997, he was tasked with “thinking the unthinkable” on welfare reform because he had, according to his own website, “led the campaign to make the Labour party electable” after 1979. As well as that self-styled “campaign”, before entering parliament he headed the Child Poverty Action Group and the Low Pay Unit in the 1970s, during which time he developed a specific and obsessive image of who “real” working-class people were – revealing, by definition, who are not.For Field, the line between respectability and its lack, and deserving and undeserving, is sacrosanct. The emphasis in his many statements on working-class respectability always comes down to self-reliance and mutual interdependence within strict local boundaries. He views the universal benefits offered by the postwar welfare state as having corrupted this ideal by offering assistance as a right rather than a conditional reward. Immigration he views solely through the prism of its perceived effects on “the white working class”.As with many other Labour MPs who frame their obsession with immigration as simply representing the views of “real working-class people”, he happens to represent a constituency with little recent immigration (although, of course, it was built on generations of inward migration from Ireland). No matter what Field suggests, EU membership has not driven down living standards and pay rates in places such as Birkenhead, which is in the state it’s in because of actions taken – and not taken – by British governments, the current one of which he seems determined to support.His supporters in Merseyside and beyond will point to his tireless opposition to universal credit and the fact that, in places where the scheme was piloted (Birkenhead included), its introduction has made people destitute. He has set up the Feeding Britain charity with fellow Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck to ensure children in constituencies such as theirs are fed all year round. Yet he campaigns against child poverty and family suffering while, with his other hand, brandishing a stick to anyone who, in his view, doesn’t come up to scratch.That puts him not on the “sane left”, as I suspect he would put it, but on the hard right. Labour is within reach of winning an election not by pandering to social conservatism but by pointing out, calmly and optimistically, that we are not living in the past. Even Field himself thought, “God, what am I doing in this party?” in 2015, when he couldn’t get Ed Miliband to agree with him on immigration.

It is summer, distilled into an oversized glass. I write this knowing absolutely nothing whatsoever about wine, but I don’t think that matters because the point of rosé is that it is wine for people who don’t know their way around a wine list. To choose a white or a red wine you need to know about grapes and vineyards and climates. To choose a rosé, you just ask for the palest one they’ve got, right?A wine you choose by the colour is a lifestyle choice, not a oenological one. Rosé pink – the liquid kind, not the flower kind – is part of our summer aesthetic. So it makes perfect sense that not only do we drink rosé in the summer, we also dress to match. Rose is nothing new, as a summer colour – we were wearing rose dresses back when a rose was something you grew in a flowerbed rather than poured from a bottle of Whispering Angel – but it’s a bit cooler now that it’s what millennials drink on their balconies rather than what baby boomers grow in their gardens.Choosing rose to wear, just like choosing rosé to drink, depends on getting the shade just right. Too lurid a pink translates as too sugary a taste. This is true on the eye, as well as on the tongue. The shade you want is in the region of the subtle blush that you would drink over a long lunch under the shade of a tree in, say, Provence, as opposed to the diluted-Ribena shade you find on the shelves of a basic off-licence for £6.99. Or, if you prefer to think in petals, the colour of a charming old rose from a David Austin catalogue rather than the toxic pink of forecourt flowers.I have worn a lot of pink over this summer’s heatwave. I think this is because I am wearing longer, looser clothes than I used to in hot weather. It’s not a modesty thing, or even an age thing, or at least not consciously I just find that these days I feel more comfortable, less exposed, better able to take the heat in my stride, when I’ve got a long hemline and a floaty sleeve. But floor-length black looks slightly alarming for daytime white is a bit ghostly yellow is hard work. Rose, on the other hand, works well when there’s lots of it. Just like rosé, then.

I’ll just say that as soon I was made aware of it, I ensured we put an end to it – and I give my word that on any project my team and I are involved in, we will take every precaution to make sure something similar does not take place again. I’m engaging in conversations to make sure I find the best way to do that. It’s on me to be proactive. Reacting isn’t enough.”Good Boys, directed by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, features Room’s Jacob Tremblay as one of a group of kids who skip school in a comedy described as “Stand By Me meets Superbad”.

At which point there might be the first pang.Yes! He really is gone, the thin white duke with his furrowed frown, the touching way his trousers flap just short of his shoes as he strides toward the touchline, utterly baffled by the sight of the same thing that always happens to his team happening to his team once again. For a moment your heart will start to swell at the Wenger-shaped absence. And then, just as abruptly, it will stop swelling. And you’ll be totally fine. Because let’s face it, it’s actually a huge relief it’s all over.And things have already changed. For the first time in a while, to think about Arsenal in August is to feel notes of intrigue, hope and enjoyable uncertainty. The fate of those who have followed an era-ning manager suggests history is against Unai Emery. But Emery has one major advantage over Arsène Wenger. Mainly he isn’t Arsène Wenger but is instead a manager whose methods and structures are entirely opposed to those of his predecessor.The chief distinction is that he actually has methods and structures. The word from the training ground is Arsenal’s players have been working furiously at playing without the ball. Rugged, useful additions have arrived. There is talk of Emery’s fetish for video analysis, his agreeably dull and technical press conferences. And so the necessary process of moving on has begun. The cultural revolution will in time kick over the Wenger traces, strip the quilted gowns from the club shop mannequins, dynamite the giant stone Wenger heads from the hillsides.As far as this summer goes the remaining note of intrigue is perhaps the most significant. Yes, it’s time to talk about Aaron. “I want him to be with us, but ...” Emery said this week, asked about Aaron Ramsey’s still unsigned contract. Arsenal fans want Ramsey to stay, although a few have whispered about cashing in, floating the brutal punkishness of taking down the definitive monument to the years of post-Highbury Wenger-ism.There are other candidates for the role of defining late Wenger-era player. Theo Walcott is a popular choice. Even now Walcott remains a baffling mix of extreme attributes and extended periods of basically doing nothing, a player who towards the end of his time at Arsenal sported the hair and beard of someone who doesn’t play any sport at all, resembling instead a charismatic regional paper clip sales manager who, yes, wants to talk to you about paper clips but also about human potential and the power of the mind.But for me it’s Ramsey, a footballer of far greater depth and interest and Arsenal’s best midfielder of the past five years. Is there a more frustratingly semi-explored high-end midfield talent in Britain? He remains a puzzle aged 27, a player who runs more than anyone else but at times can still seem oddly static, a midfielder who basically has everything, on the days when he has everything. Ramsey is all about the brilliantly smooth-surging sixth-minute late-running ink-finish opener in a three-goal first half against mid-ranking opposition on a Premier League October afternoon. But he also stinks of the 3-0 early April defeat at home to Chelsea as some weirdly staffed late-Wenger Arsenal simply fall apart under pressure like a cracked teapot. He’s one of the best late Wenger-era players. But at times he can also resemble a parody of a late-Wenger player, something distilled in a lab from hair of Hleb, essence of Bischoff and a tangle of old Silvinho toenails.Ramsey’s issue has probably been a lack of definition. José Mourinho has been criticised for setting a damagingly rigid set of demands on his creative players. Ramsey, who has known only Wenger since the age of 17, has seemed at times to have too much freedom, too few rules. On the worst days he has appeared to be wandering through an oddly frictionless midfield, a place of too little tension. In his best times as a No 8 or a No 10 there has been cover and balance. In that golden autumn of 2013 Ramsey had Mathieu Flamini glowering next to him.As ever the real point of interest here is about change and new things. Emery loves cover and balance and pressure in midfield. It remains to be seen if and how he can play Ramsey, Mesut Özil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan at the same time. You suspect Ramsey’s willingness not to move elsewhere but to stay, graft and take on a little of the Emery way will be key to his own success, and to the sense of taking on rather than simply rejecting the best of the Wenger years. It was Leonard Cohen who wrote about getting rid of tomorrow in his book Beautiful Losers. With a little luck Ramsey, and a little of the beauty, can still remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c78c0d6fe8cf47e2821ff1e9f50b9d869daf574/0_125_4844_2905/master/4844.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f742fd9ddca3c68e94f94d9abc88d1c9","title":"reading v derby county championship opener live","story":"Enjoyed this from Jacob Steinberg on Lampard’s thick skin, his smarts, and the importance of his assistant, Jody Morris.Let’s unpack these teams then. New summer recruits for Reading – Andy Yiadom and David Meyler – start with other new arrivals – John O’Shea, Sam Walker, Marc McNulty and this week’s signing Sam Baldock.Interestingly, there is no sign of Jack Marriott in the Derby squad. Loanees Mount and Harry Wilson, in from Liverpool, get the nod. It goes to show Derby’s strength in depth that they can have Bradley Johnson and Alex Pearce languishing on the bench. What Reading would do to have Pearce back, the Irishman made over 200 appearances for the Royals before his move to Derby in 2015. Matej Vydra – who failed to agree personal terms on a proposed £11m move to Leeds United – is yet to return to full fitness, as are Tom Huddlestone and George Thorne. So what have you been doing for the past 19 days? The void of summer, hot days spent trying to find a desk fan to precariously perch on your bedside table, hot nights spent rolling around in a puddle of your sweat after search for fan came to nothing. It’s been awful hasn’t it, with nothing to distract you but transfer gossip and Europa League qualifiers.But now, we have football, worth caring about. If Marcelo Bielsa believes the second tier of English football is too good for him, then it’s certainly good enough for you. Derby County, now led by Frank Lampard, are very much hoping that they will be in the top tier of English football by next May, and absolutely nobody – including Frank – has any idea whether they – or Frank – are good enough. It should be an intriguing story either way.For what it’s worth Derby have looked quite good in pre-season, winning four of their five matches, including eye-catching wins over Premier League opposition in Southampton and Wolves. The latter game was decided by Mason Mount, the preposterously talented Chelsea loanee, who impressed last season at Vitesse Arnhem, scoring nine times, providing eight assists, and winning the player of the year award. Just 19 years old, this could very easily be his breakthrough season in England. However, Lampard’s biggest summer coup could easily be Jack Marriott, the striker who arrived from Peterborough. If a reported fee of £5m is to be believed, that is an absolute snip. For all the optimism at Derby, Reading seems to be a club going backwards. They are widely tipped for a relegation struggle, with their best player, centre-back Liam Moore, reportedly wanting out. It did not seem that long ago that they were a force in this ision but a miserable 2017-18 has meant expectations are set firmly on survival. Paul Clement, formerly in the Derby dugout, won just two of his eight matches in charge since his appointment in March but that was enough for them to finish 20th.The thing about the Championship, though, is that it’s very unpredictable. Big money and big names don’t always prosper. Let’s see what happens tonight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfbbfeec4ffdfba1e43e4f90ce55f5df75c0e1d/0_1005_6550_3932/master/6550.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1054bc1a6ce14f941155ac651901bdc","title":"clare smyth worlds best female chef im not going to stand and shout at someone its just not nice","story":"She was once told by Gordon Ramsay she wouldn’t last a week in his kitchen. Now, the chef patron of Core in London has been named best female chef at the food industry’s ‘Oscars’. But why is the business still dominated by men?For reasons I\u0026nbsphave never fully understood, egomania in the kitchen has traditionally been rewarded with a\u0026nbspkind of monstrous glamour, making celebrities out of men whose management style in any other workplace would get them fired. For a\u0026nbspmild-mannered chef few of us had even heard of to be named the best in the world at the industry’s “Oscars” was, therefore, a\u0026nbspremarkable achievement. What made the accolade even more unusual was the widespread unease\u0026nbsp– acknowledged by the winner herself\u0026nbsp– about whether the prize should even\u0026nbspexist.Clare Smyth, chef patron of Core in west London, was named best female chef at the World’s 50 Best Restaurant awards gala in Bilbao in June, prompting other female chefs to object that the category was “ridiculous”, “outrageous”, “outdated” and “bizarre”. Some, however, pointed out that, when only four of the world’s 50 best restaurants are run by women, the industry has a\u0026nbspsexism problem, which the award recognises and seeks to mitigate. “If discriminating on gender can be a\u0026nbspstep towards gender-neutrality, why not?” argued one commentator. In her acceptance speech, Smyth expressed the view that “there is no right and wrong way to address this, but things won’t change if we do nothing”, while accepting that a\u0026nbspgender-specific category felt “strange”.It would be hard to imagine anyone less temperamentally suited to controversy than the tall, flawlessly composed figure in chef’s whites who greets me in her Notting Hill restaurant. Core has been open for less than a\u0026nbspyear and represents a\u0026nbspsynthesis of Smyth’s classical French training and British artisanal influence its tasting menu features dishes such as jellied eel with toasted seaweed and malt vinegar foie gras parfait with madeira jelly and smoked duck and Isle of Mull scallop tartare. The restaurant is closed on the day we meet, so we talk in the dining room, which is a\u0026nbspvision of understated elegance\u0026nbsp– cool blond wood, ambient lighting, crisp white linen\u0026nbsp– the quiet subtlety of its perfectionism appearing to channel the sensibility of its chef. Smyth, 39, left home\u0026nbsp– a\u0026nbspfarm in Northern Ireland\u0026nbsp– at 16 to train in England, worked under Heston Blumenthal and the Roux brothers, became the first woman to work in Gordon Ramsay’s kitchen and rose to be head chef at his Chelsea restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, picking up three Michelin stars and an MBE along the way.She chooses her words carefully and speaks softly, without any gesture or turn of phrase to animate or reveal her character. The almost glassy self-containment reminds me of the focus of a\u0026nbspprofessional athlete, as though dedication to her vocation has absorbed every ounce of\u0026nbspher.I am sure Smyth would happily talk about nothing but carrots and potatoes for the entire interview. On her “day off” in the week we meet, she had set off for Leeds at dawn to spend the day “digging potatoes out the soil, working with the agronomist, learning the history of them\u0026nbsp… everything about them: ‘You need to eat them within 24 hours, you need to get them to this temperature,’ and so on. There is so much science, history and everything in a\u0026nbsppotato.”She looks mesmerised by these obscure gastronomical details, but, of course, I’m more interested in her thoughts about the hoo-ha surrounding her prize. If she considered the category “strange”, did she have any misgivings about accepting the award, for fear that it would formalise female chefs’ status as\u0026nbspinferior?“When the food community votes for you and wants to give you something, it’s nice. So I\u0026nbspfelt: ‘Thank you very much.’ It’s about recognition,” she offers cautiously. “It’s definitely not an inferior category. I’ve not considered, and it doesn’t enter any of these people’s minds”\u0026nbsp– she gestures at her team in the kitchen\u0026nbsp– “that I’m a\u0026nbspwoman or a\u0026nbspman. It doesn’t and it never has\u0026nbspdone.”This consummately diplomatic answer doesn’t entirely square with what Smyth has said about gender in the past. I\u0026nbspquote back a\u0026nbspline from an interview she gave in 2008: “People say: ‘Isn’t she a\u0026nbspgood chef?’ and they mean: ‘For a\u0026nbspwoman.’ But I\u0026nbspwant to be a\u0026nbspgreat chef just because I\u0026nbspam one, not because I’m a\u0026nbspwoman.” Her former boss, Ramsay, memorably once said: “Women can’t cook to save their lives,” and, in 2007, Smyth revealed that, when she first joined his team, “there was a\u0026nbsphell of a\u0026nbsplot of testosterone in that kitchen. I\u0026nbspwas told I\u0026nbspwouldn’t last a\u0026nbspweek\u0026nbsp– Gordon even said that. There were people saying: ‘It’s not for girls you shouldn’t be here.’ It took me a\u0026nbsplong time to earn respect. I\u0026nbsphad to work twice as hard. I\u0026nbspcould never say I\u0026nbspwas tired or I was sick or I had cut my finger because the response would have been: ‘It’s because you’re a\u0026nbspgirl.’” A gender-blind kitchen may be logical in theory, but, from the sound of it, it is far harder in\u0026nbsppractice.According to Smyth, 11 years later, though, it can and does exist. “When I\u0026nbspstarted out, yes, generally those kitchens at that time were very testosterone-driven places. Traditional kitchens at the top level were always very tough: long hours with poor staff meals. Those days were very much like that, but thankfully we approach human resources in a\u0026nbspvery different way now.” The cliche of the volcanic-tempered chef is, she says, laughably out of date. “The approach we take more now is trying to inspire, rather than rule by\u0026nbspfear.”Smyth describes today’s kitchen culture as one of courteous civility. It sounds so unlikely that, at first, I\u0026nbspassume she must be making it up. Aggressive control freakery has long been part of the mythology of the great chef and, having interviewed several over the years, I\u0026nbspcan confirm that there is more than a\u0026nbsplittle truth in it. But it becomes increasingly clear that Smyth is unlike any other chef I\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspmet.When I\u0026nbspask how often she shouts in the kitchen, she looks bemused. “Not very often. I’m always very calm and chilled. Rather than screaming and shouting at someone who is not capable of doing something, we will just very gently coach them into another role. We may even help them find a\u0026nbspjob somewhere else. But I’m not going to stand and shout and abuse someone because that’s not what I’m there for. It’s just not nice, you know, and it’s just not good for anyone. We try to look at problems in a\u0026nbspmuch more, let’s say, professional light, with a\u0026nbspmore adult way of dealing with\u0026nbspthings.”It doesn’t sound as if she feels a\u0026nbspneed to exercise tight control. “Oh, but we do,” she corrects me. “Because of training.” Her restaurant operates a\u0026nbspde facto internal academy, running a\u0026nbspweekly training day when kitchen staff are given projects to research\u0026nbsp– which they present to the whole team\u0026nbsp– and a\u0026nbspdaily training session before each service, when a\u0026nbspstaff member prepares notes and briefs the team on a\u0026nbspparticular wine or dish. Is that normal practice for restaurants? “Er, no. But we give people the tools to be able to do their inidual jobs properly, with confidence. That’s a\u0026nbsphuge part of what we do. That’s why, although we say we don’t have the control, we probably have more because our team really know their\u0026nbspsubjects.”She is equally happy to devolve power to her customers\u0026nbsp– or guests, as she calls them. Core does not operate a\u0026nbspdress code for diners, unlike Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. “People who were quite formal there will come to Core and they’ll have trainers on and I’m like: ‘Oh! You’re actually not that person. If you choose how you dress to come to a\u0026nbspfine-dining restaurant, you wear trainers.’ I\u0026nbsplove that. I\u0026nbsplove to see people\u0026nbsp– who they are, what they choose to\u0026nbspbe.”There is no salt and pepper on Core’s tables, but if guests request it she’s happy to provide some. I\u0026nbspask if she winces if someone orders the “wrong” wine, but she shakes her head firmly. “No, not at all. As long as people have what they want, that’s our job. If someone wants their meat cooked well done, whatever they feel comfortable with is fine by us. My mum might want her beef well done. It’s not up to us to dictate how they wish to eat. We just want people to have what they feel comfortable with\u0026nbsp– because the worst thing is coming to a\u0026nbsprestaurant and not feeling comfortable. If I\u0026nbspwere to take my sister or my mum or my aunt, I\u0026nbspwouldn’t want to sit uncomfortably in a\u0026nbspdining room because they want well-done meat or salt and pepper. No, that’s what we’re here for. We’re here to take care of\u0026nbsppeople.”Smyth looks a\u0026nbsplittle bashful when I\u0026nbspask about her own work-life balance and admits to working an 80-hour week. “But I\u0026nbspwouldn’t rather be in the pub tonight, for example. I’d rather be here. For me, this isn’t work.” Given her devotion to the job, I’m curious about why she’s not more famous. Does a\u0026nbspcooking show on TV not appeal? She looks aghast.“Not at all. Not at all. That isn’t something that inspires me, certainly not at this point in my career. Working with food, produce, nature\u0026nbsp– that’s what gets me excited. I’m not a\u0026nbsptelevision-studio kind of\u0026nbspperson.”She catered for the royal wedding reception earlier this year, but grows coy when I\u0026nbspbring it up. Beyond the fact that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had previously dined at Core, she gives nothing away and affects a\u0026nbspsurprising insouciance about being the royal couple’s choice. The trouble with outside catering jobs, she explains, is that she has to close the restaurant for the day. “And we’re, um, quite busy,” she\u0026nbspmurmurs.What an understatement this is becomes clear when I\u0026nbspask how long I\u0026nbspwould have to wait for a\u0026nbsptable for four on a Friday. “September?” Presumably, though, if I\u0026nbspcalled that afternoon to make a\u0026nbspbooking for the Beckhams and Oprah Winfrey, one would magically become available, wouldn’t it? She looks at me as if I\u0026nbspmust be\u0026nbspmad.“But we couldn’t do it. We don’t have the table.” She can’t be serious, can she? “Oh, yes. We couldn’t do it. We’re full and we’re not going to just phone up the people who booked table five and tell them: ‘You’re not coming.’ It just wouldn’t be\u0026nbspfair.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f5fe06d84b78525f290fef92b26b99a80cde762/0_306_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=149b34cf5e32cd35d9341d4590db3a31","title":"how to eat magnums ice cream on stick","story":"The ice-creams on a stick – and their supermarket doppelgangers – are restorative in the hot weather. But do you lick it or bite it? And can you make yours last for 30 minutes? How to Eat is in no doubt about who its favourite Bond is. It has to be Roger Moore. Not for his work in the field of arched eyebrows and the perpetuation of xenophobic cliches about eastern European supervillains, but for his mysterious role in helping invent the Magnum ice-cream.Thus, Moore may – possibly, who knows, but let’s go with it – have inspired the creation of a lolly that, since its launch in Germany in 1989 (and you thought the wall coming down was that year’s big Berlin story), has gone on to become the world’s biggest single ice-cream brand, worth £2bn globally in 2015. That revenue is little surprise, given the enthusiasm with which Unilever has launched endless Magnum variations and spin-offs: minis, bites, crackable chocolate-coated ice-cream tubs, chocolate bars and thins. It is working hard to maintain its brand-cachet over a host of cheaper imitators known in the trade as “ice-cream sticks”. For the sake of simplicity, though, we will stick to calling them Magnums in this column.Historically, the Magnum – boxed, expensive, so rich you could only manage one – was a rare treat a Saturday night dessert unveiled when there was something special to celebrate. However, the emergence of cut-price supermarket doppelgangers of the classic Magnum (Asda’s Moments, Sainsbury’s Indulgence, Iceland’s 4-for-£1 Majestics etc), has turned the Belgian chocolate-covered vanilla ice-cream stick into, if not an everyday pleasure, then a regular one. True, in some cases, the supermarket Magnums may lack a little razzle-dazzle. The chocolate may be thinner than on the real thing, or the ice-cream may lack that hallmark luxurious density. But, often, that deficit is marginal. Moreover, as regular HTE readers will know, there is no such thing as objectively bad ice-cream. There are just different grades of ice-cream to be enjoyed at different times, depending on what you can afford.If the classic Magnum moment is still after tea, as a treat (give it 30 minutes, let your tea settle, you cannot be too full or it will make you nauseous), it is nonetheless a godsend that Magnums are now an affordable indulgence at other crucial moments. For instance, when you crawl from your pit some time after 11am, weak and queasy, incapacitated by a 360° physical and existential hangover, a cooling Magnum is a balm for the body and soul. It provides the sugar you crave and its fundamentally childish flavours evoke a more innocent time. A time that, yes, with a little discipline and different friends, you could return to. Similarly, in a heatwave, when you are all hot and bothered, baking in dry heat or wading through the clammy claustrophobia of the city, taking a moment out with a Magnum is restorative. Not because this is a refreshing ice lolly. It is not. But in the intensity of that few minutes, that period of pleasure, you transcend the corporeal world. You forget the heat, the sweat trickling down your back. You forget yourself.The “where” is less important than your posture. You need to work with a Magnum to get the most out of it. You need to be both fully focused on the task in hand, but able to move your head and arms freely. Therefore, you need to be sitting down. Not lying down. And not walking, unless, in this distracted state, you are happy to lose half that chocolate coating to the pavement.Ideally, all this will be done alone. Do not talk to someone while they are in the Magnum zone. Short of, “Did you know your left leg is on fire?”, nothing you have to say is important enough to warrant disturbing the serene peace of that moment.If you look at the ingredients, most of the chocolate found in everyday ice-cream is actually a “chocolatey” or “chocolate-flavoured” substance. It is a lab-engineered variant on chocolate used because, ordinarily, freezing causes the fatty acids in chocolate to become powdery and gritty. But the chocolate on Magnums is real chocolate. The Belgian producer Callebaut designed it for Unilever, deliberately to withstand minus 40C temperatures while retaining its traditional characteristics. Therefore, it is something to savour. HTE has read of people who can make a Magnum last for 30 minutes. That is a feat of tantric consumption it can only admire, awestruck. But certainly, you want to string this out for as long as possible. Think of a Magnum as two courses. Begin not by savagely biting into it (note: if you do, the chocolate shell will shatter the Magnum is designed to nudge people away from biting). Instead, use your front teeth to prise off all the chocolate. Start – and this is important – along the right-hand edge of the Magnum, at the bottom, near the stick. Hold it just above your mouth, tilting it towards your face slightly, holding it diagonally so it points away over your left cheek. This way, if any pieces break off or are left hanging from the ice-cream centre, you are perfectly positioned to catch them as they fall, or nibble them away before they do. From the sides, then move on to the Magnum’s wide fascias, where you can lever off larger pieces of thick chocolate. HTE is aware of people – prissy, uptight people – who awkwardly fold the wrapper back around the stick to avoid any stickiness on their fingers, andor eat them over plates to catch any falling chocolate. HTE says: recline gently, live a little, but don’t wear a brand new T-shirt.Once the chocolate has been painstakingly removed, it is time to eat the ice-cream. Again, do not bite. Do not suck at it like a toddler. Do not lick even. Instead, working from the tip down, put a comfortable amount of Magnum in your mouth and then gently pull it out, allowing your lips to shear a few millimetres of ice-cream away from the surface. And repeat. Continue down to the stick.Note: these instructions apply only to the classic – and by far the best – milk chocolate Magnum. The nutty versions, where the smooth, velvety texture of the chocolate is interrupted, are far less enjoyable, while those with a sauce (eg salted caramel) injected under the surface of the chocolate are impossible to eat in this preferred lingering fashion. Similarly, the Magnums with sauces swirled through them are curiously unsatisfying. That textural contrast, between the dense ice-cream and the almost jellified sauce, is so odd you cannot settle into the experience. If you cannot immediately bin the wrapper, you must, before eating, hold the Magnum in your mouth by the tip, using a gentle pressure from your lips, without biting into it – think of the animal kingdom and mothers carrying their newborn offspring in their jaws – and quickly, while holding the Magnum in your mouth, tie the packet in a knot. This takes practice, but it prevents any melting spillage from tiny remnants of chocolate or ice-cream that have clung to the interior of the packet.Once you have finished, that knotted packet is a convenient place to prop up the iconic paddle lolly stick without making a sticky mess on, say, a coffee table or the arm of the settee. You do not have to immediately move to find a bin. You can chill and enjoy the post-gustatory glow. The rule is your drink should be sweeter than your food, which is why ice-cream is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. As you will know if you have ever taken a swig of dry, fruity, acidic sauvignon blanc while eating a sugary dessert, that clash turns the wine into either a cacophonous jangle of sharp-elbowed flavours or a dull, flabby mess. If you need alcohol with your Magnum, pedro ximénez, the sweetest cousin in the sherry family – up to 450g of residual sugar per litre – will work far better. Although, that Venn diagram intersection of Magnum and craft beer fans, will no doubt prefer to go with a stout or porter with pronounced coffee or chocolate notes.So Magnums, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8e81aced00e85f25c534d720c20e304965eff8c/0_335_3515_2110/master/3515.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55ed64dd2fb19be144bc62d837c1e74f","title":"a colder splash ice swimming in austria in pictures","story":"While Europe swelters, members of the Austrian Ice Swimming Association spent three days in the Tyrol for training sessions in a kettle hole at the Nature ice palace inside the Hintertux glacier.

The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Based on Gillian Flynn’s zig-zagging bestseller, scenes in this HBO series are often powered by a soundtrack: after returning to her home town to cover a harrowing story, hard-drinking writer Camille (Amy Adams) finds solace, escape and sometimes violent release in songs cued up from a cracked, Led Zep-stacked iPod. It’s something she has harnessed since she was young. Music is now how she filters the world, having been schooled in rock by a troubled girl whom she met in care as a teen.In The A Word, we first meet autistic five-year-old Joe striding down a country road with headphones clamped on, belting out Arctic Monkeys’ Mardy Bum. Joe’s enthusiasm for modern indie floorfillers and 80s classics such as Orange Juice and the Human League is both infectious and believable. “Autism covers a huge variety of behaviours but music often features, perhaps because music is rule-governed,” says Hallam. “Engaging with the music and working out the rules within it can become almost an obsession. And the good thing about headphones is that they can also shut out other things.”Preceding these characters is one screen moppet who resisted her feckless father’s love of Grand Funk Railroad: the original kid with killer taste. Does an eight-year-old girl – let’s call her Lisa – being obsessed with Miles Davis and having a deep love of jazz despite an extremely chaotic home environment sound conceivable? “Broadly speaking, children are very open-eared and respond positively to a whole range of music, so being into jazz at eight is not necessarily unusual,” says Hallam. “Perhaps she was first exposed to it at the school band and the love came from there.” As ever, The Simpsons did it first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0444d480f970fc6f5bd698470a0665e4b7c7707/900_0_4190_2514/master/4190.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9e73c8100336760971634ae0be5a2eb","title":"denialism what drives people to reject the truth","story":"From vaccines to climate change to genocide, a new age of denialism is upon us. Why have we failed to understand it? By  Keith Kahn-HarrisWe are all in denial, some of the time at least. Part of being human, and living in a society with other humans, is finding clever ways to express – and conceal – our feelings. From the most sophisticated diplomatic language to the baldest lie, humans find ways to deceive. Deceptions are not necessarily malign at some level they are vital if humans are to live together with civility. As Richard Sennett has argued: “In practising social civility, you keep silent about things you know clearly but which you should not and do not say.”Just as we can suppress some aspects of ourselves in our self-presentation to others, so we can do the same to ourselves in acknowledging or not acknowledging what we desire. Most of the time, we spare ourselves from the torture of recognising our baser yearnings. But when does this necessary private self-deception become harmful? When it becomes public dogma. In other words: when it becomes denialism.Denialism is an expansion, an intensification, of denial. At root, denial and denialism are simply a subset of the many ways humans have developed to use language to deceive others and themselves. Denial can be as simple as refusing to accept that someone else is speaking truthfully. Denial can be as unfathomable as the multiple ways we avoid acknowledging our weaknesses and secret desires.Denialism is more than just another manifestation of the humdrum intricacies of our deceptions and self-deceptions. It represents the transformation of the everyday practice of denial into a whole new way of seeing the world and – most important – a collective accomplishment. Denial is furtive and routine denialism is combative and extraordinary. Denial hides from the truth, denialism builds a new and better truth.In recent years, the term has been used to describe a number of fields of “scholarship”, whose scholars engage in audacious projects to hold back, against seemingly insurmountable odds, the findings of an avalanche of research. They argue that the Holocaust (and other genocides) never happened, that anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is a myth, that Aids either does not exist or is unrelated to HIV, that evolution is a scientific impossibility, and that all manner of other scientific and historical orthodoxies must be rejected.In some ways, denialism is a terrible term. No one calls themselves a “denialist”, and no one signs up to all forms of denialism. In fact, denialism is founded on the assertion that it is not denialism. In the wake of Freud (or at least the vulgarisation of Freud), no one wants to be accused of being “in denial”, and labelling people denialists seems to compound the insult by implying that they have taken the private sickness of denial and turned it into public dogma.But denial and denialism are closely linked what humans do on a large scale is rooted in what we do on a small scale. While everyday denial can be harmful, it is also just a mundane way for humans to respond to the incredibly difficult challenge of living in a social world in which people lie, make mistakes and have desires that cannot be openly acknowledged. Denialism is rooted in human tendencies that are neither freakish nor pathological.All that said, there is no doubt that denialism is dangerous. In some cases, we can point to concrete examples of denialism causing actual harm. In South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki, in office between 1999 and 2008, was influenced by Aids denialists such as Peter Duesberg, who deny the link between HIV and Aids (or even HIV’s existence) and cast doubt on the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs. Mbeki’s reluctance to implement national treatment programmes using anti-retrovirals has been estimated to have cost the lives of 330,000 people. On a smaller scale, in early 2017 the Somali-American community in Minnesota was struck by a childhood measles outbreak, as a direct result of proponents of the discredited theory that the MMR vaccine causes autism, persuading parents not to vaccinate their children.More commonly though, denialism’s effects are less direct but more insidious. Climate change denialists have not managed to overturn the general scientific consensus that it is occurring and caused by human activity. What they have managed to do is provide subtle and not-so-subtle support for those opposed to taking radical action to address this urgent problem. Achieving a global agreement that could underpin a transition to a post-carbon economy, and that would be capable of slowing the temperature increase, was always going to be an enormous challenge. Climate change denialism has helped to make the challenge even harder.Denialism can also create an environment of hate and suspicion. Forms of genocide denialism are not just attempts to overthrow irrefutable historical facts they are an assault on those who survive genocide, and their descendants. The implacable denialism that has led the Turkish state to refuse to admit that the 1917 Armenian genocide occurred is also an attack on today’s Armenians, and on any other minority that would dare to raise troubling questions about the status of minorities in Turkey. Similarly, those who deny the Holocaust are not trying to disinterestedly “correct” the historical record they are, with varying degrees of subtlety, trying to show that Jews are pathological liars and fundamentally dangerous, as well as to rehabilitate the reputation of the Nazis.The dangers that other forms of denialism pose may be less concrete, but they are no less serious. Denial of evolution, for example, does not have an immediately hateful payoff rather it works to foster a distrust in science and research that feeds into other denialisms and undermines evidence-based policymaking. Even lunatic-fringe denialisms, such as flat Earth theories, while hard to take seriously, help to create an environment in which real scholarship and political attempts to engage with reality, break down in favour of an all-encompassing suspicion that nothing is what it seems.Denialism has moved from the fringes to the centre of public discourse, helped in part by new technology. As information becomes freer to access online, as “research” has been opened to anyone with a web browser, as previously marginal voices climb on to the online soapbox, so the opportunities for countering accepted truths multiply. No one can be entirely ostracised, marginalised and dismissed as a crank anymore.The sheer profusion of voices, the plurality of opinions, the cacophony of the controversy, are enough to make anyone doubt what they should believe.So how do you fight denialism? Denialism offers a dystopian vision of a world unmoored, in which nothing can be taken for granted and no one can be trusted. If you believe that you are being constantly lied to, paradoxically you may be in danger of accepting the untruths of others. Denialism is a mix of corrosive doubt and corrosive credulity.It’s perfectly understandable that denialism sparks anger and outrage, particularly in those who are directly challenged by it. If you are a Holocaust survivor, a historian, a climate scientist, a resident of a flood-plain, a geologist, an Aids researcher or someone whose child caught a preventable disease from an unvaccinated child, denialism can feel like an assault on your life’s work, your core beliefs or even your life itself. Such people do fight back. This can include, in some countries, supporting laws against denialism, as in France’s prohibition of Holocaust denial. Attempts to teach “creation science” alongside evolution in US schools are fought with tenacity. Denialists are routinely excluded from scholarly journals and academic conferences.The most common response to denialism, though, is debunking. Just as denialists produce a large and ever-growing body of books, articles, websites, lectures and videos, so their detractors respond with a literature of their own. Denialist claims are refuted point by point, in a spiralling contest in which no argument – however ludicrous – is ever left unchallenged. Some debunkings are endlessly patient and civil, treating denialists and their claims seriously and even respectfully others are angry and contemptuous.Yet none of these strategies work, at least not completely. Take the libel case that the Holocaust denier David Irving brought against Deborah Lipstadt in 1996. Irving’s claim that accusing him of being a Holocaust denier and a falsifier of history was libellous were forensically demolished by Richard Evans and other eminent historians. The judgment was devastating to Irving’s reputation and unambiguous in its rejection of his claim to be a legitimate historian. The judgment bankrupted him, he was repudiated by the few remaining mainstream historians who had supported him, and in 2006 he was imprisoned in Austria for Holocaust denial.But Irving today? He is still writing and lecturing, albeit in a more covert fashion. He still makes similar claims and his defenders see him as a heroic figure who survived the attempts of the Jewish-led establishment to silence him. Nothing really changed. Holocaust denial is still around, and its proponents find new followers. In legal and scholarly terms, Lipstadt won an absolute victory, but she didn’t beat Holocaust denial or even Irving in the long term.There is a salutary lesson here: in democratic societies at least, denialism cannot be beaten legally, or through debunking, or through attempts to discredit its proponents. That’s because, for denialists, the existence of denialism is itself a triumph. Central to denialism is an argument that “the truth” has been suppressed by its enemies. To continue to exist is a heroic act, a victory for the forces of truth.Of course, denialists might yearn for a more complete victory – when theories of anthropogenic climate change will be marginalised in academia and politics, when the story of how the Jews hoaxed the world will be in every history book – but, for now, every day that denialism persists is a good day. In fact, denialism can achieve more modest triumphs even without total victory. For the denialist, every day barrels of oil continue to be extracted and burned is a good day, every day a parent doesn’t vaccinate their child is a good day, every day a teenager Googling the Holocaust finds out that some people think it never happened is a good day.Conversely, denialism’s opponents rarely have time on their side. As climate change rushes towards the point of no return, as Holocaust survivors die and can no longer give testimony, as once-vanquished diseases threaten pandemics, as the notion that there is “doubt” on settled scholarship becomes unremarkable, so the task facing the debunkers becomes both more urgent and more difficult. It’s understandable that panic can set in and that anger overwhelms some of those who battle against denialism.A better approach to denialism is one of self-criticism. The starting point is a frank question: why did we fail? Why have those of us who abhor denialism not succeeded in halting its onward march? And why have we as a species managed to turn our everyday capacity to deny into an organised attempt to undermine our collective ability to understand the world and change it for the better?These questions are beginning to be asked in some circles. They are often the result of a kind of despair. Campaigners against anthropogenic global warming often lament that, as the task becomes ever more urgent, so denialism continues to run rampant (along with apathy and “softer” forms of denial). It appears that nothing works in the campaign to make humanity aware of the threat it faces.The obstinacy with which people can stick to disproved notions is attested to in the social sciences and in neuroscientific research. Humans are not only reasoning beings who disinterestedly weigh evidence and arguments. But there is a difference between the pre-conscious search for confirmation of existing views – we all engage in that to some extent – and the deliberate attempt to dress this search up as a quest for truth, as denialists do. Denialism adds extra layers of reinforcement and defence around widely shared psychological practices with the (never articulated) aim of preventing their exposure. This certainly makes changing the minds of denialists even more difficult than changing the minds of the rest of stubborn humanity.There are multiple kinds of denialists: from those who are sceptical of all established knowledge, to those who challenge one type of knowledge from those who actively contribute to the creation of denialist scholarship, to those who quietly consume it from those who burn with certainty, to those who are privately sceptical about their scepticism. What they all have in common, I would argue, is a particular type of desire. This desire – for something not to be true – is the driver of denialism.Empathy with denialists is not easy, but it is essential. Denialism is not stupidity, or ignorance, or mendacity, or psychological pathology. Nor is it the same as lying. Of course, denialists can be stupid, ignorant liars, but so can any of us. But denialists are people in a desperate predicament.It is a very modern predicament. Denialism is a post‑enlightenment phenomenon, a reaction to the “inconvenience” of many of the findings of modern scholarship. The discovery of evolution, for example, is inconvenient to those committed to a literalist biblical account of creation. Denialism is also a reaction to the inconvenience of the moral consensus that emerged in the post-enlightenment world. In the ancient world, you could erect a monument proudly proclaiming the genocide you committed to the world. In the modern world, mass killing, mass starvation, mass environmental catastrophe can no longer be publicly legitimated.Yet many humans still want to do the same things humans always did. We are still desiring beings. We want to murder, to steal, to destroy and to despoil. We want to preserve our ignorance and unquestioned faith. So when our desires are rendered unspeakable in the modern world, we are forced to pretend that we do not yearn for things we desire.Denial is not enough here. As an attempt to draw awareness and attention away from something unpalatable, it is always vulnerable to challenge. Denial is a kind of high-wire act that can be unbalanced by forceful attempts to draw attention to what is being denied.Denialism is, in part, a response to the vulnerability of denial. To be in denial is to know at some level. To be a denialist is to never have to know at all. Denialism is a systematic attempt to prevent challenge and acknowledgment to suggest that there is nothing to acknowledge. Whereas denial is at least subject to the possibility of confrontation with reality, denialism can rarely be undermined by appeals to face the truth.The tragedy for denialists is that they concede the argument in advance. Holocaust deniers’ attempts to deny that the Holocaust took place imply that it would not have been a good thing if it had. Climate change denialism is predicated on a similarly hidden acknowledgment that, if anthropogenic climate change were actually occurring, we would have to do something about it.Denialism is therefore not just hard work – finding ways to discredit mountains of evidence is a tremendous labour – but also involves suppressing the expression of one’s desires. Denialists are “trapped” into byzantine modes of argument because they have few other options in pursuing their goals.Denialism, and related phenomena, are often portrayed as a “war on science”. This is an understandable but profound misunderstanding. Certainly, denialism and other forms of pseudo-scholarship do not follow mainstream scientific methodologies. Denialism does indeed represent a perversion of the scholarly method, and the science it produces rests on profoundly erroneous assumptions, but denialism does all this in the name of science and scholarship. Denialism aims to replace one kind of science with another – it does not aim to replace science itself. In fact, denialism constitutes a tribute to the prestige of science and scholarship in the modern world. Denialists are desperate for the public validation that science affords.While denialism has sometimes been seen as part of a post-modern assault on truth, the denialist is just as invested in notions of scientific objectivity as the most unreconstructed positivist. Even those who are genuinely committed to alternatives to western rationality and science can wield denialist rhetoric that apes precisely the kind of scientism they despise. Anti-vaxxers, for example, sometimes seem to want to have their cake and eat it: to have their critique of western medicine validated by western medicine.The rhetoric of denialism and its critics can resemble each other in a kind of war to the death over who gets to wear the mantle of science. The term “junk science” has been applied to climate change denialism, as well as in defence of it. Mainstream science can also be dogmatic and blind to its own limitations. If the accusation that global warming is an example of politicised ideology masked as science is met with indignant assertions of the absolute objectivity of “real” science, there is a risk of blinding oneself to uncomfortable questions regarding the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which the idea of pure truth, untrammelled by human interests, is elusive. Human interests can rarely if ever be separated from the ways we observe the world. Indeed, sociologists of science have shown how modern ideas of disinterested scientific knowledge have disguised the inextricable links between knowledge and human interests.I do not believe that, if only one could find the key to “make them understand”, denialists would think just like me. A global warming denialist is not an environmentalist who cannot accept that he or she is really an environmentalist a Holocaust denier is not someone who cannot face the inescapable obligation to commemorate the Holocaust an Aids denialist is not an Aids activist who won’t acknowledge the necessity for western medicine in combating the disease and so on. If denialists were to stop denying, we cannot assume that we would then have a shared moral foundation on which we could make progress as a species.Denialism is not a barrier to acknowledging a common moral foundation it is a barrier to acknowledging moral differences. An end to denialism is therefore a disturbing prospect, as it would involve these moral differences revealing themselves directly. But we need to start preparing for that eventuality, because denialism is starting to break down – and not in a good way.On 6 November 2012, when he was already preparing the ground for his presidential run, Donald Trump sent a tweet about climate change. It said: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”At the time, this seemed to be just another example of the mainstreaming of climate change denialism on the American right. After all, the second Bush administration had done as little as possible to combat climate change, and many leading Republicans are prominent crusaders against mainstream climate science. Yet something else was happening here, too the tweet was a harbinger of a new kind of post-denialist discourse.Trump’s claim is not one that is regularly made by “mainstream” global warming denialists. It may have been a garbled version of the common argument on the US right that global climate treaties will unfairly weaken the US economy to the benefit of China. Like much of Trump’s discourse, the tweet was simply thrown into the world without much thought. This is not how denialism usually works. Denialists usually labour for decades to produce, often against overwhelming odds, carefully crafted simulacra of scholarship that, to non-experts at least, are indistinguishable from the real thing. They have refined alternative scholarly techniques that can cast doubt on even the most solid of truths.Trump and the post-truthers’ “lazy” denialism rests on the security that comes from knowing that generations of denialists have created enough doubt already all people like Trump need to do is to signal vaguely in a denialist direction. Whereas denialism explains – at great length – post-denialism asserts. Whereas denialism is painstakingly thought-through, post-denialism is instinctive. Whereas denialism is disciplined, post-denialism is anarchic.The internet has been an important factor in this weakening of denialist self-discipline. The intemperance of the online world is pushing denialism so far that it is beginning to fall apart. The new generation of denialists aren’t creating new, alternative orthodoxies so much as obliterating the very idea of orthodoxy itself. The collective, institutional work of building a substantial bulwark against scholarly consensus gives way to a kind of free-for-all.One example of this is the 911 truth movement. Because the attacks occurred in an already wired world, the denialism it spawned has never managed to institutionalise and develop an orthodoxy in the way that pre-internet denialisms did. Those who believe that the “official story” of the September 11 attacks was a lie can believe that elements in the US government had foreknowledge of the attacks but let them happen, or that the attacks were deliberately planned and carried out by the government, or that JewsIsraelMossad were behind it, or that shadowy forces in the “New World Order” were behind it – or some cocktail of all of these. They can believe that the towers were brought down by controlled demolition, or that no planes hit the towers, or that there were no floors in the towers, or that there were no passengers in the planes.Post-denialism represents a freeing of the repressed desires that drive denialism. While it still based on the denial of an established truth, its methods liberate a deeper kind of desire: to remake truth itself, to remake the world, to unleash the power to reorder reality itself and stamp one’s mark on the planet. What matters in post-denialism is not the establishment of an alternative scholarly credibility, so much as giving yourself blanket permission to see the world however you like.While post-denialism has not yet supplanted its predecessor, old-style denialism is beginning to be questioned by some of its practitioners as they take tentative steps towards a new age. This is particularly evident on the racist far right, where the dominance of Holocaust denial is beginning to erode.Mark Weber, director of the (denialist) Institute for Historical Review, glumly concluded in an article in 2009 that Holocaust denial had become irrelevant in a world that continues to memorialise the genocide. Some Holocaust deniers have even recanted, expressing their frustration with the movement and acknowledging that many of its claims are simply untenable, as Eric Hunt, previously a producer of widely circulated online videos denying the Holocaust, did in 2016. Yet such admissions of defeat are certainly not accompanied by a retreat from antisemitism. Weber treats the failures of Holocaust denial as a consequence of the nefarious power of the Jews: “Suppose The New York Times were to report tomorrow that Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust centre and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum had announced that no more than 1 million Jews died during the second world war, and that no Jews were killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz. The impact on Jewish-Zionist power would surely be minimal.”Indeed, the Daily Stormer, one of the most prominent online publications of the resurgent far-right, demonstrates an exuberant agility in balancing denialism, post-denialism and open hatred simultaneously, using humour as a method of floating between them all. But there is no doubt what the ultimate destination is. As Andrew Anglin, who runs the site, put it in a style guide for contributors that was later leaked to the press: “The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not. There should also be a conscious awareness of mocking stereotypes of hateful racists. I usually think of this as self-deprecating humour – I am a racist making fun of stereotypes of racists, because I don’t take myself super-seriously. This is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that’s neither here nor there.”Not all denialists are taking these steps towards open acknowledgment of their desires. In some fields, the commitment to repressing desire remains strong. We are not yet at a stage when a climate change denier can come out and say, proudly, “Bangladesh will be submerged, millions will suffer as a result of anthropogenic climate change, but we must still preserve our carbon-based way of life, no matter what the cost.” Nor are anti-vaxxers ready to argue that, even though vaccines do not cause autism, the death of children from preventable diseases is a regrettable necessity if we are to be released from the clutches of Big Pharma.Still, over time it is likely that traditional denialists will be increasingly influenced by the emerging post-denialist milieu. After all, what oil industry-funded wonk labouring to put together a policy paper suggesting that polar bear populations aren’t declining hasn’t fantasised of resorting to gleeful, Trumpian assertions?The possibility of an epochal shift away from denialism means that there is now no avoiding a reckoning with some discomfiting issues: how do we respond to people who have radically different desires and morals from our own? How do we respond to people who delight in or are indifferent to genocide, to the suffering of millions, to venality and greed?Denialism, and the multitude of other ways that modern humans have obfuscated their desires, prevent a true reckoning with the unsettling fact that some of us might desire things that most of us regard as morally reprehensible. I say “might” because while denialism is an attempt to covertly legitimise an unspeakable desire, the nature of the denialist’s understanding of the consequences of enacting that desire is usually unknowable.It is hard to tell whether global warming denialists are secretly longing for the chaos and pain that global warming will bring, are simply indifferent to it, or would desperately like it not to be the case but are overwhelmed with the desire to keep things as they are. It is hard to tell whether Holocaust deniers are preparing the ground for another genocide, or want to keep a pristine image of the goodness of the Nazis and the evil of the Jews. It is hard to tell whether an Aids denialist who works to prevent Africans from having access to anti-retrovirals is getting a kick out of their power over life and death, or is on a mission to save them from the evils of the west.If the new realm of unrestrained online discourse, and the example set by Trump, tempts more and more denialists to transition towards post-denialism and beyond, we will finally know where we stand. Instead of chasing shadows, we will be able to contemplate the stark moral choices we humans face.Maybe we have been putting this test off for too long. The liberation of desire we are beginning to witness is forcing us all to confront some very difficult questions: who are we as a species? Do we all (the odd sociopath aside) share a common moral foundation? How do we relate to people whose desires are starkly different from our own?Perhaps, if we can face up to the challenge presented by these new revelations, it might pave the way for a politics shorn of illusion and moral masquerade, where different visions of what it is to be human can openly contend. This might be a firmer foundation on which to rekindle some hope for human progress – based not on illusions of what we would like to be, but on an accounting of what we are.Adapted from Denial: The Unspeakable Truth by Keith Kahn-Harris, which will be published by Notting Hill Editions on 13 September, and is available to pre-order at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e18e9b4b959f95f236be8544b63a902ea42457/0_0_2816_1944/master/2816.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0a5279a7f272552417f1e34e5e213f5 700w","title":"labour offered to drop margaret hodge disciplinary action","story":"MP who called Corbyn antisemitic publishes exchange of letters in which her lawyers dismissed suggestion as ‘bizarre’Labour offered to drop disciplinary action against Dame Margaret Hodge in the party’s antisemitism dispute, on the condition she issued an “appropriate apology”.The veteran Labour MP has published a three-page letter dated 25 July from the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, on her Facebook page.Hodge said: “This is the continuing correspondence with the Labour party.“I’m still no wiser as to what I’m accused of the nature of complaints received who the investigating officer is or what the timeframe for the investigation will be. Is this fair?”Hodge labelled the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, antisemitic and racist in a heated exchange after the party leadership refused to sign up to the internationally recognised International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) code of conduct in full.Hodge, a secular Jew with relatives who died in Auschwitz concentration camp, called for disciplinary investigations against her and her colleague Ian Austin to be ended.She also demanded that Corbyn sign up to the code in full, and reports suggest the Labour leader could be gearing up for a climbdown speech on the issue at the Jewish Museum next week.The letter sent last month to Hodge’s lawyer says a “warning and reprimand” from the chief whip would enable the investigation “to be brought to an end, on condition your client gives in short order an appropriate apology for her conduct”.The letter adds that, should the investigation continue, “your client will be provided with further information at the appropriate stage”.The investigation is expected to continue as Hodge has not offered any apology to date, instead criticising the party for failing to outline the accusations against her, and continuing to draw attention to alleged antisemitic behaviour.The letter says: “Complaints were received from a number of iniduals about your client’s conduct in parliament on 17 July. The party is investigating the circumstances.“If the present investigation continues to the interview stage, at that point the substance of the information obtained will be put to your client and she will have a full opportunity to respond.“We are currently at the very beginning of the process. Nobody has prejudged the outcome, nor is there any improper motive for the investigation.“The suggestions in your letter to the contrary are entirely unsubstantiated and it is unacceptable for you to cast doubt on the integrity of party’s staff or processes by making them.”The letter adds: “To be clear, the current investigation is not directed to your client raising concerns about antisemitism.“As the chief whip’s letter points out, Labour party members have a right to raise concerns about antisemitism. The party is making considerable efforts to address that issue.“Rather the investigation is concerned with the alleged abusive manner in which your client behaved.”The letter says there is “no threat” against Hodge but does reference the possibility of suspension.

The Mays arrived from Lake Garda in Italy, where they had been holidaying.May was counting on a personal approach to persuade Macron to soften EU resistance to her Brexit plan during their “informal” two-hour meeting.The prime minister, in a dark jacket and grey dress with a necklace of large green and white balls, and Macron, in a long-sleeved shirt and dark tie, sat side by side at a table installed in the interior courtyard of the fort. Their advisers were seated either side of the table. Behind them, a union jack, an EU flag and a French tricolore had been hastily installed.Footage of the meeting, relayed without sound, showed much nodding by both leaders.The 13th-century fortress at Brégançon on France’s Mediterranean coast is the presidential equivalent of Balmoral or Camp David.Fort de Brégançon sits on a tiny 35-metre-high rock off the coast, and has been the official summer retreat of French presidents since 1968.Not all of them have enjoyed the stay.Charles de Gaulle, the first president to stay there after requisitioning the site, left after one night complaining of small, uncomfortable beds and that he was plagued by mosquitos. He never returned.Georges Pompidou and his wife, Claude, liked holidaying at Brégançon in the late 1960s and early 1970s, installing the preferred huge white leather sofas and Plexiglas tables of the era.France’s first socialist president, François Mitterrand, held talks with the then German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, at the fort, but only actually stayed there once. Jacques Chirac was bored there, and Nicolas Sarkozy was pictured with his supermodel-turned-singer wife, Carla Bruni, there before they married. They did not return after.Brégançon, where Napoleon Bonaparte once stayed in the winter of 1793-94, fell into disrepair until it was decommissioned as a military base in 1919. Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, have installed a €35,000 (£31,500) swimming pool, partly in an attempt to avoid the paparazzi who have snapped previous presidents and their partners on the fort’s private beach.Inside the fortress is said to be as austere as it is from the exterior and more like a country house than a presidential palace.Stéphane Bern, a French royal expert who visited the retreat, said: “It symbolises the prestige of the state. Everything there is sober and in good taste, without gold taps.” Kim WillsherWhatever May’s expectations, Macron made it clear beforehand that he would do nothing to undermine the efforts of the EU’s designated negotiator, Michel Barnier.“The plan was to go to Brégançon, which is to be a summer residence but also a place for working, and since May was finishing her vacation in Italy we proposed hosting her here,” a source in Macron’s office said.May was going to lay out “London’s position on the Brexit talks and its future relations with the EU,” the source said. “It will be the occasion to clarify this proposal and discuss the political context.”Macron has long dismissed attempts by British negotiators to ide and rule, refusing to become personally involved in the talks and potentially weaken Barnier’s hand.As a result, the Elysée said there would be no press conference or statement after the meeting. “There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Michel Barnier,” the presidential source added.Pressure is growing on May to win allies on the continent after her Chequers plan prompted two of her ministers to resign in protest last month. She has just a few months before an agreement on Britain’s orce from the EU – due on 29 March 2019 – must be forged in principle ahead of a European summit in mid-October.France is seen as having taken a particularly hard line in the Brexit negotiations, especially on financial services, with Paris already expecting to get about 3,500 new banking jobs as leading players move operations out of London.The source in Macron’s office said Barnier had maintained that any Brexit accord “must conform with the economic interests of the 27 remaining EU members, and the president has always supported this as well.” But Macron also wanted to avoid a “messy orce”.On Friday the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was “uncomfortably high” and such an outcome would lead to higher prices.He said the UK and EU should “do all things to avoid” a no-deal scenario, but added that the country’s financial system was in a position to be able to withstand such a shock.Asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether no-deal would be a disaster, he said: “It is highly undesirable. Parties should do all things to avoid it.”Pushed on what no-deal would mean, he said: “Disruption to trade as we know it.” He added: “As a consequence of that, a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ec2c8b094f9ff94f03faa4169f1cc244442c9d/0_234_961_577/master/961.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43c574d3757c95e9069dd2f3c7b9c40a","title":"mother drinks all day refuses help annalisa barbieri","story":"You need to learn to build emotional boundaries, says Annalisa BarbieriMy mother has always been a difficult, stubborn and independent woman with an alcohol problem that was largely mitigated by my father when he was alive. Since his death seven years ago, she has been in a spiral of anger, depression and alcohol dependency. She has been verbally abusive, is full of resentment and rage that her life is not what she wants it to be, is lonely and, at 72, believes she has nothing to live for despite having children, grandchildren, friends and family. Over the past 18 months she has become largely voluntarily bed-ridden, drinks all day, suffers from depression, has a poor diet, doesn’t exercise and has no interests. She is drinking herself to death and refusing to seek any advice or support. My brother and I live overseas and we Skype her each weekend she also has friends and family literally knocking on her door, but refuses all help. She is financially secure, with a wonderful life available to her, and we have all been trying to motivate her by encouraging her to be well enough to visit us, but we are at an impasse she will not seek medical assistance or let friends or family help. I am unable to speak to her doctor, because he will not take my call and discuss a patient. I do not know what else I can do. She had a mental-health assessment last year, and her struggles have been documented and shared with her doctor formally, but nothing has changed. My aunt, brother and I do have power of attorney for her assets, but not her health and welfare. What you want is to save your mother but you can’t unless she is willing to save herself: it’s a cliche, but you really need to start believing it. So you need to learn to build emotional boundaries. You’ve already built physical ones by living on the other side of the world from your tricky mother but, emotionally, you are still very enmeshed with her and, as she’s highly manipulative, some separating out is vital to stop you being hurt.I use a visual aid to help me with emotional boundaries. Imagine you are sitting on one side of a thick, glass barrier, and the other person is on the other side. You can see the person, but you can do your bit only “up to the glass”. You can’t stop the other person from doing what they want, and sometimes you have to sit and watch them self-destruct. It can really help you to understand that, sometimes, you can only do so much – the rest is up to them. You have to learn to let go. Addictions specialist and psychotherapist (and a former addict himself), Mike Delaney (bacp), says that addictions are often based in past trauma. He explains that people with addictions “can become really arrogant, but what they feel underneath it all is shame. Anger is usually the default, easy-to-go-to, secondary emotion. It pushes people away.” And this pushing away allows them to avoid facing up to their situation the cycle of shame, anger, denial and the need to blot everything out with the addiction continues. I know you and your brother feel guilty for living on the other side of the world, but I think this is a good thing. Even if you lived nearby – and plenty of people who care about her do – she would refuse help and you would just feel even more wretched.It’s true the GP can’t discuss your mother with you, but you could write a letter explaining the situation again and saying it’s not improved. You could also call the social services department in her area and talk about what, if anything, can be done. You mention having power of attorney even if you had that for health and welfare, it would kick in only if your mother no longer had the capacity to act for herself.You might want to consider writing to her to say you love her and that if she wants help, you are there for her. It may help remind you that you have offered her something concrete.Finally, take the emotion out of it and think about this practically: what can you do? Not very much beyond what’s mentioned above and what you already do. It’s not going to be easy. Watching a loved one do this to themselves is heartbreaking, but it is your mother’s choice you haven’t done this to her and you can’t save her on your own. Look into ways of supporting yourself, too – there will be organisations where you live that support the families of alcoholics.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

But the team announced on Friday the Australian had informed them he would be leaving at the end of the Formula One season, with his move to Renault confirmed shortly afterwards.The 29-year-old has been with Red Bull since 2014 having made his F1 debut three years earlier with the now-defunct HRT. Ricciardo, who has also driven for Toro Rosso, has won seven races for his current team, including two victories this year, in China and Monaco. He is fourth in the 2018 drivers’ championship after a fourth-placed finish at last weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix.“I thought it was time for me to take on a fresh and new challenge,” Ricciardo said. “I realise there is a lot ahead in order to allow Renault to reach their target of competing at the highest level but I have been impressed by their progression in only two years, and I know each time Renault has been in the sport they eventually won. I hope to be able to help them in this journey and contribute on and off track.”Renault confirmed Ricciardo has signed a two-year deal and will drive alongside Nico Hülkenberg. Ricciardo is no stranger to Renault, who have provided engines for Red Bull during his time at the team.Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, thanked Ricciardo for his efforts. “We fully respect Daniel’s decision to leave Red Bull Racing and we wish him all the best in his future,” he said. “We would like to thank him for his dedication and the role he has played, the highlights of course being the seven wins and 29 podiums he has achieved so far with us.”The signing of Ricciardo – who will replace Carlos Sainz Jr – is a statement of intent, according to Renault’s managing director, Cyril Abiteboul. “Daniel’s signing underscores our determination to accelerate our progress towards the forefront of the sport,” he said. “It is also a recognition of the work accomplished over the past two and a half seasons.“Daniel’s undoubted talent and charisma are a huge bonus and statement for the team. We will have to repay his faith in us by delivering the best car possible.

Forget the flaws that are all too evident on both sides and savour a delicious equation. On Saturday India require 84 runs, England five wickets for victory in a captivating Test match in which Virat Kohli has been the dominant figure. He remains on 43 and while he is there India have a good chance.Earlier in the day there had been moments when an India victory looked a formality as England faltered badly in the first session. Off the field there was just what the home side were yearning for, a full and boisterous house on it just what they dreaded, a tepid batting display that quickly punctured the hopes of the spine-tingling contest that had tantalised the minds of the 20-odd thousand who made their way to Edgbaston. Just after lunch England had slumped to 87 for seven, a lead of 100. All the batsmen had gone, so too any credible expectation of a decent game.Then along came Sam Curran and his icy, schoolboy eyes, a young man who is still in the foothills of his Test match experience. England in the mire again, a Test team in crisis and the pressure mounting? Not for Sam. This was just a wonderful challenge, an opportunity to have some fun or, as they say today, “to showcase his skill”. He cracked two sixes and nine fours in a run-a-ball 63. Suddenly India had to make 194 to win and they had never successfully achieved such a large victory target in England. At last the supporters had something to shout about in the Hollies stand.Yet in the first half of the day England had made a mess again and one could start predicting the “you can lose a Test match in just one bad session” and “you can’t afford to do that against the No\u0026nbsp1 ranked side in the world” explanations, not to mention the “they have been catching well in practice”.In fact England have endured several poor sessions in this match, squandering a solid base on the first day as well as those catches on the second, while on the third morning Ravi Ashwin and Ishant Sharma, two familiar old foes, expertly worked their way through a powder-puff line-up that was technically and temperamentally ill-equipped to cope. England went 1-0 down to India four years ago when Sharma was instrumental in victory on the last afternoon at Lord’s after taking seven for 74, mostly with bouncers. He might have conjured another famous win here.Ashwin had purveyed two overs on this tour before the Test yet he has still bowled impeccably and made the early incisions. There is no better bowler at left-handers and soon he found significant turn to Keaton Jennings, whose outside edge presented a straightforward catch to KL Rahul in the gully. Ashwin’s next wicket was more significant it was that of Joe Root, who, as ever, had acclimatised with few alarms. Yet here he was snapped up at leg slip from the face of the bat. It was a careless dismissal, which led to a stunned silence from the crowd and Root depositing his hand on his head in a what-have-I-done pose.Now Sharma took over. Four years ago he undermined England with short balls here he bowled fuller, consistently finding movement against England’s army of left-handers. He had prepared for this differently to Ashwin by bowling for Sussex in the county championship. Sharma found rhythm and swing either side of lunch and confounded the middle order.Soon he found the edge of Dawid Malan’s bat as he did with Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, who just managed to avoid a pair. As a few members of England’s Greatest XI, selected by the public in another questionable advert for referenda, were presented to the crowd at lunchtime, the mood was grim but the last three wickets mustered 93 runs thanks to Curran. There were some outside edges but also some mighty blows down the ground off both Ashwin and Sharma, which finally opened the throats of those in the stands. At last leafy Edgbaston was transformed into a Brummie colosseum.Next on stage was Stuart Broad, who had fluffed his lines (and lengths) in the first innings, which meant that he was only required to bowl 10 overs. Now something clicked. Murali Vijay, dropped by Malan off Jimmy Anderson on one, padded up and Broad celebrated, just remembering to turn to face the umpire in his appeal as he reached the other end of the pitch. Up went the finger, so too the decibel count. In the next over Shikhar Dhawan, just as in his first-innings dismissal, played an airy drive and was caught behind Broad was a protagonist again.Now Stokes, currently mightier with the ball than the bat, intervened, having Rahul caught behind, which left India tottering on 46 for three. Soon after the irrepressible Curran, despite being on the receiving end of two silky drives from Kohli, found the inside edge of Ajinkya Rahane’s bat. Then Ashwin, peculiarly promoted, edged against Anderson to give Bairstow his fourth catch of the innings.England’s senior men were eager to whip up the crowd, who were happy to respond. No one left early. There was just one problem – Kohli. He remained, watchful and willing himself to appear nonchalantly calm amid the mayhem at the other end. England tried a review against him and the ball was straight but it was passing over the stumps – even though it had been bowled by Curran. Kohli, the colossus, was playing a different game to the rest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38ceead8720892a8dd0b8e957af1a9fcc7a87a2/146_108_3689_2214/master/3689.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d326065bc5c61d1c1abb659520173a5a","title":"england v india first test day three live","story":"A classic Test match twisted this way and that before India closed on 110 for five, needing another 84 to win, with Virat Kohli still at the crease36th over: India 110-5 (Kohli 43, Karthik 18) Karthik, who has played really well under a lot of pressure, takes most of Stokes’s last over to end another memorable day in this classic Test match.

There are four singles from the over, and we’ll only have time for one more tonight. 34th over: India 105-5 (Kohli 41, Karthik 15) Stokes has decided to pepper Karthik, with two men out on the hook and another at leg gully. I’d like to have seen Curran get two overs before the close but that’s not going to happen now. “Let’s be honest,” says our own Ali Martin. “It’s Graham Gooch at Lord’s in 1990 isn’t it?” Hmm, that was immense but it was on the flattest of pitches in the middle of the definitive summer of runs. What sets Kohli apart, if he wins this with something like 102 not out, is that it’s been such a low-scoring game.33rd over: India 104-5 (Kohli 40, Karthik 15) Kohli is beaten for the first time in a while, pushing at a fine legcutter from Broad. After that disgraceful show of weakness, he defends the rest of the over immaculately.“Colum Farrelly (30th over) is not the first to suggest this,” says Niall Mullen. “It may be that my fixation on sport has affected my success in other areas of life but I regret nothing*.”32nd over: India 103-5 (Kohli 39, Karthik 15) The indefatigable Stokes surprises Karthik with a well-directed short ball that is expertly defended. There’s just over 15 minutes’ play remaining. England would take stumps now I think.“Regardless of the result, India will surely bring Pujara back in for the next Test,” says Anand. “Was really shocked that he was dropped. Wonder who is going to be left out - Dhawan or Rahul....”I’d drop Dhawan, who looks like a walking wicket against the moving ball. Mind you, it might not move much at Lord’s.31st over: India 103-5 (Kohli 39, Karthik 15) England are just starting to look like a team who would be happy to come back tomorrow. Kohli, who played and missed a fair bit early on, looks immovable now and Karthik has been positive in both attack and defence. I’d get Sam Curran on for Stokes I’m not sure it’s worth risking Adil Rashid at this stage.Thanks for all your emails about the greatest match performance by a batsman in a Test. A couple of you have suggested VVS Laxman at Kolkata in 2001, when he batted very well in the first innings and immortally in the second. Alec Stewart in Barbados in 1993-94 is another one that has been mentioned.30th over: India 101-5 (Kohli 38, Karthik 14) Hardik Pandya, the next man in, is dancing round the dressing-room with his headphones on. He is fooling precisely nobody. That said, this is a good little spell for India, who were 78 for five not so long ago. A leg-bye brings up their hundred. It might be time for Sam Curran to replace the weary Ben Stokes, who has another LBW appeal turned down when Karthik gets outside the line to another booming inswinger.“I know Test cricket is magnificent, the King Of Sports,” says Colum Farrelly, “but I think Niall Mullen (18:03) has a bit of work to do on his orgasms.”29th over: India 98-5 (Kohli 36, Karthik 14) Stuart Broad, who was rampant in his first spell, replaces Jimmy Anderson. Karthik is beaten, feeling optimistically for a wide one, and then snicks wide of third slip for four.“The greatest match performance by a batsman,” writes Oliver Bierhoff. “Rahul Dravid at Adelaide in 2003?”Ah yeah! That’s right up there.28th over: India 94-5 (Kohli 36, Karthik 10) Karthik drives Stokes through the covers for four, a classy and confident shot. India are almost halfway to their target of 194. England are already halfway to theirs, but it won’t feel that way with Kohli at the crease.27th over: India 89-5 (Kohli 36, Karthik 5) Anderson continues to ram his head against the brick wall that is Virat Kohli. India’s batting line-up is like a Panini swapshop: GOT, GOT, GOT, BLOODY WELL NEED LIKE I’VE NEVER NEEDED ANYTHING IN MY LIFE, GOT, GOT, PRETTY SURE I CAN GET, PRETTY SURE I CAN GET, PRETTY SURE I CAN GET, PRETTY SURE I CAN GET, PRETTY SURE I CAN GET.We know all about the greatest innings in Test history – Lara, Gooch, Smith etc - but what is the greatest match performance by a batsman? Whatever it is, it may lost its status in the next 18 hours. (One contender would be this from Allan Border, which is beyond ridiculous.)26th over: India 87-5 (Kohli 35, Karthik 4) Play is scheduled to finish at 1850 local time, so in about 45 minutes, but either team could claim the extra half-hour if victory is possible. Stokes, who dismissed Karthik in the first innings, has a big LBW appeal turned down after another booming inswinger. It was probably doing too much and England decide not to risk their last review. Hawkeye shows it would have been umpire’s call on point of contact with the leg bail. A soft-handed edge from Kohli then falls short of Jennings, who does well to save three runs with a e to his right.25th over: India 83-5 (Kohli 34, Karthik 1) Kohli, the astonishing Kohli, works Anderson off the hip for four. While he is at the crease, England will be uneasy. This isn’t as good as cricket gets it’s as good as life gets. With that in mind, Niall Mullen has been thinking about the Scottish film.“Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you’re still nowhere near.”I’m glad you picked that quote rather than the other one.Justice for Jimmy! The ball after being snicked for four, Anderson finds Ashwin’s outside edge with another classic outswinger, and Bairstow does the rest. That’s his first wicket of the innings and the third of the match. He deserves at least twice that.24th over: India 73-4 (Kohli 29, Ashwin 9) Curran’s reward for that wicket is … an unwelcome breather, with Stokes coming on to replace him. The dangerous Ashwin clouts a square drive for four before playing and missing outside off stump. The ball has beaten the bat so much in this game. There are even unconfirmed reports that Virat Kohli played and missed. Stokes ends the over with a huge inswinger to Ashwin that brings an unsuccessful shout for LBW. It was going down the leg side, and there may have been an inside edge.23rd over: India 69-4 (Kohli 29, Ashwin 5) It looks like Ashwin has been sent in to have a dash and try to unsettle England. Anderson beats Ashwin with consecutive hooping outswingers. He has two wickets in 31 overs in this match there are lies, damned lies and bowling figures.“That Bairstow catch was identical to the earlier Dhawan catch with main difference being the soft signal,” says Sunil Bishnoi. “Great debate by commentary team about how there should be no indication from field empire to influence the final decision if he is not sure. Both decision should have been out.”Yes, agreed, the soft signal makes it a bit of a mess. But if there’s no soft signal, surely more would be given not out? I don’t know enough about the technology but the situation is not ideal. Still, at least it’s not VAR!22nd over: India 67-4 (Kohli 28, Ashwin 4) Well, this is interesting: Ravi Ashwin has been promoted to No6. He’s not a nightwatchman as there is still at least an hour’s play remaining. He gets off the mark with a solid punch through the covers for four.Sam Curran strikes! Rahane, set up by a couple of inswingers, chased a wide one and inside-edged low to Bairstow. The catch went upstairs, but crucially the soft signal was out and the third umpire upheld the on-field decision.21st over: India 63-3 (Kohli 28, Rahane 2) Anderson to Kohlli, who resists the usual variety of outswingers. Another maiden. This is some battle of wills between Anderson and Kohli.20th over: India 63-3 (Kohli 28, Rahane 2) Curran ends a brilliant over with a swinging lifter that hits the gloves off Rahane. This is wonderful stuff. You can keep your “narcotics”: I’ve got Test cricket.“Gary Naylor’s sage observation about the distorting impact of Virat Kohli (17th over) prompts the thought that cricket needs some sort of formal handicapping system to even things up a bit where the greats are concerned,” says Brian Withington. “England have already pioneered the construct of a slip cordon that can’t catch to limit Jimmy Anderson’s effectiveness. About time VK was required to bat with a stick of rhubarb andor wear flip flops at the crease?”Given his recent form, he could start every innings on minus 100. Kohli pushed around a terrific inswinger from Curran, with his bat getting stuck behind the pad. It hit the flap of the pad, and replays showed it was bouncing over the top: Kohli is not out and England also lose a review. But it was worth the risk.Calm down, I don’t think it’s out.19th over: India 62-3 (Kohli 27, Rahane 2) Anderson replaces Stokes, who will probably change ends. His first delivery is a gorgeous outswinger that beats Kohli, who push-drives the next ball classily for three. Lovely cricket from two absolute champions. I’d kill to be a fly on the wall when they sit down for a chat at the end of the series.18th over: India 59-3 (Kohli 24, Rahane 2) A wide delivery from Curran is driven gloriously for four by Kohli. This bloke has nigh-on perfected batting, and he is starting to intimidate Curran. It looks like Anderson is going to come back on.Meanwhile, this is a terrific bit of recall from my colleague Jason Deans, who compares that Stokes jaffa to dismiss Rahul to one of the many magic moments of 2005.17th over: India 54-3 (Kohli 19, Rahane 2) Stokes was all over Rahane in the first innings, which will be in the mind of both men. The floodlights are back on, which is good news for England as the ball may swing more as a result. A quiet over from Stokes passes without incident worthy of being recorded in the contemporary liveblog format. “You look at the scoreboard and you think England are ahead: you look at the middle and you think India are ahead,” says Gary Naylor. “Test cricket eh?”16th over: India 51-3 (Kohli 18, Rahane 0) Kohli survives a huge shout for caught behind from Curran! The bowler and slips were sure there was an edge, but Bairstow insisted the noise was bat on pad and replays showed he was right. Excellent work from him and more importantly the umpire Chris Gaffaney. A good over is tarnished by a poor delivery that Kohli times through the covers for four. This is exhilarating stuff, a 20-year-old in his salad days against an all-time great in a never ending purple patch. Curran responds with another fine inswinger that Kohli inside edges onto the pad.15th over: India 46-3 (Kohli 13, Rahane 0) That was the last ball of the over. What a snorter from Ben Stokes! KL Rahul is squared up by a beautiful delivery that kicks off the the seam, takes a thin edge and is pouched by Jonny Bairstow. Rahul had to play at that, even though it was unplayable. 14th over: India 45-2 (Rahul 13, Kohli 12) A double bowling change, with Sam Curran replacing Broad. As my colleague Tim de Lisle points out, we thought this match would be Kohli v Anderson and it’s turned out to be Kohli v Curran. His first delivery is a lovely inswinger that Rahul inside-edges onto the pad, negating the inevitable LBW appeal. A couple more inswingers make it a really promising first over.13th over: India 43-2 (Rahul 12, Kohli 11) There is a bowling change - but it’s Stokes, rather than Curran, who replaces Anderson. Kohli offers no stroke to an outswinger that kicks nastily to smack him just above the elbow. There will always be good and bad with Stokes, and the next ball is a swinging half-volley that is scrunched through the covers for three. It would have been four but for a marvellous piece of fielding from Buttler. We’ll remember that if England win by one run.12th over: India 39-2 (Rahul 11, Kohli 7) Anderson and Broad know they can’t bowl much longer – they’ve had six overs each - but will be desperate to take Kohli with them. I’d be tempted to bring on Sam Curran at Anderson’s end and give Broad two more. Broad appeals unsuccessfully for LBW when an inducker shaves the pad of Rahul, who like Vijay offered no stroke. This time it was too high and didn’t come back enough. Here’s John Withington. “John Starbuck’s “slow bowler with a fast mouth” makes me beg for a sharing of the legend of the late and much loved Robbie Horsnell of Hornchurch cricket fame. A lovable catweasel of a cricketer, he frequently turned out in carpet slippers which he would park behind the stumps at the bowler’s end during spells of his ultra-slow right arm filth. Easily exhausted after a brief spell of boundary chasing with keys jangling in his cardigan pockets he once famously achieved three F words in a five-word sentence .... ‘F me I’m F’in F’ed’!”I presume his hero was John Emburey.11th over: India 35-2 (Rahul 10, Kohli 5) Anderson v Kohli, the main attraction in the first innings, almost feels like filler while we wait for another Stuart Broad over. As in that first innings, Kohli is playing Anderson with a lot of respect and ignoring as much as possible outside off stump.“Kohli’s first innings is possibly the best I’ve seen in England in the past 78 years but he may need to surpass that now,” says Andrew Hurley. “On a side note, India are number one in the world with one great batsman (I realise Rahane’s figures are good but...)”10th over: India 31-2 (Rahul 10, Kohli 1) Rahul survives a big shout for LBW from Broad after getting in a bit of a tangle. England do not review on the advice of Ben Stokes, who says there was an inside-edge. Replays confirm that Ben Stokes does not need to go to Specsavers. Broad is threatening with almost every delivery at the moment, and later in the over Rahul inside-edges over the top of the stumps for four. The Edgbaston atmosphere is getting more primal.“Who replaces Malan?” sniffs Jonathan Taylor. “I would have thought the answer was simple – the leading run scorer in the County Championship: Rory Burns. He can either open \u0026amp CookJennings can bat at No3 leaving Root to bat in his favoured spot or Burns can go in at No4. That aside it can hardly be a surprise that a bloke that can hardly buy a run in Division 2 this summer has struggled at Test cricket.”I like Burns, and more importantly so does Dale Steyn, but I doubt England will want to reshuffle the batting order again. Whoever comes in surely has to bat No4, even if it is Burns.9th over: India 27-2 (Rahul 6, Kohli 1) Oof! Kohli is beaten by a jaffa from Anderson that pitches on a fourth-stump line and straightens past the edge. For the rest of the over Kohli is happy to leave everything, so it’s a maiden. This is the game, right here. If England get Kohli in the next 10 or 20 minutes they will be favourites.“Is something brilliant happening?” asks Stephen Byrom. “Almost certainly not. It’s 2018 and England are playing a test match. Get a grip, Rob.” Two words, one syllable: Headingley 81. 8th over: India 27-2 (Rahul 6, Kohli 1) Kohli v Anderson yesterday was electric. Kohli v Broad might be even better, because Broad is rampaging in and looks right in the mood to produce one of his devastating spells. Hoo hoo, it’s good to be alive. His first ball to Kohli is straight and clipped away for a single then Rahul, after being beaten outside off stump, flicks confidently for four. This is wonderful cricket.Broad is registering high on the kneepumpometer, which is always a good sign for England. And now he’s got his second wicket! Broad tempted Dhawan into a loose drive with a full outswinger from around the wicket, and Jonny Bairstow did the rest. Broad has two wickets and is on one. Is something brilliant happening?7th over: India 21-1 (Dhawan 13, Rahul 1) Rahul gets off the mark with a tight single to mid-off. Sam Curran hit the stumps from mid-off but Rahul was comfortably home Aleem Dar went upstairs just to make sure.“He hasn’t scored the runs and is becoming a liability in the slips,” says Adam Roberts. “Any reason for Malan to keep his place?”His temperament. Giving him a fair crack. Lord’s is his home ground. England have already made lots of changes this summer. I don’t think it’s an obvious decision but I’d probably leave him out for Lord’s and I suspect that’s what will happen. Who replaces him though?6th over: India 19-1 (Dhawan 12, Rahul 0) Hawkeye confirms that delivery was hitting the top of middle, so Vijay was right not to review. Broad’s first ball beats a tentative push from KL Rahul. He might just be getting on a roll here.“I was in a team which had a bowler removed for ungentlemanly conduct by the umpire for ******* **** ********* swearing as he delivered it,” says John Starbuck. “He was a slow bowler with a fast mouth.”England have their first wicket! Vijay pads up to a fullish delivery from Broad that jags back to hit the pad. He was outside the line but that doesn’t matter as he didn’t play a shot. It looked really close and, though you sense Vijay wanted to review, Dhawan politely advised him to do one and use his bat next time.5th over: India 16-0 (Vijay 4, Dhawan 11) Vijay is dropped by Malan at second slip! It was a sharp chance to his right when Vijay drove at a seductive outswinger from the luckless Anderson, and Malan could only clang it towards third man. Ach! Fielding has been the difference in this match. Poor Malan has had a nightmare in what might turn out to be his last Test. Anderson ends the over by beating Vijay with a beauty. He is magnificent.4th over: India 9-0 (Vijay 1, Dhawan 8) An outswinger from Broad is left by Dhawan and bursts through Bairstow for a bye, a rare bit of poor wicketkeeping from him. Nothing much else to report. It’s been a great start for India. Jonathan Hungin points out that England were chasing the same target, 194, when Curtly Ambrose bowled them out for 46. But by the time they have nine runs on the board they’d lost three wickets, and the collective noggin.3rd over: India 8-0 (Vijay 1, Dhawan 7) There is a bit of swing for Anderson the ball is mumbling rather than talking at this stage. Vijay defends a series of outswingers.“On the subject of batsmen changing hands I feel compelled to share one of my now fading batting memories, again from the days at Hornchurch Athletic CC,” says John Withington. “Playing a Sunday game against a far stronger team they batted too long and scored too many. After a couple of early setbacks our reply was falling short of a chase but was, I thought, still respectable. Amidst some early examples of sledging their opening bowler, a feared paceman from a higher league, took to mockingly jogging back to his mark and reeling back in for the next delivery without pause after I’d blocked another straight one. So I decided to bat left handed. He saw it mid run up and got predictably huffy and predictably short pitched ... leading to me hooking him for a boundary. His expletive-peppered followthrough wasn’t helped by the umpire calling no-ball as all the slips had become leg slips due to my changed stance and he had too many behind square!” 2nd over: India 7-0 (Vijay 1, Dhawan 6) Stuart Broad shares the new ball. He has been unwell and there’s an argument for giving it to Sam Curran, but if anything the ageing ball has swung more than the new one in this match. Dhawan gets the first boundary, timing a half-volley sweetly through the covers. Early days I know, but this has been a calm, authoritative start from India.“All said and done, with the multiple swings in momentum, 190 odd seems like a ‘fair’ target to chase,” says Anand. “Pretty nervous about India chasing it down. The batting order did not really inspire confidence in a chase (barring Kohli).”Yes, if England get Kohli in single figures, I think they’ll win. But that’s an elephantine ‘if’.1st over: India 2-0 (Vijay 1, Dhawan 1) James Anderson gets a little bit of swing in a largely uneventful first over. Dhawan survives a gentle LBW enquiry from a ball that pitched outside leg and might have missed leg. England have a third man, thank goodness they conceded a lot of runs down there in the first innings. I think England think this will be really close. It might even finish tonight, Melbourne ’98 style: as Mikey Holding points out on Sky, play could go on until 7.20pm.Thanks Nick. There’s no time for perambulation because the players are out on the field. India need 194 England’s three swing bowlers need to make the ball talk like Brian Blessed. That’s me for the day. Rob Smyth is your man for the remainder. A tense one or a procession? Your emails to Rob.Smyth@the. Here’s that six. What a shot. “Please don’t do that typical English thing,” grumbles Vincent O’Connor, “where a sportsperson performs one act of greatness (and Curran is definitely having a great game) and they immediately get bloated into a national treasure. You’ll be explaining how urn objects are returning home shortly!”Arguably the opposite of hyping players up is even more boring: if you say a promising young player is promising, or even - lord forbid - good, you immediately get accused of bigging him up too much. That will be tea, so India’s chase begins in about 20 minutes. They’ll probably get there, but it is swinging out there...Yadav seems to have decided that short is the way to go at Curran: after a couple he ducks under, Curran hits a pull that goes just - just - over mid-on and to the boundary. But then, trying to get a single to keep the strike, he doesn’t get enough on a guide to third man and nicks through to the keeper. Shame, but a terrific innings that will at least make India work a bit for their (probable) win. 52nd over: England 176-9 (Curran 58, Anderson 0) - England lead by 189 runs Anderson in now. If Curran wasn’t holding back before, he really won’t be holding back now. That’s five wickets for Sharma, by the way: he’s been terrific.

Christopher Renshaw’s musical – in Spanish with English surtitles – relocates Hammerstein’s American wartime story to the Cuban revolution of 1958, which serves less as political context than as a backdrop of human turbulence and heightened emotion. Bizet’s famous music is all in there but, in Alex Lacamoire’s orchestrations, it’s mixed into heady cocktails of arias, lilting mambo rhythms, brassy blasts, Afro-Cuban chants and freeform Latin jazz. The dancers, too, chop and change from salsa to split jumps to folk steps in the blink of an eye. Carmen (Luna Manzanares Nardo) remains the fiery siren of Bizet’s opera, trading recklessly on her erotic capital, and talking a lot dirtier than Bizet would have allowed.Cristina Rodríguez Pino serves as her foil, Marilù: sweet but not hot, and so no competition for the attentions of Saeed Mohamed Valdés’s regular-guy José. There’s a glitzy nightclub scene, some flyby revolutionaries, some wisecracking prostitutes, and a Santería priestess who bangs on about big things: love, death, destiny. The tone ricochets wildly as the scenes whizz past: intense soliloquy, bug-eyed melodrama, comedy caper. The piece builds well towards its climax, a fight scene between a pro-Cuban and a pro-American boxer, ceding to a rope-ringed battle of the sexes (guess who wins) before the stage floods with crimson flowers and flags – but long before then, the bumpy ride has become its own kind of pleasure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8a69915f43df9eabe6465c9bccee3592f6a234/0_0_3500_2297/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f8edd52d055d1c2aca72c0e4d0aa322 700w","title":"japan overworked employees monday mornings off","story":"Shining Mondays scheme will allow employees to start work late one day a monthJapan’s government is to urge companies to give employees Monday mornings off in its latest attempt to improve the country’s poor record on work-life balance.The economy, trade and industry ministry believes that “Shining Mondays”, part of a wider campaign to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, will give employees a much-needed lie-in at the start of the working week, although similar schemes aimed at reducing people’s workload have been largely unsuccessful.The idea is linked to the introduction last February of “Premium Fridays”, where firms are encouraged to allow employees to clock off early and go home to their families or help boost consumer spending.The latest scheme envisages allowing employees to take the morning off on the Monday following the last Friday of the month.The ministry tested the idea last Monday, allowing almost a third of its staff to arrive at the office after lunch.

Can they escape his legacy?On the corner couch of a spacious room, a woman wearing a brightly patterned robe sits expectantly. The red hijab that covers her hair is reflected in a glass-fronted cabinet inside, a framed photograph of her firstborn son takes pride of place between family heirlooms and valuables. A smiling, bearded figure wearing a military jacket, he features in photographs around the room: propped against the wall at her feet, resting on a mantlepiece. A supper of Saudi meze and a lemon cheesecake has been spread out on a large wooden dining table.Alia Ghanem is Osama bin Laden’s mother, and she commands the attention of everyone in the room. On chairs nearby sit two of her surviving sons, Ahmad and Hassan, and her second husband, Mohammed al-Attas, the man who raised all three brothers. Everyone in the family has their own story to tell about the man linked to the rise of global terrorism but it is Ghanem who holds court today, describing a man who is, to her, still a beloved son who somehow lost his way. “My life was very difficult because he was so far away from me,” she says, speaking confidently. “He was a very good kid and he loved me so much.” Now in her mid-70s and in variable health, Ghanem points at al-Attas – a lean, fit man dressed, like his two sons, in an immaculately pressed white thobe, a gown worn by men across the Arabian peninsula. “He raised Osama from the age of three. He was a good man, and he was good to Osama.”The family have gathered in a corner of the mansion they now share in Jeddah, the Saudi Arabian city that has been home to the Bin Laden clan for generations. They remain one of the kingdom’s wealthiest families: their dynastic construction empire built much of modern Saudi Arabia, and is deeply woven into the country’s establishment. The Bin Laden home reflects their fortune and influence, a large spiral staircase at its centre leading to cavernous rooms. Ramadan has come and gone, and the bowls of dates and chocolates that mark the three-day festival that follows it sit on tabletops throughout the house. Large manors line the rest of the street this is well-to-do Jeddah, and while no guard stands watch outside, the Bin Ladens are the neighbourhood’s best-known residents.For years, Ghanem has refused to talk about Osama, as has his wider family – throughout his two-decade reign as al-Qaida leader, a period that saw the strikes on New York and Washington DC, and ended more than nine years later with his death in Pakistan. Now, Saudi Arabia’s new leadership – spearheaded by the ambitious 32-year-old heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – has agreed to my request to speak to the family. (As one of the country’s most influential families, their movements and engagements remain closely monitored.) Osama’s legacy is as grave a blight on the kingdom as it is on his family, and senior officials believe that, by allowing the Bin Ladens to tell their story, they can demonstrate that an outcast – not an agent – was responsible for 911. Saudi Arabia’s critics have long alleged that Osama had state support, and the families of a number of 911 victims have launched (so far unsuccessful) legal actions against the kingdom. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.Unsurprisingly, Osama bin Laden’s family are cautious in our initial negotiations they are not sure whether opening old wounds will prove cathartic or harmful. But after several days of discussion, they are willing to talk. When we meet on a hot day in early June, a minder from the Saudi government sits in the room, though she makes no attempt to influence the conversation. (We are also joined by a translator.)Sitting between Osama’s half-brothers, Ghanem recalls her firstborn as a shy boy who was academically capable. He became a strong, driven, pious figure in his early 20s, she says, while studying economics at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, where he was also radicalised. “The people at university changed him,” Ghanem says. “He became a different man.” One of the men he met there was Abdullah Azzam, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was later exiled from Saudi Arabia and became Osama’s spiritual adviser. “He was a very good child until he met some people who pretty much brainwashed him in his early 20s. You can call it a cult. They got money for their cause. I would always tell him to stay away from them, and he would never admit to me what he was doing, because he loved me so much.”In the early 1980s, Osama travelled to Afghanistan to fight the Russian occupation. “Everyone who met him in the early days respected him,” says Hassan, picking up the story. “At the start, we were very proud of him. Even the Saudi government would treat him in a very noble, respectful way. And then came Osama the mujahid.”A long uncomfortable silence follows, as Hassan struggles to explain the transformation from zealot to global jihadist. “I am very proud of him in the sense that he was my oldest brother,” he eventually continues. “He taught me a lot. But I don’t think I’m very proud of him as a man. He reached superstardom on a global stage, and it was all for nothing.”Ghanem listens intently, becoming more animated when the conversation returns to Osama’s formative years. “He was very straight. Very good at school. He really liked to study. He spent all his money on Afghanistan – he would sneak off under the guise of family business.” Did she ever suspect he might become a jihadist? “It never crossed my mind.” How did it feel when she realised he had? “We were extremely upset. I did not want any of this to happen. Why would he throw it all away like that?”The family say they last saw Osama in Afghanistan in 1999, a year in which they visited him twice at his base just outside Kandahar. “It was a place near the airport that they had captured from the Russians,” Ghanem says. “He was very happy to receive us. He was showing us around every day we were there. He killed an animal and we had a feast, and he invited everyone.”Ghanem begins to relax, and talks about her childhood in the coastal Syrian city of Latakia, where she grew up in a family of Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Syrian cuisine is superior to Saudi, she says, and so is the weather by the Mediterranean, where the warm, wet summer air was a stark contrast to the acetylene heat of Jeddah in June. Ghanem moved to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1950s, and Osama was born in Riyadh in 1957. She orced his father three years later, and married al-Attas, then an administrator in the fledgling Bin Laden empire, in the early 1960s. Osama’s father went on to have 54 children with at least 11 wives.Osama bin Laden’s formative years in Jeddah came in the relatively freewheeling 1970s, before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which aimed to export Shia zeal into the Sunni Arab world. From then on, Saudi’s rulers enforced a rigid interpretation of Sunni Islam – one that had been widely practised across the Arabian peninsula since the 18th century, the era of cleric Muhammed ibn Abdul Wahhab. In 1744, Abdul Wahhab had made a pact with the then ruler Mohammed bin Saud, allowing his family to run affairs of state while hardline clerics defined the national character.The modern day kingdom, proclaimed in 1932, left both sides – the clerics and the rulers – too powerful to take the other on, locking the state and its citizens into a society defined by arch-conservative views: the strict segregation of non-related men and women uncompromising gender roles an intolerance of other faiths and an unfailing adherence to doctrinal teachings, all rubber-stamped by the House of Saud.Many believe this alliance directly contributed to the rise of global terrorism. Al-Qaida’s worldview – and that of its offshoot, Islamic State (Isis) – were largely shaped by Wahhabi scriptures and Saudi clerics were widely accused of encouraging a jihadist movement that grew throughout the 1990s, with Osama bin Laden at its centre.In 2018, Saudi’s new leadership wants to draw a line under this era and introduce what bin Salman calls “moderate Islam”. This he sees as essential to the survival of a state where a large, restless and often disaffected young population has, for nearly four decades, had little access to entertainment, a social life or inidual freedoms. Saudi’s new rulers believe such rigid societal norms, enforced by clerics, could prove fodder for extremists who tap into such feelings of frustration.Reform is beginning to creep through many aspects of Saudi society among the most visible was June’s lifting of the ban on women drivers. There have been changes to the labour markets and a bloated public sector cinemas have opened, and an anti-corruption drive launched across the private sector and some quarters of government. The government also claims to have stopped all funding to Wahhabi institutions outside the kingdom, which had been supported with missionary zeal for nearly four decades.Such radical shock therapy is slowly being absorbed across the country, where communities conditioned to decades of uncompromising doctrine don’t always know what to make of it. Contradictions abound: some officials and institutions eschew conservatism, while others wholeheartedly embrace it. Meanwhile, political freedoms remain off-limits power has become more centralised and dissent is routinely crushed.Bin Laden’s legacy remains one of the kingdom’s most pressing issues. I meet Prince Turki al-Faisal, who was the head of Saudi intelligence for 24 years, between 1977 and 1 September 2001 (10 days before the 911 attacks), at his villa in Jeddah. An erudite man now in his mid-70s, Turki wears green cufflinks bearing the Saudi flag on the sleeves of his thobe. “There are two Osama bin Ladens,” he tells me. “One before the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and one after it. Before, he was very much an idealistic mujahid. He was not a fighter. By his own admission, he fainted during a battle, and when he woke up, the Soviet assault on his position had been defeated.”As Bin Laden moved from Afghanistan to Sudan, and as his links to Saudi Arabia soured, it was Turki who spoke with him on behalf of the kingdom. In the wake of 911, these direct dealings came under intense scrutiny. Then – and 17 years later – relatives of some of the 2,976 killed and more than 6,000 wounded in New York and Washington DC refuse to believe that a country that had exported such an arch-conservative form of the faith could have nothing to do with the consequences.“He had a poker face,” Turki continues. “He never grimaced, or smiled. In 1992, 1993, there was a huge meeting in Peshawar organised by Nawaz Sharif’s government.” Bin Laden had by this point been given refuge by Afghan tribal leaders. “There was a call for Muslim solidarity, to coerce those leaders of the Muslim world to stop going at each other’s throats. I also saw him there. Our eyes met, but we didn’t talk. He didn’t go back to the kingdom. He went to Sudan, where he built a honey business and financed a road.”Bin Laden’s advocacy increased in exile. “He used to fax statements to everybody. He was very critical. There were efforts by the family to dissuade him – emissaries and such – but they were unsuccessful. It was probably his feeling that he was not taken seriously by the government.”By 1996, Bin Laden was back in Afghanistan. Turki says the kingdom knew it had a problem and wanted him returned. He flew to Kandahar to meet with the then head of the Taliban, Mullah Omar. “He said, ‘I am not averse to handing him over, but he was very helpful to the Afghan people.’ He said Bin Laden was granted refuge according to Islamic dictates.” Two years later, in September 1998, Turki flew again to Afghanistan, this time to be robustly rebuffed. “At that meeting, he was a changed man,” he says of Omar. “Much more reserved, sweating profusely. Instead of taking a reasonable tone, he said, ‘How can you persecute this worthy man who dedicated his life to helping Muslims?’” Turki says he warned Omar that what he was doing would harm the people of Afghanistan, and left.The family visit to Kandahar took place the following year, and came after a US missile strike on one of Bin Laden’s compounds – a response to al-Qaida attacks on US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. It seems an entourage of immediate family had little trouble finding their man, where the Saudi and western intelligence networks could not.According to officials in Riyadh, London and Washington DC, Bin Laden had by then become the world’s number one counter-terrorism target, a man who was bent on using Saudi citizens to drive a wedge between eastern and western civilisations. “There is no doubt that he deliberately chose Saudi citizens for the 911 plot,” a British intelligence officer tells me. “He was convinced that was going to turn the west against his ... home country. He did indeed succeed in inciting a war, but not the one he expected.”Turki claims that in the months before 911, his intelligence agency knew that something troubling was being planned. “In the summer of 2001, I took one of the warnings about something spectacular about to happen to the Americans, British, French and Arabs. We didn’t know where, but we knew that something was being brewed.”Bin Laden remains a popular figure in some parts of the country, lauded by those who believe he did God’s work. The depth of support, however, is difficult to gauge. What remains of his immediate family, meanwhile, has been allowed back into the kingdom: at least two of Osama’s wives (one of whom was with him in Abbottabad when he was killed by US special forces) and their children now live in Jeddah.Osama’s mother rejoins the conversation. “I speak to his harem most weeks,” she says. “They live nearby.”Osama’s half-sister, and the two men’s sister, Fatima al-Attas, was not at our meeting. From her home in Paris, she later emailed to say she strongly objected to her mother being interviewed, asking that it be rearranged through her. Despite the blessing of her brothers and stepfather, she felt her mother had been pressured into talking. Ghanem, however, insisted she was happy to talk and could have talked longer. It is, perhaps, a sign of the extended family’s complicated status in the kingdom that such tensions exist.I ask the family about Bin Laden’s youngest son, 29-year-old Hamza, who is thought to be in Afghanistan. Last year, he was officially designated a “global terrorist” by the US and appears to have taken up the mantle of his father, under the auspices of al-Qaida’s new leader, and Osama’s former deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.His uncles shake their heads. “We thought everyone was over this,” Hassan says. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.’” Hamza bin Laden’s continued rise may well cloud the family’s attempts to shake off their past. It may also hinder the crown prince’s efforts to shape a new era in which Bin Laden is cast as a generational aberration, and in which the hardline doctrines once sanctioned by the kingdom no longer offer legitimacy to extremism. While change has been attempted in Saudi Arabia before, it has been nowhere near as extensive as the current reforms. How hard Mohammed bin Salman can push against a society indoctrinated in such an uncompromising worldview remains an open question.Saudia Arabia’s allies are optimistic, but offer a note of caution. The British intelligence officer I spoke to told me, “If Salman doesn’t break through, there will be many more Osamas. And I’m not sure they’ll be able to shake the curse.” Translation by Nadia al-Faour• If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).

Business executive Grainne O’Hara, who worked at a subsidiary of the meat producer Kepak, was awarded €7,500 by the Labour Court over being required to deal with out-of-hours work emails, even after midnight. The extra burden led to her working in excess of 48 hours a week.How is work defined? Under the Act, “working time” means\u0026nbspany period during which the worker is working, at the employer’s disposal and carrying out hisher activity or duties. This would include dealing with emails and phone calls.What does a maximum average working week mean? The 48 hours may be averaged according to the following rules: For employees, generally over four months. For employees where work is seasonal, subject to a foreseeable surge in activity, or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of service or production, it may be averaged over six months.For employees who enter into a collective agreement with their employees which is approved by the Labour Court, the period is 12 months.The maximum 48-hour working week was phased in over three years following the commencement of the 1997 Act. During the first year, from March 1st 1998, employees were permitted to work up to 60 hours a week. In the second year, a 55-hour week was permitted, subject to a requirement that employees sign a written agreement with their employers.What other rights are stipulated in the legislation? The Act also provides that, from March 1st 1998, every employee “shall be entitled to a rest period of not less than 11 consecutive hours in each period of 24 hours during which he or she works for his or her employer”.Do the rest periods apply to all employees? No. They don’t apply to those engaged in sea fishing or in other work at sea. They also don’t apply to those employed by a relative where their workplace is in the private house or farm on which he or she and the relative reside.What other rest breaks are employees entitled to? A weekly rest period of 24 consecutive hours per seven days, following a daily rest period. They are also entitled to a 15-minute break where more than 4½ hours have been worked and a 30-minute break where more than 6 hours have been worked, which may include the first break.What holidays are employees entitled to? All employees, regardless of status or service, qualify for paid holidays. All time worked also qualifies for paid holiday time.The Act contains provisions regarding the calculation of holiday pay and places an obligation on the employer to ensure that an employee takes their full statutory leave within the leave year, or within the six months after that.Employees are also entitled to an unbroken period of two weeks’ holidays after eight months’ work.What about public holidays? There are nine public holidays a year. Workers are entitled to one of the following: a paid day off on the day, a paid day off within a month of that day, an additional day of annual leave, or an additional day’s pay, whichever of those is determined by the employer."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Weinstein rape accuser told him \u0026#39I love you\u0026#39 in emails released by mogul\u0026#39s defenceComment: Think the heatwave is just a mild inconvenience?

In South America, the large-bodied lizards range widely east of the Andes and include species such as the Argentine black and white tegu.Armed with strong jaws and tails that they can wield as thumping weapons, the lizards in Florida devour the eggs of American alligators and ground-nesting birds, wildlife officials said. The reptiles also have a taste for insects, fruit and birds.As far as being a damaging invasive species, it really depends on what the threatened resources are in the areas where you might get tegus, said Robert Reed, chief of the Invasive Species Science Branch at the US Geological Survey, and another report co-author.Tegu owners describe their pets as big, calm and occasionally affectionate lizards that like sunning themselves and are not picky about what they eat. But they can also be ornery and tough to handle.In Florida, local wild populations of breeding tegu lizards are found in at least two counties, Miami-Dade and Hillsborough, home to Tampa, while there have been sightings in other parts of the state, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.On private lands, Florida hunters without a license are allowed to kill tegu lizards if it is done humanely. On public lands, the state is trying to get rid of the lizards through traps.The most important thing that the public can do to stop the spread of nonnative species like tegus is to NEVER release nonnative animals into the wild, commission specialist Jamie Rager said in an email.

The Irish cancellations alone will affect around 3,500 passengers.The airline is yet to specify how many other flights will be cancelled due to the other strikes.Ryanair said it has notified all customers affected and is providing refunds or alternative flights.The latest action comes as the airline has been hit with a series of pilot and cabin crew strikes over the last weeks.Ryanair CEO Michael O\u0026#39Leary has said it could move some of its Irish fleet to Poland of the disruption continuesNext Friday is the fifth strike by Irish pilots since July 12 and Ryanair has proposed third-party mediation with the Irish union Forsa to help end the dispute. A proposal the union has today accepted.Ryanair’s Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: “This 5th strike notice by Forsa is irresponsible, unwarranted and is disrupting customers and (a way of damaging) Ryanair’s business and our share price.He added: “We apologise sincerely to the 3,500 Irish customers whose flights next Fri 10 Aug will be disrupted because Forsa won’t meet us to resolve this dispute, even though we have agreed 9 of Forsa’s 11 requirements.”In response, Forsa has accused Ryanair of “rewording” some of its demands and effectively “negotiating with itself rather than the pilot representatives”.Tensions with Irish pilots were inflamed earlier this week when Ryanair’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, threatened to move part of the Irish fleet to Poland if the disruption continued.He said: “If some market is being damaged as the Irish market has been damaged in recent months by these activities, the Polish market is growing hugely strongly for us, the Ryanair Sun is very full, profitable, we need more aircraft in the Polish market - move aircraft to Poland.”Ryanair is facing a summer of industrial unrest after it reversed decades of policy last year to said it would officially recognise unions.The move came after cabin crew and pilots threatened a number of strikes over the Christmas period in a bid to get improved conditions.While the airline has recognised some unions in larger countries such as the UK, negotiations have stalled in some smaller countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands.Please review our commenting policyWeinstein rape accuser told him \u0026#39I love you\u0026#39 in emails released by mogul\u0026#39s defenceComment: Think the heatwave is just a mild inconvenience?

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil? Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

The cutting-edge study sheds a remarkable light on the geographical origins of the Neolithic community that first constructed the ancient site.Complex tests carried out on 25 Neolithic people who were buried at or following the time of the initial construction of the now world-famous monument, have revealed that 10 of them lived nowhere near Stonehenge, but in western Britain, and that half of those 10 potentially came from southwest Wales (where the earliest Stonehenge monoliths came from).The other 15 could be local to Stonehenge, Wiltshire-origin iniduals, or the children of\u0026nbspother descendants of migrants from the west. All the remains were cremations.Up until now, it has always been assumed that it was not possible to carry out place-of-origin tests on burned bones – but recent research at Oxford University by\u0026nbspBelgian scientist, Dr Christophe Snoeck of the Free University of Brussels, has now discovered that the act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and prevents the crucial origin-indicating isotope evidence from being contaminated by isotopic signals in the surrounding soil.The cremated remains from Stonehenge of the 10 iniduals of probable western British origin, were buried at various stages between the 33rd\u0026nbspcentury BC and the 28th century BC.UCL)Half of them (mainly from the 33rd-30th century BC) were probably from west Wales, while others (mainly from the 30th-28th century BC) were probably associated with places between west Wales and Gloucestershire. It’s likely that they were a\u0026nbsproughly even mix of males and females and that they were of high social status. In all the cases, it is not known whether the iniduals died shortly before all or parts of their cremated remains were transported to Stonehenge – or whether they were revered ancestors who had died several generations earlier.Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.Stonehenge: Origins of those who built world-famous monument revealed A new scientific research collaboration is, for the first time, revealing who built Stonehenge.

The cutting-edge study sheds a remarkable light on the geographical origins of the Neolithic community that first constructed the ancient site.26 Three of the cremated cranial fragments used in the study Up until now, it has always been assumed that it was not possible to carry out place-of-origin tests on burned bones – but recent research at Oxford University by Belgian scientist, Dr Christophe Snoeck of the Free University of Brussels, has now discovered that the act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and prevents the crucial origin-indicating isotope evidence from being contaminated by isotopic signals in the surrounding soil.36 Aubrey Hole 7 during excavation in 2008 Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported.

The carbon signal, absorbed into the bones from the timber used in the funerary pyre, also suggests a Western or non-local origin.Geologically, previous research has shown that the stones (so-called bluestones or dolerite, used for the early phase of Stonehenge) also came from western Britain (in this case, the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales).

Now we are beginning to make tremendous progress in understanding the people and the community which built Stonehenge,” said the project’s osteologist, Christina Willis of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology.The research was carried out by archaeologists and other scientists from the University of Oxford, UCL, the Free University of Brussels, and the Museum of Natural History in Paris and is being published\u0026nbsptoday by the online\u0026nbspjournal\u0026nbspNature Scientific Reports.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.UCL)Firstly, it demonstrates the extremely broad geographical horizons that the builders of Stonehenge had. It shows that, despite agriculture increasingly tying people to the land, at least certain sections of society were well travelled and almost certainly had family connections spread across thousands of square miles.Secondly, it shows the lengths that prehistoric people were prepared to go to achieve seemingly non-utilitarian objectives – i.e. the realisation of spiritual or ceremonial aspirations.Thirdly, it suggests the possibility that the western origin of Stonehenge was so\u0026nbspimportant and memorable that it was celebrated across the millennia through collective memory and epic storytelling passed on across the generations. Potential evidence of this is\u0026nbspthe Arthurian story of the magician Merlin, who transports the stones of Stonehenge from the west. The\u0026nbspMerlin story describes how the stones\u0026nbspcame from Ireland – but southwest Wales is certainly close enough to Ireland, and also has\u0026nbspimportant Irish connections. The story was first written during the medieval times – but may well have had its roots in prehistoric collective memory.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/11/11/gettyimages-971480544.jpg","title":"sadiq khan theresa may housing policy rent deposit fees london","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Rising rents, ongoing insecurity, and in too many cases poor quality housing make the 2.4 million private renters in London amongst those worst-affected by the housing crisis\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsLondon mayor says ministers \u0027are in danger of opening the door to an entirely new culture of exploitation\u0027Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has criticised Theresa May\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbsp“watering down” proposals to combat “rip off” tenancy fees and deposits for renters.In a\u0026nbspjoint letter to the prime minister, alongside the organisations Crisis, Generation Rent and Citizens UK, Mr Khan claims a key piece of legislation making its way through parliament – designed to ban agents’ fees – contains an alarming loophole.He says letting agents could still end up “charging excessive” and “spurious” fees spread throughout a tenancy, rather than charged upfront as is the case at present.

A quarter of respondents were neutral on the idea and 16 per cent replied don’t know.The findings suggested that 40 per cent of people would welcome experiments of the proposal in their local area to test how it works, while 15 per cent were opposed. A further 27 per cent said they did not oppose or support the idea.The poll also found that the\u0026nbspmajority of the public back a welfare state guided most\u0026nbspby concern for the poor and needy (54 per cent) rather than “stepping out of the way so people can stand on their own two feet” (5 per cent).Nearly half (49 per cent) believed basic income would also reduce the stigma associated with receiving benefits. But the polling also reveals that the\u0026nbsppublic is concerned about the cost, with 45 per cent worrying it is “unaffordable”.Anthony\u0026nbspPainter, the director of the RSA’s action and research centre, said: “The universal credit experiment is failing on its own terms, while the wider welfare state is riddled with complexities and underpinned by draconian sanctions.“By contrast, our poll shows that in an era of widespread economic insecurity, policymakers have the public’s support to start exploring innovative alternatives to today’s failing and unpopular welfare system.“Basic income is no magic bullet, but with HM opposition exploring the idea and the Scottish government looking to pilot it with four Scottish councils, basic income is increasingly seen as one plausible response to modern economic insecurity.”The author of the report, Charlie Young, added: “As basic income schemes are tested and designed, we need to give thought to how they meet people’s\u0026nbspneeds and natural concerns. This poll shows there’s net support for basic income in principle\u0026nbspand that there’s an appetite for experimentation.”Labour’s finer details are yet to be laid out, but the trial in Finland, in which 2,000 participants took part, involved them receiving €560 (£490) monthly basic payment, equivalent to £5,880 a year.Mr McDonnell revealed to The Independent earlier this week that he had recently discussed the idea with former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was “really keen” on getting a pilot of the scheme in the next manifesto.Asked whether he could envisage a pilot of basic income forming part of Labour’s next blueprint for government, he replied: “It’s one of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto and see, it’s worth a try. There have been pilots elsewhere. I’m trying to wait for the feedback.”He continued: “If you look at what’s happened elsewhere in other countries – and I think Scotland is looking at it as well – they are doing it on a small geographical basis in particular towns. Guy is looking at that now and coming forward with proposals.“It will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto – that’s one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.”A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: A universal basic income would not work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities. We currently spend £90 billion a year on welfare support tailored to the needs of iniduals, which means more help is getting to the people who need it most.“It’s reasonable for people to meet certain requirements to receive their universal credit payment and these are agreed with people in advance – sanctions are only used in the minority of cases when someone doesn’t meet these requirements without a good reason.”Populus interviewed a random sample of 2,070 UK adults aged 18+ online between 27–29 of July 2018.\u0026nbspSurveys were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.\u0026nbspPopulus is a founder member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rulesThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/28/13/american-airlines.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/28/13/american-airlines.jpg","title":"goats boise idaho west loose goat where animal control","story":"Created with Sketch.The goats have caused chaos and confusion while destroying front gardensClick to followThe Independent USNearly 100 goats mysteriously descend on Boise: \u0027No one is exactly sure where they came from\u0027Dozens of goats have mysteriously descended upon a suburban town in Idaho, destroying lawns and chewing rose bushes to shreds.\u0026nbspIt was a scene of chaos and confusion: nearly 100 goats on a street in\u0026nbspWest Boise, Idaho on early Friday morning, calmly walking from one house to the next as they ate foliage and plants.\u0026nbspJoe Parris, a local reporter for KTVB, described the situation in front of a front yard flocked by goats for the morning news: This is just a bunch of goats that showed up in this neighbourhood\u0026nbsphere this morning … no one is exactly sure where they came from.They\u0027re just going yard to yard, eating everyone’s front lawn,\u0026nbsphe wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspWest Boise animal control, which did not respond to enquiries, arrived to the scene with just one truck before heading back for more resources.The Boise police department also did not respond to requests for comment, but appeared to be aware of the situation.

Some of it is common sense.It makes no sense that ferry or rail passengers don’t have to give the same basic info to the Authorities as plane arrivals do.It should go without saying that failed asylum seekers should be sent home quickly, without endless costly judicial reviews at taxpayers’ expense.And to avoid another Windrush scandal we must give official papers to those who have been here for years — especially Ugandan Asians, who came in the ’70s and are most likely to be without. Other recommendations require a bit more thought.But at least Policy Exchange are doing some thinking about Britain’s future. On the other hand, the Government is turning drift into an art form.  Even the much-ballyhoed, super-charged no deal plans that were supposed to be released one-by-one this summer are being quietly shuffled away until one day in late August.Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker is right to be “alarmed and worried” .The PM’s Chequers fudge is a direct result of our lack of planning, and until we’re ready to go it alone, Brussels will force us to make more concessions.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism. Jezza even risks losing his beloved allotment in Jewish-voting Barnet.What will it now take for decent Labour MPs like Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper to admit Labour is not fit under Corbyn to be an alternative party of government?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

(Answers at the foot of the page).Big Narstie, who began his chat show run by announcing: “First things first, I just want to say ‘Channel 4, you f***ed up’.”And he really wasn’t kidding.WANT to know what it’s like to be a cocker spaniel, locked in a Nissan Micra for two hours on Southend ­seafront? Try watching BBC2’s Stewart Lee: Content Provider, which was recorded live at the town’sPalace Theatre, in April. You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well. Stupid f***ing c***s.”Good luck selling out the O2, Stew.Mystery objects round, as described by Stacey Solomon’s son Zachary: “They’re louder than like a car beeping. They’re very annoying. Some people are scared of them. When they poo it’s really soggy, green, white and black. Their legs are skinny, their body’s fat.“One day Mum turned into one of them and . . . ”The Loose Women?Emailed in by Kieran Jackson.Picture research: Alfie Snelling.MORTIFICATION was piled upon embarrassment and painful discomfort last week as three of the mad old bats from Our Shirley Valentine Summer went speed dating in an Athens hotel.A romantic disaster that involved Annabel Giles, Sian Lloyd and Ninia Benjamin, who, I’m guessing, are no one’s first choices for the next Charlie’s Angels re-boot.But they probably had the viewers’ sympathy, as the three Greek blokes looked like they’d just slid down the side of Mount Olympus in an old ­bathtub. All gappy leers, awkward silences and ill-fitting brown suits, this lot were. My word, though, after the briefest of mobile phone interruptions, the sexual chemistry was fair zinging between Annabel Giles and her first date.“Was that your mum?”“No, my mum is dead.”“I’m probably the same age as your mum. How old is she?” She’s still dead, Annabel.If anything though, romantic developments were even less promising back at the girls’ villa on Naxos, where we learnt: “A goat escaped its pen and spent the night in Ingrid Tarrant’s room. There’s poo everywhere.”Whether the poo belonged to the goat or Ingrid, I’m still not 100 per cent sure, but I’m hoping the local match-maker flagged up “a potential bowel issue” with her first date, George, an absolute ringer forHarvey Weinstein, whose background caused a surprising amount of excitement.“He lives in Crete,” Ingrid squealed down the phone to her daughter.“So do they call them Cretins?” Only if he asks for a second date, Ingrid (ITV, Thursday, 9pm).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities? What about the destruction of trust in democracy? The inevitable breakdown of law and order? Would riots bother them?

Or see the “hand of Israel” behind Islamist murder. Or call Hamas terrorists “brother” after they have helped slaughter Jews.Or discipline two veteran MPs who accused him over anti-semitism . . . but not an actual anti-semite in Willsman.This is the dark heart of the man Labour wants to install in Downing Street.We don’t just mean the hard-left muppets on his front bench.

We see no prospect of a deal with leaders like that.WELL done, Theresa May, for insisting on Brit-only passport lanes post-Brexit.We don’t want to hear Home Office gripes about cost, or UK-only lanes being slower than others.

For having believed the “lies” of the Brexit campaign.But it is hard to imagine anyone could be quite so stupid as to really believe we’ll be short of food if we tell our European friends to shove their deal where the sun doesn’t shine.They even had a debate on Remainer Central (that’s BBC Newsnight to you and me) about what we could put in our sandwiches if we fail to sign a deal. Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know. We’re just leaving an undemocratic bureaucracy.Do these dingbats really think that the Spanish tomato growers and the Dutch pig farmers are going to refuse to sell us anything? Or that we would refuse to buy their produce? Get real.The debate about whether we should leave or remain in the EU was pretty shoddy. There was exaggeration and outlandish claims made by both sides.I never believed the rubbish about an extra £350million a week for the NHS. And if I’d thought we were going to do that I’d probably have voted Remain. If ever there was a waste of money, that would be it.The difference is, the Remainers believe all the crap that’s spouted by their side. Every bit of it.Just as they believed the economy would be wrecked within a week of the vote. When actually it has been doing very well indeed and is projected to do even better.Sky fallen in yet? Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations.

It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson?

That scandal has been exposed by actual journalists.In fact Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, almost wrecked the trial of some accused of serious crime, thus potentially denying both them and their alleged victims justice.Yesterday he was freed on appeal over his contempt of court. Supporters say he was locked up too hastily and for too long. But he was already serving a suspended sentence for the same offence.His many convictions stretch from violence to fraud. We have no sympathy.The case he jeopardised in Leeds had reporting restrictions, temporarily preventing details being publicised. They’re neither unusual nor a politically-correct cover-up. They’re to avoid prejudicing and collapsing other trials linked to it.Robinson blatantly flouted them, was in contempt — and admitted it.Yes, our legal system IS too secretive. On this occasion it was crucial in the interests of justice.It’s time his supporters grasped it.WHAT a surprise.

He should listen to the Jewish community and apologise for the huge offence and distress the party has caused under his leadership.Then he should adopt the full IHRA definition and all its examples, respond properly to the reasonable requests made by by the JLC and the BoD and third, act much more quickly to boot racists out of the party. Boot them out.”The Labour leader even went on to say that some Jews didnt want a Jewish stateLater in the interview, Corbyn went on to say that many Jews didn’t actually want a Jewish state.He added: “Post war there was an obvious guilt about the treatment of Jewish people and whilst a number of Jewish people did manage to flee Nazi Germany and settle in the United States or here in Britain or in other countries, a lot didn’t.“This then married up with a much earlier Zionist demand for the establishment of a Jewish state, which was actually opposed by quite a lot of Jewish people who didn’t want a Jewish state, they wanted Jewish identity and they wanted their right to Jewish identity in London or Moscow or Berlin or anywhere else and that state was established.”A Labour spokesman said: “Jeremy stated the following facts: Britain made promises to both Jews and Arabs during and at the end of the First World War, some of which cut across each other the founding of the State of Israel led to the forced exile of part of the Palestinian population there was always opposition to the idea of a Jewish state by some Jews.”The Balfour Declaration was issued during World War One to announce support for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.The declaration was made in a letter from the UK’s then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community.It was drafted by Conservative MP Leo Amery, who was then Cabinet Secretary.It stated: “His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”It was the first expression of public support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine by a major political power and became a pivotal moment in the movement.Last year the Labour leader was criticised for turning down an invitation to join Theresa May and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at a dinner in London to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Balfour Declaration.Shadow Foreign secretary Emily Thornberry attended in his place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re going to have to do the hard negotiating in Brussels”.He added: “The problem with no deal is they read our own media, and they see it can’t be done”.Business chiefs heaped pressure on Mrs May to cut a deal with a warning that one in five companies would consider relocating to the EU if her Brexit negotiation fails.The Institute of Directors also calls on the Government to speed up publication of its no deal guidance, which has been delayed until the end of this month.Its new survey of 800 business leaders also reveals less than a third have conducted any Brexit contingency planning.IOD Director General Stephen Martin said: “Many companies are still unprepared for Brexit, and it’s hard to blame them.“When it comes to knowing what to plan for and when, firms have been left in the dark.”Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: “With the prospect of a no-deal growing day by day, so too are concerns about financial instability and fears of job losses.“This can be avoided if people are given the final say on Brexit, with the option to remain.”Despite what sneering Remainers claim, Britain is an equal in these negotiations. Let’s act like it.Our huge economic power, and the might of the City and its importance to the EU, give us enormous clout if only Theresa May would wield it.First SHE must believe in it. She must sell Brexit to the public as the golden opportunity it is, to make Britain a prosperous independent country out in the wider world where 90 per cent of future growth will take place.We have a vast ocean of talent. We have nine universities in the world’s top 50, dwarfing the rest of Europe combined. The EU fears our success.The PM will never talk round the ­hysterical “People’s Vote” brigade clamouring to annul the first People’s Vote they lost in 2016. But millions of more sensible folk are ready to be enthused about creating a new partnership both with the EU AND the rest of the world.All they currently hear are unchallenged and absurd Remainer scares about the dire consequences of Brexit, especially a no-deal on WTO rules.None of it should hold any fear for us.And being ready for no-deal, mentally and physically, is vital to get from the EU what we always wanted: a trade deal that frees us from Brussels.The Government must get off its knees, fight for Britain and unite it behind Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

after the North Pole and Bermuda Triangle.And while theres no concrete evidence to support this, some say navigational instruments are often affected in waters surrounding Es Vedrà.There’s also the popular belief that Es Vedrà was used to build the Pyramids in Egypt, as the limestone rock is claimed to hold a maximum concentration of enery, similar to that of the Pyramids, Stonehenge and Easter Island.However, due to there being no traces of quarrying, it is plausible that legend came about because of the mysterious force that people feel surrounds the area, which has made it a favourite location for meditation.Other legends are that it’s the home of the sirens and sea nymphs who tried to lure Ulysses from his ship in Homer’s Odyssey.While others believe there to be a secret UFO base under Es Vedrà and that the rock is their gateway and navigation beacon.A sighting known as Caso Manises claims on November 22, 1979, a flight between Mallorca and Tenerife was redirected to make an emergency landing after the pilot reported strange and rapid flashes of lights hitting his aircraft as he travelled over Es Vedrà.He sent out an SOS signal and, as the air traffic controller was unable to identify the lights or objects, he was urged to change the flight path.Reports of odd objects and circles of light emerging from the sea by local fishermen have only added to the belief that it’s a hub for aliens.Another popular myth is that it is the tip of the sunken civilisation of Atlantis, mainly due to its proximity to the sandstone quarry of Sa Pedrera on the island which saw hippies flock to inhabit a cave there in the 1960s.Celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Rita Ora, Alessandra Ambrosio, Victoria’s Secret model Elsa Hosk, Millie Mackintosh and actress Ruby Rose have all been snapped at the beauty spot, which has become a favourite destination to be photographed on social media this summer.Most people view the rock from a viewing platform accessed via a steep 20-minute hike.But its not easy to get to there’s a make-shift car park at the bottom of a winding road and it’s a 40-minute drive from the main tourist hub of San Antonio.Others hire a boat to try and get closer to the rock itself, though it’s impossible to get close enough to step foot on it due to the crashing waves."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000132160445.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"osama bin laden mum family wealth saudi arabia 9 11 pictures","story":"Alia Ghanem’s plush home in Saudi capital Jeddah is decorated with framed pictures of the terrorist mastermind who was shot dead by US special forces in 2011.The bin Laden family remains one of Saudi Arabia’s richest dynasties, thanks to their construction empire, and their movements remain closely monitored by the regime.Speaking with , Ghanem called her Al Qaeda leader son a “very good kid who loved me so much.Her mansion includes a large spiral staircase at its centrepiece which leads to a number of cavernous rooms, according to the report.Despite Osama singlehandedly ruining the family name, his mother’s home features framed pictures of the depraved jihadi killer.One of the mementos sits on the mantelpiece showing the mass murderer with a long beard and wearing a military jacket.She describes her first born as being “shy” and “pious” when he was in his early 20s.The matriarch, dressed in a red hijab, blames extremists at the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah for “brainwashing” her son.She said: “The people at university changed him.

Mainly because this decision - highly symbolic as it might be - was actually unusually uncontroversial. Every one of the nine MPC members voted for it - the first time there has been unanimity for a rate increase in more than a decade.The move was widely anticipated in financial markets. And the Bank said that while it would take a tiny bit off economic growth, it was unlikely to leave a major dent in the economy. Many people within the economy fraternity have spent the past decade or so fretting about what higher interest rates would do to households. Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it?In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal.The message seems to have been received.On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs.For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-margaret-hodge-labour_4379601.jpg?20180803163614 ","title":"labour making rules up in margaret hodge investigation mps lawyers claim","story":"In her letters to Dame Margaret\u0027s lawyers, Ms Formby hit back at a \"fishing expedition\" for information about the investigation.She said: \"Should this investigation proceed further, it will do so in a fair and proportionate manner.\"That will include putting further information to her about the allegations against her at the appropriate stage.\"Dame Margaret\u0027s lawyers claim she remains unaware what acts she is under investigation for, the nature of complaints made against her and the timeline of the probe.They warned: \"You must now either proceed with the investigation, or bring it to a close.

I’m doing so because I believe that, over the last two years, our political leaders have let all of us down, whether we voted for or against Brexit. Two years ago, immediately after the referendum, we were told by both sides that the decision to leave was the biggest thing to hit the United Kingdom since the Second World War. It was a crisis, and what do we do in times of crisis? We come together. That is what we should have done. There should have been a cross-party and inclusive group to conduct the negotiations and we should have worked on a proposal that would, at the minimum, have appealed to a majority of those who voted in the referendum.  The last general election even returned a hung Parliament – a sign that the people did not think one party could do this on its own. Instead, what Theresa May has done is to limit the debate to the agenda of warring factions inside her own party. Everyone else – all of us – has been shut out. In the last two years we have seen no progress and, in that time, a whole new generation of voters, who were not allowed to vote two years ago, have now become eligible but have been forced to watch while their future is debated in front of them and they have no say whatsoever.

It comes five years after a legal fight over the Tories\u0027 hated \u0027workfare\u0027 schemes - which forced jobseekers to work for free or have their benefits docked.  The saga began in 2013, when graduate Cait Reilly won a Court of Appeal victory over her unpaid work placement in Poundland.  Judges found the government had not described its back-to-work schemes in enough detail when establishing them in 2011. So an emergency law was passed in 2013 to make the schemes legal - and stop Tory ministers having to refund \u0026pound130million to those who\u0027d had their benefits sanctioned.  It later emerged, however, that the 2013 legal change had led to thousands of appeals by jobseekers being unsuccessful. A court found this group of jobseekers had lost their right to a fair hearing under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Now the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has drafted changes to the 2013 law to make it legal and refund those who were affected.   Details released under the Freedom of Information Act show between 3,789 and 4,305 people are expected to be paid back \u0026pound1.7m to \u0026pound1.9m in lost benefits.  The DWP emphasised this was an initial estimate that is subject to change.  Officials also said the DWP will only repay a very specific, small group - people who:  Had been sanctioned on jobseekers\u0027 allowance, AND Had a live appeal on the tribunal system on 26 Match 2013, AND The appeal related to compliance with the 2011 laws that outlined \u0027workfare\u0027 schemes, or the referral notification letters they received.  Campaigners today said the payments do not go far enough. Blogger Frank Zola, who obtained the DWP estimates, called for all those who\u0027d been sanctioned under the original schemes to be refunded the full \u0026pound130million. Darren Richards of the Boycott Workfare campaign told the Mirror people were placed in an unlawful situation by politically-motivated policy.  There is a moral duty to refund everyone involved, he added, as people have died from being sanctioned - highlighting the tragic case of David Clapson.

The Cabinet minister, whose job is to care for the environment, came up with possibly the most Michael Gove silver lining to climate change ever in a speech yesteday. He said: I was in East Sussex the weekend before last, talking to someone there who built a farm and turned it into a highly successful business producing English sparkling wine. One of the challenges - or opportunities, dare I say - of a changing climate is that chalky soil of parts of England, combined with the weather we just had, means that English sparkling wine will have a bumper harvest this year. Mr Gove was taking part in a debate at BBC Countryfile Live in Oxford.  Speaking to an audience of farming and environmental experts, he said the product pointed to the resilience and joie de vivre that can be found in Britain. The wine in question, which he later revealed was produced at the Rathfinny Estate in East Sussex, has been independently assessed as being higher quality and better tasting than the finest champagne from France, he said.  He added: So whatever else Brexit may bring, it will bring English sparkling wine, providing a level of cheer to British drinkers, greater than that provided by the French champagne.  The politician said it was an example of the inventiveness, the creativity, the resilience, imagination and sheer joie de vivre you can find in Britain.

There’s no better time to explore the very best of the Great British coastline, so pack up the beach toys, grab the sunscreen and get going. Get prepped before you go Before you set off, consider getting a Free Car Check at Halfords to put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too. Pembrey Sands, Wales  Located inside the Pembrey Country Park, this coastal highlight has eight miles of beach and something for everyone. Enjoy the sands in the morning and then head into the woodland for some shade in the afternoon. There are activities here, too, including cycling opportunities, a dry ski slope and an adventure playground. There’s also a campsite if you need a place to pitch your tent for the night. If you don\u0027t already have a tent and you\u0027re not sure where to start, check out the Halfords Tent Selector which will help you find the tent which best suits your needs.

A miniature railway will appeal to kids but also provides a great way to get from the town to the beach during peak season. An adventure playground will keep the little ones busy while you wait for the train. Before you leave the car though, make sure you install the Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield, \u0026pound7.99 – it will help keep the temperature in your car down while it\u0027s parked in the coastal sun. Wells-next-the-Sea beach is part of the Holkham Estate and the nearby nature reserve consists of nearly 10,000 acres. There\u0027s loads of important nature here, with salt marshes, sand dunes and pine trees – originally planted to help protect the dunes.  Pack the Halfords Beach Hut 4 Pole Compact Windbreak (above), \u0026pound45 - it\u0027s perfect for carrying to the beach as it comes in a short carry bag with each pole in three sections ready the snap together. Kynance Cove, Cornwall  Kynance Cove isn’t the biggest beach that Cornwall has to offer, but the giant rocks that pepper the beach and caves worn into the rock by the turquoise sea make it well worth a visit. There are cliff walks all around the area, too.  A day on the beach, walking and exploring, can be thirsty work. The Halfords 40 Litre Mains and 12V \u0026amp 24V Electric Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (shown above) is easy to lug about thanks to durable wheels and a pull out handle.  The coolbox is able to cool up to 16 degrees C below the ambient temperature ensuring that your drinks and snacks are kept cool even on a warm day. It can be powered either from 240V mains or by a 12V in-car or 24v in-truck cigarette plug.  Durdle Door Beach, Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of Dorset and Devon that has 185 million years of geological history. The first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton was found there my Mary Anning and her brother Joseph – she found the torso after he had found the skull a year previously. If your kids are into dinosaurs and natural history, this is the place to visit. Durdle Door Beach offers views of the famous limestone arch just off the coast. The beach itself is accessed by a fairly challenging set of stairs cut into the cliff, so bear in mind it won\u0027t be suitable for very young children or pushchairs. Consider Lulworth Cove instead, if you\u0027re worried about the tricky climb down. Whitby Beach and Sandsend, Yorkshire  A beautifully clean beach that\u0027s easily accessible for families. Walk around 2.5miles up Whitby Beach and it’ll become the slightly quieter Sandsend. There are lifeguards here in the peak season and the sand makes it ideal for little ones to paddle and explore. The promenade features colourful beach huts and gives a handy walkway if the tide is in. There are plenty of places to eat, too.  Whitby is also credited with giving Captain Cook his love of the sea, after he moved to the town to be an apprentice to coal shipping seaman John Walker. Take the Urban Escape Folding Chair (above) - now half price at \u0026pound20 and on offer at two for \u0026pound30 - which is perfect for relaxing in as the waves lap the shore. St Andrews West Sands, Scotland    Stunning views and Scotland\u0027s famous architecture are all on display around St Andrews and its beautiful beach. A ruined castle is nearby, to give you something else to explore if you want a break from games on the beach and the natural beauty of this amazing coastline. St Andrews is, of course, famous for being the home of golf. It also houses one of the UK\u0027s best universities. Famously, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at St Andrews. Your beach walk may well have been one that the young couple enjoyed themselves as students.  Keeping food and drink cool at the beach in summer is a challenge. The Halfords Stripe Cool Bag (above) - now half price at \u0026pound7.50 - will help keep everything fresh until lunch. Mellon Udrigle, Scotland  Worth a visit for the name alone, Mellon Udrigle offers the advantages of the Scottish Highlands and might be a nice break from the summer heatwave. Temperatures in Mellon tend to be a lot lower than most of the UK, so it makes a lot of sense if you\u0027re more about dramatic beauty than sunning yourself.  Gentle dunes and grasses make a for a picturesque beach, but there are also rock pools which kids will adore. They might find crabs, starfish and all manner of other little beasts to inspect – just pop them back where you got them from! Keep your valuables dry with the OverBoard Waterproof Dry Pouch (above), from \u0026pound2.99. It\u0027s super durable and easily buckles onto your belt or bag loops, making it ideal for chilling on the beach.  Botany Bay, Kent  Something of a hidden gem, Botany Bay offers sandy beaches and plenty of exploring fun. The cliffs have smugglers’ caves cut into them, sealed up now, but worth a story or two about the days of covert contraband. Your kids will be fascinated and excited by things to see and do here. Wait for the tide to go out and you can all explore the rock pools, looking for creatures and cooling off their toes in the summer sun. Speaking of sun, you’d do well take some shade with you – particularly for the little ones in your beach party. The Halfords Infant Playshade (below), \u0026pound25, offers 50+ UV protection for children, while the Olpro Beach Hut, \u0026pound70, can keep the whole family covered on scorching days.    This picture-perfect beach is ideal for the kids to run around on. TripAdvisor named it the fourth-best beach in Europe (and the best in the UK), in 2015. The beach was used to train troops in landings during the Second World War, and you can find a memorial to the soldiers at the northern end of the beach. If you\u0027re a surfing family then Woolacombe Beach has great waves, thanks to the Atlantic Ocean – don\u0027t forget to pack your wetsuits! If you’re feeling less brave, pack a Nerf Mega Howler, \u0026pound12.50, for the beach. You’ll be amazed at how far it will fly, thanks to its aerodynamic design. Finger grips make it easy to throw and the noise will delight dogs and toddlers alike. After the beach… Salt water is no friend of the car, so make sure you wash it when you get home. Of course a summer hosepipe ban is likely this year, thanks to record temperatures, so you might want to consider a water-free solution.

The Premier League will come under fire over its attitude towards homosexuality with a bus containing every gay footballer on board - therefore leaving it empty. The protest was organised by Paddy Power, who are partners of Brighton Pride, which is the country’s biggest LGBT+ event, and is being headlined by Britney Spears. The Irish betting firm blamed the environment within football for not supporting players who might want to come out. Last year, FA Chairman Greg Clarke said he was aware of at least two gay Premier League players, and that he was “personally ashamed” that neither feels safe enough to come out.  Spokesman Paddy Power said: “The world’s best-watched league should reflect the community around it – in the UK, one in 50 people consider themselves LGBT+. “And yet, in the Premier League, not one player is openly gay. So we’re calling on the league to boot itself into 2018, and create a welcoming environment for its first gay player. “We think an out gay Premier League footballer would have an extraordinary effect not just on the LGBT+ community, but society in general. They would spearhead profound change and, club colours aside, that’s something we support more than anything else.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains longest married couple parted","story":"NewsBritain\u0027s longest married couple parted after nearly 88 years when husband dies aged 106Maurice and Helen Kaye, who lived together in Bournemouth, married back in 1936Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Burke12:19, 3 AUG 2018Updated12:24, 3 AUG 2018NewsMaurice and Helen Kaye were together for 88 years before Mr Kaye\u0027s death (Image: BNPS)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter an astonishing 88 years together, Britain\u0027s longest married couple have been parted after the husband died suddenly aged 106. Maurice and Helen Kaye married back in 1936, and were set to celebrate their 84th wedding anniversary when Mr Kaye passed away. His 105-year-old wife has since moved to a care home because she couldn\u0027t face living in their flat alone. Despite his advancing years, Mr Kaye\u0027s death took family members by surprise. Just six weeks earlier he and Mrs Kaye had travelled from their home in Bournemouth, Dorset, to attend their grandson\u0027s wedding in London. But he became ill last month, was admitted to hospital and passed away with his family at his bedside. His daughter, Tina Son, said her mother feels like she has lost a limb.  She said: He was 106 and everybody said they thought he was going to go on forever as he was the most amazing man and was quite fit for his age. He and my mother came to London for my son\u0027s wedding just five or six weeks ago. But in the last 10 days of his life he became very poorly, very suddenly. He was taken to hospital and although he did rally a bit, in the last four or five days it was quite clear that he was coming to the end of his life. My mother isn\u0027t too bad, but she feels sad and lonely and feels like she has lost a limb. They had been married for almost 84 years but they had been together for 88 years from when they first started going out. It is a very long time to be with someone and then they are not there anymore.  She has moved to a residential care home because she didn\u0027t want to be sat in the flat by herself thinking about him all of the time. There are people she knows in the home and she can have a bit of a life. They moved to the flat 15 years ago when they were aged 90 and 91. At the time we said to them they were mad moving at their age but they had 15 very happy years living there. Mr Kaye grew up in east London and Mrs Kaye moved to England from Warsaw, Poland, when she was six. The couple met in 1930 when Mr Kaye, as an 18-year-old travelling salesman, used to see his future wife while she worked at her father\u0027s womenswear business in London. They were married on August 27, 1934, in a London Synagogue. When war was declared in 1939, Mr Kaye joined the army but was given compassionate leave when their south London home was bombed just before D-Day in 1944.

Muriel, widowed in 2014, said: “It was all so rapid I just can’t believe it’. “I’d settled for being on my own for the rest of my life and Frank has also been very lonely.” Her fiance added: “I feel very fortunate finding love for a second time.” The retired oil executive, widowed two years ago, met Muriel at All Saints’ Church in Nynehead, Somerset, in November.  Frank told how he first saw the former carer talking to friends there. Three weeks later he sat with her at a Sunday service and Muriel later invited him to meet her sister. The pair then enjoyed a short holiday. Frank said: “Everything changed when we found each other. One problem with old age is loneliness but we bridged over the loneliness by being together. “I hadn’t imagined getting married again and it was the same for Muriel. “But one day we were watching Pride and Prejudice on TV.

The people you love come together for a celebration of your life - complete with cake. What could be better than that? The Duchess of Sussex turns 37 on Saturday, August 4, but her first birthday as a royal probably won\u0027t be a lavish affair and all eyes certainly won\u0027t be on her. This is because Meghan will be spending her birthday at a wedding, where everyone\u0027s focus should be on the happy couple. Harry and Meghan are set to attend the wedding of Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks in the village of Churt, Surrey. Charlie is one of the prince\u0027s best friends and so Harry is set to be taking on the role of best man on the big day - meaning Meghan will have to sit by herself.  William and Kate are also rumoured to be invited to the couple\u0027s big day as William is good friends with the van Straubenzee brothers, with Thomas a godfather to his daughter Princess Charlotte. Last year, Meghan spent her birthday on an African safari with Harry. Her husband, 33, and Charlie, 30, met while attending Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire. They formed a strong friendship, with Charlie and his brother Thomas being ushers at the Duke of Sussex\u0027s wedding in May. His brother was also selected to be Princess Charlotte\u0027s godfather in 2015. Both Charlie and Prince William are said to have roasted Harry in a speech during his wedding reception at Frogmore House. According to The Sunday Times, Charlie made a joke about Harry being a dorm monitor at their school.  He said: All I wanted was a cuddle from my mummy, instead Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out on to the roof. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, how can you put someone in charge of a dorm when that someone is worse behaved than the whole dorm combined? Now it\u0027s the prince\u0027s turn to repay the favour. Until recently the wedding date had remained a secret, but royal photographer Tim Rooke confirmed the date on Twitter.

Jack Johnson, from Wigan, was diagnosed with the incurable Duchenne\u0027s Muscular Dystrophy in 2012 and his parents were told the condition will probably claim his life by 30 years of age. Flying home from Split, Croatia on Tuesday to Leeds after a family holiday, a mix-up with Jack\u0027s wheelchair led Jet2 staff to question whether he was really disabled. The distraught boy was finally allowed to board the plane but only after a shambolic and humiliating experience where they were asked to provide evidence of his disability. Jet2 has since apologised for the incident.  Jack\u0027s mum Alex took to social media to slam the airline for ruining the holiday. She wrote: I can honestly say we have never experienced anything as shambolic and as humiliating for our son as our flight home from Split with Jet 2. The indignity of the situation was awful. Jack was crying and saying \u0027I just want to go home to my grandma’s\u0027. As a family we need and love our holidays because of the underlying heartbreak we live with every day as we watch our son’s muscles waste away. Eventually it will be impossible for us to take Jack on holiday and make the precious memories we cherish with him. Jack is the son of former Wigan Warriors player Andy Johnson. Alex said she told the airline about Jack\u0027s disability and his need for wheelchair assistance when the family booked the flights. She says she followed this up to double check the airline had all the information they needed. Despite this on arriving at Split airport they were told the airline had no record of Jack\u0027s needs, according to Alex, and they usually need two days notice to put a wheelchair on the plane. Alex was then asked for proof Jack suffers from a disability.

The former actress is being considered for an Emmy Award for her portrayal of Rachel Zane in the American television show Suits , making her the first British royal to be submitted for Emmy consideration. The news was confirmed by a network representative on Wednesday. If the submission is successful, Meghan would be nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category for her final season of the legal drama.  None of the Suits cast members have managed to earn a nomination for the show during its first six seasons. However her co-star Patrick J. Adams did scoop a SAG award nomination for his role as her onscreen husband, Mike Ross, back in 2012. Adams has also been submitted for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, along with Gabriel Macht. Rick Hoffman, Sarah Rafferty and Gina Torres are also being considered for Emmy awards in relation to the show.  This would be a last hurrah for Meghan\u0027s acting career, after the Duchess officially retired from the screen at the end of 2017 to focus on her royal duties. I don\u0027t see it as giving anything up. I just see it as a change, said Markle. It\u0027s a new chapter, right? And also, keep in mind, I\u0027ve been working on [Suits] for seven years. We were very, very fortunate to have that sort of longevity on a series...I\u0027ve ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I\u0027ve done there, and now it\u0027s time to work with [Harry] as a team.

She\u0027s always showed thoughtfulness, grace and intelligence - from campaigning against a sexist ad when she was just 11 years old to the humanitarian work she\u0027s been passionate about long before she married Prince Harry. There\u0027s so much talk about the Duchess of Sussex every day, but what has she actually said about herself? As she celebrates her 37th birthday this weekend, here\u0027s what Meghan has said on some of the most important things in her life - in her own words.  On happiness and self-acceptance  On her 33rd birthday Meghan wrote on her website The Tig about the ways she struggled with the idea of fitting in - before she realised it\u0027s important to be kind and accept yourself as you are.   I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.  My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as whatever as everyone else. My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.       You need to know that you’re enough [is a] mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. On her relationship with Harry  In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2016, Meghan spoke about her blossoming relationship with Prince Harry.  She said: We’re a couple... We’re in love. I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story. On the proposal Meghan Markle\u0027s rise to royalty in pictures - from starry-eyed child to Duchess of Sussex  In Meghan and Harry\u0027s first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.  Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, \u0027Can I say yes now?!\u0027 On feminism In her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it: I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’. Two boys from my class said, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong, in the kitchen’. I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt it just wasn\u0027t right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of. It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision — because it isn\u0027t enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn\u0027t enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together.

Photos of Julia Geis-Clements suckling her daughter Cerys minutes after her birth were almost unbearably poignant, a judge said. She had been placed in her mother\u0027s arms for the first time after her birthing pool delivery so they could have skin to skin contact. But disaster struck when Cerys suddenly stopped breathing less than an hour after her July 2012 birth at Queen Charlotte\u0027s and Chelsea Hospital, in London.  Mrs Geis-Clements, 39, and her financier husband Lee, 41, claimed they had been given negligent advice on breast feeding by a midwife. But today, a judge said no one is to blame for the unexplained tragedy. The family\u0027s lawyers claimed the couple should have been warned to keep Cerys\u0027s airway clear as she was pressed against her mother\u0027s breast. The profound oxygen starvation she suffered means she cannot walk or talk and will need 24-hour care for the rest of her life. Senior midwife Clare Nicholls faced claims she negligently failed to warn the couple to keep one of Cerys\u0027s nostrils free during her first feed. She was also accused of giving the couple false reassurance by telling them Cerys would wriggle if she was having trouble breathing.  But, exonerating Ms Nicholls, the judge said midwives cannot say nothing when anxious new parents ask about breast feeding their babies. The advice she gave the couple was logical with a proper basis in fact and there was nothing irresponsible or unreasonable about it. The family\u0027s lawyers also claimed Ms Nicholls should have returned to monitor the exhausted mum 10 minutes into the feed. But the judge said the midwife had correctly positioned Cerys on her mother\u0027s breast and seen her start to feed normally. It was not wrong to leave them alone together for that length of time, ruled the judge. Especially as she was only some 10 metres away, within call and able to respond immediately.  The precise cause or causes of extremely rare events of sudden untoward post-natal collapse in newborns remains unknown, she added. And it had not been proved that the cause of Cerys\u0027s collapse was obstruction of her mouth and nose by her mother\u0027s breast tissue. The judge said: The photographs of the new family shortly afer Cerys\u0027s birth, showing her mother\u0027s joy and delight at her new baby, are almost unbearably poignant given what was to happen just minutes later. It is impossible not to have the very greatest sympathy for Cerys and her parents. But she added: On my findings...no one is to blame for Cerys\u0027s collapse shortly after her birth or for her disabilities. In some cases there is no apparent cause at all of sudden post-natal collapse and what made Cerys stop breathing remains unexplained.

The government is advising families with different surnames to take supporting documentation to airports with them in order to prove they are related. On Wednesday the Home Office shared an image on Twitter urging parents to take birth or adoption certificates on holiday with them in order to speed up the passport control process. They added: Families with different surnames may be asked questions to establish their relationship. The tweet was met with a great deal of indignation from parents on the social platform and Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the UK to Gilead - a fictional patriarchal dystopia in novel The Handmaid\u0027s Tale.   One Twitter user responded: I am fundamentally against this. My husband and I have different surnames. And our son bears my husband\u0027s.  Not unusual for parents to have different surnames in the 21st Century. Appalling stuff by @sajidjavid and the Home Office. Another wrote: Just to clarify women who chose not to take their husband\u0027s surname or have children with a partner they are not married to will be subject to increased border measures. This is what freedom looks like under a Tory government? Straight out of Gilead.  Why might families with different surnames be questioned at airports? Yesterday, the Home Office added a follow-up tweet to explain why the procedure is so important, writing: We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes.  That is why Border Force officers sometimes need to ask additional questions. On the government\u0027s website the situation is explained further: Every day thousands of children arrive at the UK border, many return from holiday with their family or with family friends.  The safety and welfare of every child is of utmost importance to us and sometimes we may ask a few questions if an adult is not the child’s parent, or has a different family name. For more information on Border Force\u0027s policy, there is a leaflet parents can access on the government\u0027s website.   Advice for families travelling with different surnames The government advises that, if you are travelling with children who have a different surname, you may be asked questions at the border to prove your relationship. You can help by bringing with you the following documents:  a birth or adoption certificate showing your relationship with the child divorce or marriage certificates if you’re the parent but have a different surname from the child a letter from the child’s parent or social worker giving permission for the child to travel with you  Last year, a lawyer warned mums and dads they could \u0027unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border control\u0027 if they fail to take the right documents with them, the Manchester Evening News reported.  One of those was Wigan mum Hannah Marshall, who was stopped with her daughter Lilly at London Stansted Airport when they returned from a holiday in Denmark. At the time Hannah, 28, wasn\u0027t married to Lilly\u0027s dad Scott, so while Lilly had the surname Marshall, Hannah\u0027s was still Thomas.  Hannah said While queuing I went to one desk with my daughter and my partner and his mum went to another desk for passport control. They looked at both mine and my daughter\u0027s passports then asked me how I knew the little girl and when I said it was my daughter they asked why I did not have the same last name. They asked my daughter who I was to her and that\u0027s when my partner came over and explained that she\u0027s his daughter too and as we weren\u0027t married she had his last name.  They told us that my partner should have taken her through passport control because I would need to prove she was my daughter. They checked my partner\u0027s passport to prove she held the same last name and then let us through. It can, however, be difficult for a person to prove they are a child\u0027s parent on the spot, unless they are carrying the right documents.  David Connor heads up the family department at Woodcocks Haworth and Nuttall Solicitors, who have offices in Bury and Lancashire and says parents need to plan ahead to avoid being caught out. He said: People need to take extra caution when holidaying with children who don’t share their surname as they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border control. It’s vital you have the correct documentation to hand or it could derail your trip. For separated families, you’ll need evidence of approval from your child’s other parent, but remember to seek approval from everyone with parental responsibility – this may include grandparents too.

Instagram photos show the 38-year-old cuddling with his new lover, London-based Brazilian photographer Gledison Lopez Martins. Intimate snaps on their social media accounts show them together at home in the UK and on their travels around the world. Dewani is almost four years removed from a trial where he was cleared of arranging the murder of his 28-year-old wife in South Africa just days after they got married in 2010.  Dewani and Martins have been in a relationship for about 18 months, and recently went on holiday in Ibiza and attended a fancy dress party with Dewani\u0027s family, MailOnline reports. One photo shows Dewani appearing to be asleep on Martins\u0027 chest a few days before Christmas last year, when they apparently spent the holiday with Dewani\u0027s parents in Bristol. Images reveal the pair have also been on holiday to Mumbai, where Dewani and his wife got married in a traditional Hindu ceremony almost eight years ago. Martins is Facebook friends with a number of Dewani\u0027s relatives, including his parents Shila and Prakash.  Martins was listed as a co-director of a now dissolved company called Dozilda. The Companies House record lists Spain as his nationality. His professional website says he now runs his own business, GLM PhotoStudio, out of an address in Paddington, London. On the first day of his trial, Dewani revealed he was bisexual and had beeing paying a male prostitute called the \u0027German Master\u0027 for sex, something that neither his family nor Anni\u0027s were aware of. Anni\u0027s uncle Ashok Hindocha told MailOnline: If he’s been to Ibiza I hope he enjoyed the beaches.  My family and I will never be able to in the same way because Anni loved the beach and every time we have tried to go we have left in tears. He said the family wants Dewani to explain how he\u0027s been able to move on with his life, but they haven\u0027t heard from him. Mr Hindocha said: We accept he did not murder Anni, but he lied to us and had a very secret gay life. He owes us an apology for his lies. Had the family known the truth about Dewani\u0027s sexuality, he added, they never would have allowed Sweden-born Anni to marry him or travel to South Africa with him.

Diane Geraghty, 76, got her \u0026pound166.42 a week cut off in early May when blundering officials at the government office thought she had died due to an \u0027administrative error\u0027. Mrs Geraghty grew weaker from starvation and lost two stone in weight until a stranger helped her and the pension mix-up was uncovered. Her payments suddenly stopped after her kind and gentle husband of 25-years Joseph Geraghy died from pulmonary complications on April 20. Mrs Geraghty made initial enquiries with her bank to find out what had happened as her food supplies ran low, but had no success.  The proud pensioner kept her plight secret from friends and family including her two sons who live in America and were unaware of her ordeal.  Mrs Geraghty of Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: It\u0027s the way I was bought up to be independent and look after myself. I didn\u0027t want to go banging on people\u0027s doors. It would have felt like begging.  I lived off leftover cheese from my husband\u0027s funeral - I just had a couple of slices each day. I know it seems mad but I wasn\u0027t thinking straight at the time. Describing her husband\u0027s death and the emotional toll on her, she said: It was horrible - it was like watching a man drown without the water. The lack of food soon began to take its toll on the mourning widow as she became increasingly frail. She said: I was confused and upset, I didn\u0027t want to go outside because I was all over the place and people would have thought I was drunk. I was frightened to use the phone because I didn\u0027t have any money to pay the phone bill. I was so weak I thought I was going to die. I had to use my husband\u0027s chairlift because I didn\u0027t have the strength to get up the stairs. I had terrible nerves and lost two stone in weight. I didn\u0027t know which way to turn.  Mrs Geraghty was finally saved in mid-June by an act of kindness from a complete stranger David Kinsella, 67, was walking by her house when he noticed her looking distressed in the front garden. He said: She looked like she was about to burst into tears so I started chatting to her and she told me this awful story. The poor lady was in a right state no money for food or anything at all. She seemed all alone in the world. Mr Kinsella explained she could get emergency food from foodbanks - something Mrs Geraghty was completely unaware of . He also offered to help contact the pension department from his phone to sort the issue. Mr Kinsella then took her to the Lowestoft Foodbank\u0027s Whitton Life Caf where she received her first proper meal in more than a month. Mrs Geraghty said: David was my saviour. The people at the foodbank were so nice - that first slice of bread and butter was heaven. They brought me a cheese and tomato sandwich and a big mug of tea. They gave me two big bags of food and a bag of food for the doggies. They had food in from before so didn\u0027t suffer at all thank god.

It was a very hot day, so she was wearing a pair of ripped denim shorts and an off the shoulder colourful top.

Part of the tusk of a steppe mammoth was found during an an expedition in the Ural Mountains in the Prikamye region of central Russia\u0027s Perm Krai region.  Paleontologists initially thought they had found just a small section of tusk - but when it was fully excavated it measured 3.15 metres (10ft 4ins) long and 22 centimetres (8.7 ins) in diameter. Head of the expedition, Tatyana Vostrikova, said: There were a lot of hypothesis, we thought this was a small fragment, just some kind of plate of tusks. But the excavation revealed its true size. We were all so happy!  The steppe mammoth was one-and-a-half times bigger than a woolly mammoth and roamed over most of northern Eurasia during the Middle Pleistocene period, between 370,000 and 600,000 years ago. It is believed to have evolved in Siberia from the southern mammoth (Mammuthus meridionalis), which was even bigger, and was an ancestor of the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), one of the last of the mammoth line.

I’ll train hard and see how I can improve myself here, that’s the best thing I can do.“The squad is good, everybody is competitive and ready to play.“You have to push each other in training and, hopefully, it’s going to be a good season.”The 24-year-old spent the last three seasons at English non-league side Kidderminster and, after missing out on promotion to the National League, felt it was time to test himself at a higher level.When Dundee came calling shortly after the season finished, there was only one answer from the Frenchman.“I really enjoyed my time at Kidderminster, I had a good few seasons,” he added.“We missed promotion last year but I felt this summer was time for me to move on.“Obviously, Dundee came for me and I thought going to the Scottish Premiership, playing against Celtic and Rangers, would be a good level for me.“I want to step up my level as well and play against better players to improve myself and test myself.“It was the right time for me to move on.“I’ve watched a few games especially the big ones like the Celtic-Rangers ones.“I don’t know everything about the Scottish league but I think it is a good level.”As an attacking midfielder, Ngwatala has impressed many already at Dens Park with his displays in the early-season games.He, though, says there’s more to come from him – and the rest of the team – once the campaign really gets under way over the next few weeks.Shortly after signing, Ngwatala was whisked off to Portugal with the rest of the squad for a pre-season training camp and he says the good work put in on the Algarve will stand the side in good stead this season.He added: “The preparations were hard in Portugal, the weather made it difficult, but we worked very hard so, hopefully, that will help in the season.“We worked on different things and you can see we still need to get to know each other but that will come.“Sometimes it’s good to go away together because the new people like me and the ones already here stay together and learn from each other. It was good.”With a few French speakers already in the squad, it’s been easy for Ngwatala to settle into life at the Dark Blues – and he’s hoping to enjoy some good days with the fans at Dens Park, too.“Everybody is cool, you can speak to everybody, there are no problems.“It helps a lot to have some French speakers but we try to speak English so everybody can understand.“I’ve been surprised at Dens because it was a great atmosphere.“Hopefully, there’s more of that to come.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b62ca6a75773-940x555.jpg ","title":"more than 10000 expected as scottish independence rally in dundee given go ahead","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands are expected in Dundee when a Scottish independence march makes its way through Dundee this month.The March for Independence, organised by All Under One Banner, is expected protesters take to the streets in support of breaking away from the UK.The event is set for August 18, starting at Baxter Park at 12.45pm, after being given the go-ahead by councillors yesterday (Thursday).March organiser Mandeep Singh promised a “family orientated event”.He said: “There are going to be bands playing, various music acts and local speakers.”Mr Singh said it was hoped that between 10,000-20,000 people would turn out.Last month an estimated 14,000 people attended a similar independence march organised by the group in Inverness.Mr Singh added: “We want a much fairer and more prosperous Scotland.“We are fighting for future generations.“I think Scotland is in a unique position. We can be a beacon for people to follow.“We have got some of the best universities and some of the best minds in the world.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united may be cautious but glass is highly rated at the club","story":"\t\t\t\t\tUntil victory at Elgin City on Saturday – however impressive, it was very much a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted – there is no escaping the fact Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign fell way below expectation.A draw and penalty shootout loss against Arbroath followed by defeat at Ross County, though the performance was decent, meant it was effectively over by the mid-point of the group stage.Going into the home clash with Alloa a week past Saturday, mathematically United could have still qualified but, as the most they could have mustered was seven points, we all knew they were out.In the previous two seasons of the group format, no runners-up had progressed with such a low total and that was to be the case again this time round as Inverness missed out on goal difference despite chalking up three wins.That meant, in some ways, another draw, that was followed by more spot-kick woe against the Wasps, was irrelevant.Except for the fact United were looking for decent performances and results in the lead up to this weekend’s Championship opener against in-form Dunfermline.It meant improvement at Borough Briggs, if nothing else to raise morale among fans, was vital.For that reason the 4-0 success up north was a big result for United and manager Csaba Laszlo who, if not quite feeling pressure, had clearly been perturbed by his new-look team’s sticky start.Csaba’s spirits were lifted by the performance and it allowed him to highlight the contribution of a young player whose displays in the Betfred had been largely lost in the gloom surrounding the first three results.In mentioning teenager Declan Glass, though, the gaffer probably demonstrated his awareness of United’s long history of producing exciting young talent. Not only did he avoid going overboard about the 18-year-old, he went out of his way not to compare him with any of those who went before him.Csaba even stressed the kid, who got his first goal at Elgin, will be developed carefully.That’s a process he started last season when there were those who felt Glass should have been thrown into the team.His boss resisted that temptation and, while we can expect to see him feature regularly in matchday squads this term, he will be used carefully.“Declan is a player from our academy and he has skill. At the moment I want to build him up and slowly give him the chance to show how good a football player he is,” said Csaba.“He has to learn a lot, especially he likes to dribble, but he has to play for the team. On Saturday – and in the previous games – he has a really good shot from the second line. He sees the situation and I think he will be a very good football player.”Even with those cautious words, it’s clear how highly United rate this kid. However much they try to protect him, the more is seen of him, the more it’s likely comparisons with other homegrown talent will be made.Given his eye for a goal and the kind of pass in and around the penalty area that creates opportunities for others, the one recent product of the Tannadice youth policy he seems most likely to be compared with is Ryan Gauld.That would come with a degree of pressure and mean he has big shoes to fill but it could be useful in his development. Talent that he is, in four years since leaving for Lisbon, Gauld hasn’t made the progress expected.That can serve as a reminder to Glass, however eager he is to develop, following his manager’s policy of taking things a step at a time looks certain to be the best way forward.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/stipe.jpg ","title":"trialist dismayed as dundee decide to let him go","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA trialist has hit out after apparently failing to earn a deal at Dundee.Croatian striker Stipe Plazibat had been on trial with Neil McCann\u0026#8217s men this week in the hope of earning a deal.He featured in a bounce game against Falkirk yesterday scoring a goal and earning an assist.The Dark Blues won the game 2-0.Expressing his frustration on social media the 28-year-old wrote: \u0026#8220Goal and assist in 2:0 win in test match, and still not enough to earn contract [sic].\u0026#8220Don\u0026#8217t know what else to say. 2018 please finish, this become painful!\u0026#8221\u0026mdash Stipe Plazibat (@StipeSP44) August 1, 2018Responding to critics, he added: \u0026#8220Even manager said that he was pleased with my performance but he is looking for \u0026#8216Target Man\u0026#8217 style of player.\u0026#8221Plazibat is a free agent after being released by Bangkok Glass earlier this year.He did not play a competitive game for the side due to Thai rules meaning they could only sign five foreign players and the Bangkok side decided to terminate his deal.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/04_07_Succession_S01.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"us show succession about a dundee born mogul starring brian cox earns rave reviews","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn American TV show about a Dundee-born media mogul \u0026#8211 played by a Dundonian \u0026#8211 has earned rave reviews.HBO series Succession hit UK screens last night on Sky Atlantic.Hollywood star Brian Cox \u0026#8211 born and raised in the City of Discovery \u0026#8211 plays the part of lead character Logan Roy who is head a powerful global media family owning one of the biggest conglomerates in the world.The Tele previously revealed that Cox only realised his character was Dundonian after he took on the role.The 71-year-old said: “They said to me your American is great but they wanted me to be one of these immigrant children at the beginning of the war who started life in Dundee but ended up in Canada.“It was a surprise because I just wasn’t expecting it.

We keep being told something is going to happen but then nothing ever does.\"A planning application was lodged with the council earlier this year to remove scaffolding and demolish the remaining structure ahead of reconstruction. But hopes that work would start as early as June were dashed when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet about the proposal.Mr Crawford said he and other nearby traders had been kept mainly in the dark throughout the ongoing saga.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it. That can only be achieved by overhauling the current diffuse focus on individual planning applications in isolation.\"Now is the time to make that change.

We have pulled together an enthusiastic team from existing resources available to both organisations.\"I think this will be a positive move for everyone. We can have a lot of valuable experience in both children\u0027s and adult\u0027s services in one setting and become a specialist service that provides a high-quality level of care for young people and their families and carers.\"Ms Chisholm added: \"I think it\u0027s a massive step in the right direction.

while he was studying for his exams.Bosses at the branch have agreed to close the coffee shop in order for the Bucksburn couple to tie the knot on September 8.Jonathan said: “We knew we didn’t want to get married in a church – it’s just not something that really suits us.“Instead, we wanted somewhere with a real meaning to us.“We were looking to do something a bit different.“That’s how we came up with the idea of marrying in Starbucks.“It was my fiancee that first suggested it.“I was initially worried because it’s not the biggest of spaces so I wasn’t sure it would work – but we’re keeping it small and it’s worked out.“Starbucks were really open to the idea and seemed very enthusiastic. They’ve been brilliant – so helpful and really on side.”Jonathan said the branch played a special part in their burgeoning romance.He said: “I met Joanne when she was working there as a barista while she was studying midwifery at Robert Gordon University.“We began going out in April 2016.“I used to come into the Starbucks quite a lot as I was I studying for my professional exams.“To be honest, I was completely oblivious at first – it was my friend that said she liked me.“She would often come across on her break and we got chatting.“That’s really where it all started – the early days of our relationship were in that Starbucks.”Jonathan said friends and family have been slightly bemused by their choice of venue, although they have chosen a more traditional option for their reception – the Marcliffe at Pitfodels Hotel.“The place will be shut between noon and 3pm for the wedding and they’ll be putting up fairy lights and curtains to make it look a bit nicer and like a wedding,” he said.“It’s certainly an unusual choice of wedding venue – I haven’t heard of anything like it before. Disbelief is the most common reaction we get when we tell people where we’re getting married.“The hardest people to win over were our parents who are a bit more traditional.“It took a little bit of persuasion but they’ve come around now.”As the day gets closer, the couple are completing the finishing touches for their dream wedding.Jonathan said: “The nerves are definitely kicking in.“We’re really coming down to the nitty gritty – it’s all becoming very real. But we’re both so excited for the day.”Starbucks regional manager Cindy Ross said: “We are delighted to be hosting the ceremony for Jo and Jona-than.“Jo was a barista here and that’s where she met Jonathan so it was an important place for them.“When she approached us I was over the moon.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b63f3daa48ed-425x564.jpg ","title":"boy rallies neighbours in repair bid","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn enterprising Aberdeen youngster has collected more than 100 signatures on a petition he started in a bid to have his street resurfaced.Zhaohua Deng, known as Dandan, 11, took exception to the state of the road in Burnieboozle Crescent in Craigiebuckler, where he lives.The street has been nicknamed “Bumpyboozle” by residents due to its uneven surface and potholes.Dandan went door to door, accompanied by his mum, collecting 112 signatures.

With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

competition.The winners successfully pitched for a chance to win a free trade stand within the craft tent at the festival, a popular pit stop for those keen to snap up unique designs.With more than five thousand visitors descending on Inveraray Castle for the festival, the six businesses have a fantastic opportunity to raise their profile and sell their products.Now in its fifth year, the Business Gateway Argyll and Bute competition asked business owners to share with the panel of judges why their venture is special and why their products would be a good fit for the festival.The successful businesses who will showcase their products in the Business Gateway sponsored craft tent this year are Keltic Faerie, Janice Bracey Designs, Slate Island Seaweed, Alison McIntosh Prentice, Daisy Rocks Design and Cardross Crab Art.Alison McIntosh Prentice, based in Helensburgh, is an artist who cites the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret as her biggest influence.Using her worldwide travels as inspiration for her art, Alison has a background in graphic and multimedia design but through the years painted as a hobby.Mainly self-taught, Alison now focuses on her art full-time and has exhibited in Barcelona, Wales and Glasgow.Using colours and textures she admired while travelling, Alison’s paintings will be on display and available to buy at a stand within the craft tent at the Best of the West festival.Alison said: \u0026#8216I’ve been attracted to the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret for over 30 years and have further investigated the techniques they used in Gesso artworks which now make up the majority of my work.\u0026#8216The stand at the Best of the West festival will allow me to showcase my art and hopefully sell to those attending.\u0026#8216It’s particularly good timing as I’ve put my travel adventures behind me for now and I’m focusing on being in Scotland and producing the best artwork I can.\u0026#8217The judges included festival host, the Duchess of Argyll, Fergus Murray, Argyll and Bute council’s head of economic development and strategic transportation and councillor Bobby Good,

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

He said: “The AU500 group asked me to help out with sponsorship, but I do a lot for the club with my work Caledonian Vehicle Solutions. “So then I said my band would record a song and donate cash to the club through that. “As a band we haven’t written an original song about Ayr United so hopefully people will like it and it will stick around for years to come.”  Jason, 32, has supported Ayr United for as long as he can remember. Seaside Sons will also play Prestfest this Saturday and will support Kyle Falconer on Sunday at Elliots. The band recruited Ayr supporting musicians to help with the recording.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable.

A Morrisons spokeswoman said: “Due to a higher than normal demand one day this week, our Ayr store ran out of 10p bags.

Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"earlston-high-street-roadworks-to-start-next-month","story":"THERE\u0027S disruption ahead for drivers in Earlston as resurfacing works of the towns High Street get underway next month.\nThe works on the section of the A6105 road will take place from Wednesday, August 1 to Friday, August 10 for eight days, with the route fully open to traffic on Saturday and Sunday, August 4 and 5.\nThe project will be completed in stages, with phase one seeing a section of the eastern end of the High Street closed for three days from August 1-3, from 8.30am to 5pm each day.\nPhase two will be carried out using a convoy system from Monday to Friday, August 6-10, from 8.30am to 5pm each day.\nThe official diversion for drivers will be via the A68, B6362, A697, A6089 and A6105 for eastbound, with the reverse route for westbound traffic.\nParking restrictions will also be in place on the High Street during the works from 8am to 5pm.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

A spokeswoman for the group said they started the petition after growing fed up with speeding vehicles.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe have got trouble with \u0026lsquohot hatch\u0026rsquo cars which come flying along Shore Road.  \u0026ldquoThey go down the front and there are groups of them who turn up with their music going on.

The group\u0026rsquos spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoWe are just fed up with it.  \u0026ldquoThen there are the young people who go down the front and who throw their rubbish out.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove had words with them but it is very intimidating.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom in my early 60s and my husband tends to walk the dogs there now because he is worried about my safety.  The letter sent to the politicians is calling for speed bumps to be introduced on Shore Road and also wants Belhaven included in any plans for a widespread 20mph speed limit in Dunbar.  A suggestion was also made to see a footpath introduced along the length of Back Road to improve safety for pedestrians.  Community warden James Wilson joined Police Constable Gavin Ross in the area last week to try to identify any problems.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThey followed up on complaints of alleged speeding on Shore Road, Duke Street and Back Road and 15 vehicles had their speed checked.  \u0026ldquoSpeed of vehicles (all cars) ranged from 11mph to 22mph.  \u0026ldquoThey also inspected vehicles and spoke to drivers at a nearby car park but there were no issues and no litter. Further spot checks may be carried out.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.

Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.

The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.

And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag.

Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

The\u0026nbsp BBC said it had asked YouTube to also allow the 13 videos to be reinstated to the Wings Over Scotland channel.  BBC Scotland\u0027s head of public policy, Ian Small, said the move came after discussions with \"colleagues in London and elsewhere in the BBC\".    Former First Minister Alex Salmond had criticised the BBC for \u0026ldquorotten conduct amid the crackdown.

That\u0027s that official, then. pic.twitter/rzepQqsKDo  \u0026ldquoThis action is normally limited to asking for individual videos to be removed and the BBC did not ask or demand for these whole channels to be taken down \u0026ndash that was a decision for YouTube alone.  \u0026ldquoWe act irrespective of the political views of the infringing YouTube channels and have taken action against the use of our material by individuals or organisations from across the political spectrum.  \u0026ldquoHowever, we are aware of the significant debate around our approach to removing content, and will be carrying out a review of our practice in relation to \u0026lsquopolitical\u0026rsquo content to ensure it is appropriate for today\u0026rsquos social media environment.  \u0026ldquoWhile we carry out our review, the BBC will not be taking any further action in relation to the Wings Over Scotland videos, which we understand should be re-instated by YouTube.  \u0026ldquoWe note that the rest of the channel has already been restored by YouTube.  \u0026ldquoUntil the review is complete, we will also not be seeking the removal of similar content from accounts unless it is used in a substantially misleading manner or we need to act to protect our commercial or brand interests.  Mr Campbell, insisted the the videos should not have been removed and argued that the BBC had not taken similar action with other political sites that used its material.

Mr Campbell says he was not given the opportunity to similarly \u0027lock down\u0027 his contested clips and save his channel.  But Mr Campbell has highlighted political channels hosted by the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives and UKIP among others which publicly display BBC content.    Mr Campbell has contested the removal of the videos with YouTube citing fair dealing for all of them, \"since all are just short extracts and all of them explicitly identify the original source\".  \"Fair dealing\" exemptions in copyright law, allow material to be used for the purposes of \"criticism, review and reporting current events\" but only allow a \"reasonable and necessary\" amount of someone else\u0027s work to be used.

Bank Governor Mark Carney said the hike, only the second since the financial crash forced rates down to an historic emergency low, warned of further rises ahead.  He said \u0026ldquolimited and \u0026ldquogradual increases were required to bring inflation down to its 2 per cent target now that the UK economic growth appeared to be picking up again.  He said: \u0026ldquoRates can be expected to rise gradually. Policy needs to walk, not run.  The increase means a slight increase in returns for savers, but more costs for those in debt.

The Scottish Fiscal Commission, which determines the spending envelope for the Scottish Government, has forecast Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP growth will stay below 1 per cent for five years.  The MPC baulked at a rate rise earlier this year after the economy dipped as a result of the extreme winter weather caused by the \u0026ldquobeast from the east.  But Mr Carney said growth had since \u0026ldquorebounded, and the Bank raised its UK economic outlook in 2019 from 1.7 to 1.8 per cent growth in GDP.  The raise is likely to be the last before Brexit in March 2019, when Mr Carney has said the increase could be reversed to cope with any economic shock.  Liz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said the raise was \u0026ldquodisappointing given the lack of hard evidence about the economy and Brexit uncertainty.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Bank of England must tread carefully when it comes to further changes in interest rates.  \u0026ldquoPay rises are only just managing to outpace inflation, so this increase is likely to do little to encourage consumer confidence among the millions of Britons with variable rate mortgages.  \u0026ldquoIt is also unlikely it will provide much benefit to savers, or any lasting boost to the pound, with currency markets much more concerned about further clarity in the Brexit negotiations.  The Institute of Directors said the Bank had \u0026ldquojumped the gun by raising the rate now.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe rise threatens to dampen consumer and business confidence at an already fragile time. \"Growth has remained subdued, and the recent partial rebound is the least that could be expected after the lack of progress in the year\u0027s first quarter.\"  Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The decision to raise interest rates looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter-point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.\"  SNP economy spokesperson Kirsty Blackman MP added: \u0026ldquoThe hike in interest rates will deliver a further blow to the living costs and standards of millions of families across the UK, who are already feeling the squeeze as prices rise too fast.  \u0026ldquoThat apprehension is not helped by the continued uncertainty and instability caused by the UK government\u0026rsquos chaotic approach to Brexit, and its reckless rhetoric of a no-deal outcome \u0026ndash which will harm the economy, hit jobs and impact on small and large businesses.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time the UK government acted in the interests of the country, rather than the Tory party, so that households, low earners and businesses are not put under further strain.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the rise was a blow to those struggling with debt.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories\u0026rsquo economic failure is making life difficult for families across the UK. They must change tack and end austerity once and for all.  John Macintosh, head of tax in for Deloitte in scotland, said: \u0026ldquoSub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u0026rsquo time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.  David Alexander, managing director of the leading Scottish estate agents DJ Alexander, said: \u0026ldquoI believe that the increase will not have a detrimental impact on the Scottish property market, whose growth in several areas is out-pacing the rest of the UK. Many of our clients\u0026rsquo properties are continuing to achieve sales levels that are significantly over the asking price.  Tory MP Robert Jenrick, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said: \u0026ldquoOur balanced approach has helped keep mortgage rates low, while also reducing the national debt and helping with the cost of living."},{"url":null,"title":"scot-becomes-youngest-to-cross-the-pacific","story":"  Michael Prendergast, 23, completed the California to Honolulu crossing with three American team-mates in 49 days, 23 hours and 15 minutes.

Now the blue-grey A-listed building is routinely described as the most significant stately home still in private hands. But whose hands exactly?  After years of speculation, an international team of investigative journalists have suggested the early 19th historic monument belongs to an allegedly corrupt ally of former Libyan despot Muammar Gaddafi.    Taymouth Castle  Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba has hit UK headlines before. After the fall - and killing - of Gaddafi the seventy-something former development chief was eventually accused of skimming millions from public contracts.  Libyan authorities, in a 2014 formal request for assistance to the United Kingdom, said their man had invested what they claim is stolen wealth in around 40 properties in Scotland.  Those properties, as reported back in 2016, included the Kenmore Hotel a stone\u0026rsquos throw from Taymouth Castle.    The Kenmore Hotel  The managers of the hotel, sometimes described as Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest inn, however, dismissed that claim as \u0026ldquoludicrous.  Earlier this year the Sunday Times said Mr Dabaiba and his family owned flats in both Edinburgh and Glasgow. All such reports cite a document relating to the Dabaibas\u0026rsquo properties provided by Libyan prosecutors to their Scottish counterparts. Mr Dabaiba and his family are understood to deny any wrongdoing.    Mr Dabaiba and his son Osama  Now the Organized Crime and Corruption Project or OCCRP - in a major investigation of Mr Dabaiba\u0026rsquos offshore finances - have said the document also included Taymouth Castle.  There has been community speculation for some time that the castle, on a loop in the Tay, was linked to Kenmore Hotel.  The Courier last year revealed that the castle and its grounds had been sold to a company called Mount Two Limited based in a free economic zone of the United Arab Emirates.  The paper, which covers Perthshire, said the previous owners Meteor Asset Management had invested some \u0026pound23m in to plans to turn the castle in to a hotel and timeshare destination.  The Courier later linked both Mount Two Limited and a firm called Rebus carrying out the reconstruction work to an English based developer called Clynt Wellington.  The Courier in April said work had \u0026ldquoground to a halt after a tax probe in to Rebus and said investors backing the projects were in talks with the developer.  The Herald was unable to reach Mr Wellington for further clarification. The businessman has been involved with several different enterprises regenerating the castle. One, called Farnham Developments Limited was dissolved earlier this year after going in to liquidation. Another, The Sunday Herald, reported in 2012, had gone in to administration in 2009 leaving unpaid debts.  A firm called Taymouth Estates Limited was liquidated in Guernsey in 2015 owing Farnham Developments \u0026pound1.5m. Its only asset, Farnham liquidators said, was mortgaged land at Taymouth.    Inside Taymouth Castle  Mr Dabaiba - whose whereabouts and exact age are unknown - has had strong links to Scotland and the rest of the UK. A former mayor, he received what is described as a modest wage to run a government department responsible for billions of dollars in development and regeneration contracts. He was previously subject to an Interpol red notice after post-Gaddafi and bitterly divided Libya sought reckoning with the inner circle of the old regime.  The OCCRP late last month published a detailed investigation, based on leaked documents, accusing Mr Dabaiba of skimming 20 per cent from contracts.  It said the former official may have used 16 bank accounts and seven companies in Cyprus as part of a complex international offshore finance mechanism.  Libyans, OCCRP reported, turned to Cyprus and its then confidential banking system after the international sanctions composed after the Lockerbie bombing, the biggest crime in modern Scottish history.  Taymouth Castle was built in the early 1800s and finalised in its current form before Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and hundreds of others in the royal household visited in 1842 on the monarch\u0026rsquos first visit to Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-mcconnell-brexit-folly-crystal-clear-with-stupefying-vacuum-cleaner-chat-as-medicine-stockpiled","story":"  These developments are key elements of this week\u0026rsquos flurry of Brexit-related revelations and warnings. However, it remains difficult to shake the notion that, as the clock ticks towards the March 29 Brexit date and progress on any deal to mitigate the terrifying consequences of leaving the European Union remains elusive, the Tory Eurosceptics are still entirely unperturbed.  This impression was reinforced this week by a tweet from Ross Thomson, Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, as he set out, through a lengthy series of outpourings on Twitter, to hammer home his view of Prime Minister Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan on how to proceed in the Brexit negotiations. He described this plan as \u0026ldquothe status quo but with none of the benefits.  Such a remark, given the conspicuous absence of perceptible benefits from Brexit as well as the huge economic damage already done and the dangers to come, might pique the interest of some who fear the consequences of leaving the EU. What are these benefits of Brexit?  Two tweets later, and some might have viewed Mr Thomson as having entered utterly surreal territory. Unless, of course, everyone thinks the wattage of vacuum cleaners is crucial to the economic prosperity of the UK and the welfare and living standards of its citizens.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Calamitous no-deal risk grows with Tory Brexit circus in full swing  Seemingly getting into his stride in his polemic against the Chequers plan, which has exacerbated the deep divisions in the Conservative Party over Europe, Mr Thomson tweeted: \u0026ldquoNot only will we stay tied to bad regulations such as the EU ban on hoovers with motors more powerful than 900w we will be compelled to follow future EU regulations. Having left the EU\u0026rsquos institutions where these rules are decided the UK will become a voiceless rule taker.  Wow. Does this mean we should forget about the utterly hair-raising nature of the economic situation because a no-deal exit could ensure the pile on carpets is unnaturally high in a post-Brexit Britain?  Whatever the science of vacuuming, Mr Thomson is obviously entitled to his opinion.  However, surely his concerns about vacuum cleaners pale into insignificance relative to the fact that a multinational drugs company is arranging to stockpile medicines because of uncertainty over the nature of the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the EU. Swiss pharmaceuticals company Novartis indicated it was also planning for a no-deal Brexit.  It is more than two years since the Brexit vote in June 2016. And there is now less than eight months to the date set for Brexit.  Given the UK\u0026rsquos lack of progress in its negotiations with the EU, the instability of the Westminster Government, and the monumental and deepening rift within the Conservative Party over Brexit, stockpiling is a sensible thing for companies such as Sanofi and Novartis to do.  Last month, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East raised the possibility of the engineering group having to stockpile parts if the UK got ever closer to the Brexit date without clarity on what was going to happen.  Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said this week: \u0026ldquoNo deal...is just not an option. It would be seriously damaging to the industry not just in the UK but in Europe as well.  This week, we have also had a dire warning about the impact of Brexit on small firms. The Federation of Small Businesses, sounding the warning, declared that a transition period was \u0026ldquovital so firms could \u0026ldquooperate broadly as they do now until December 31, 2020. Its research found 59 per cent of UK small businesses which export goods to countries in the European customs union feel trade will be impacted if overall costs increase as a result of having to complete additional customs declarations. And 11% of smaller firms say they would stop exporting to the EU. These findings should make the UK Government sit up and take note, but no doubt they will not.  FSB national policy chairman Martin McTague warned: \u0026ldquoSmaller businesses, and those businesses they rely upon, simply don\u0026rsquot have enough time to prepare for a cliff-edge Brexit.  And a survey published this week by Royal Bank of Scotland shows investment by Scottish businesses continues to decline amid Brexit uncertainty, with no sign this situation is about to improve.  Capital expenditure by Scottish companies has now fallen for six consecutive quarters, according to the survey, conducted in association with Strathclyde University\u0026rsquos Fraser of Allander Institute.  After an initial tumble in Scottish business investment in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote, there was then a brief rebound as company chiefs perhaps realised that less would change immediately than they might have expected.  But six quarters of falling investment shows that any such relief has long gone. What we are seeing now from companies looks more like a growing sense of dread.  The Conservatives have shown they are pretty adept at economic malaise since they came to power in 2010. Their austerity programme choked off growth, and Brexit has made things a whole lot worse.  The UK\u0026rsquos grim economic performance has hammered living standards. And these will be hit far harder still if the Brexit folly is pursued.  Given the gravity of the situation, which is illustrated well by the stockpiling of medicines, it is lamentable that autonomy to determine the wattage of vacuum cleaners is advanced as a benefit of Brexit. And the fact the Brexiters are clutching at such straws highlights just how utterly absurd it is to be leaving the EU at all."},{"url":null,"title":"women-lose-meat-appetite-in-face-of-young-animals","story":"  They are more responsive to lambs, piglets, calves or joeys than men and the phenomenon is due to their traditional role as care-givers.

Psychologist Dr Jared Piazza at Lancaster University said: \u0026ldquoWe found both men and women find baby, farmed, animals to be cute and vulnerable, and experience feelings of tenderness and warmth towards them.

He said this could be because women are often caregivers, even in today\u0026rsquos society.  Dr Piazza said: \u0026ldquoOur findings may reflect women\u0026rsquos greater emotional attunement towards babies and,  by extension, their tendency to empathise more with baby animals.  \u0026ldquoAlso, meat is associated with masculinity and images of tough men who consume meat for muscle building protein, along with prehistoric ideas of the male as hunter.  \u0026ldquoWomen have a much more ambivalent attitude towards meat and their identity is not bound up with it in the same way."},{"url":null,"title":"michel-barnier-torpedoes-theresa-may-ahead-of-brexit-talks-with-macron","story":"  Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos intervention undermined the Prime Minister on the eve of today\u0026rsquos meeting with President Macron at Fort de Br\u0026eacutegan\u0026ccedilon, his state residence on the C\u0026ocircte d\u0026rsquoAzur.  In an article published in 20 newspapers across Europe, Mr Barnier said some of the UK\u0026rsquos proposals would undermine the single market and threaten the EU.  Mrs May is cutting short a holiday in Italy to visit the French president as part of wider cabinet effort to woo individual nations on the merits of the Chequers plan.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was in Austria earlier this week, warning a failure to agree a Brexit deal based on the plan would be a \u0026ldquohuge geo-strategic mistake.  Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was also in France yesterday promoting the scheme.  The UK proposal would see a \u0026ldquocommon rule book between the UK and the EU on goods and and agri-food, but greater freedom on services and migration.  Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos article reinforced the EU view that this was unacceptable \u0026ldquocherry picking.  Although his argument was familiar, his timing was seen as a pointed snub to the PM.  It also jarred with reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was ready to back a so-called \u0026ldquoblind Brexit, a vague fudge which would help Mrs May avoid a no-deal Brexit.  However, in better news for Mrs May, Mr Barnier also said the EU would be more flexible on the key issue of a backstop for trade and customs in Northern Ireland.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoLet\u0027s be frank: as the UK has decided to leave the Single Market, it can no longer be as close economically to the rest of the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe UK wants to leave our common regulatory area, where people, goods, services and capital move freely across national borders.  \u0026ldquoThese are the economic foundations on which the EU was built. And the European Council - the 27 Heads of State or government - as well as the European Parliament have often recalled that these economic foundations cannot be weakened.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThe UK knows well the benefits of the Single Market. It has contributed to shaping our rules over the last 45 years.  \u0026ldquoAnd yet, some UK proposals would undermine our Single Market which is one of the EU\u0027s biggest achievements.  \u0026ldquoThe UK wants to keep free movement of goods between us, but not of people and services. And it proposes to apply EU customs rules without being part of the EU\u0027s legal order.  \u0026ldquoThus, the UK wants to take back sovereignty and control of its own laws, which we respect, but it cannot ask the EU to lose control of its borders and laws.  He said the biggest risk caused by Brexit was in Ireland, with the need to avoid a hard border between north and south.  \u0026ldquoWhat the EU has proposed is that Northern Ireland remains in a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU. We are ready to improve the text of our proposal with the UK, he said.  It was reported that Environment Secretary Michael Gove privately discussed the UK being \u0026ldquoparked in the European Economic Area alongside Norway after Brexit to avoid a no-deal.  The Financial Times reported the Brexiter floated the option at a dinner of moderate Tory MPs and peers on June 25, before the Chequers plan was decided.  German reports said Mrs Merkel was considering a blind Brexit involving hazy declarations on intent rather than a formal treaty to help the Prime Minister.  Labour MP Chris Leslie of the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the Brexit deal, said the EU should not offer Mrs May a face-saving way-out.  He said: \u0026ldquoA blind Brexit would take the UK to the same place as a no-deal Brexit, but without the clarity. The idea that the fundamental contradictions of the government\u0026rsquos Brexit policy can be more easily resolved after the UK has left the EU is simply ludicrous.  \u0026ldquoA blind Brexit is being talked about because some see it as a short-term face-saving deal for both the British government and the European Union, both of which are now terrified that concluding with a failure to agree a deal will result in a humiliating no-deal Brexit.  \u0026ldquoWith the EU27 governments and the EU commission wanting to spare Theresa May\u0026rsquos blushes, there is a risk we end up with a fake deal to save face."},{"url":null,"title":"former-mp-jim-murphy-earns-150k-as-political-consultant","story":"  The former Scottish Secretary paid himself \u0026pound56,500 in 2016 and \u0026pound89,700 in 2017 through his firm Arden Strategies Limited.

Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager costs were \u0026pound3,488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2,400 in 2017, however his official candidate return did not mention the SUAT partly bankrolled the posts.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001 but does not publish accounts, is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission over its status as a donor.  It was only last month, after the SNP challenged Theresa May over the SUAT at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, that the shadowy outfit first named its trustees.  The SNP last demanded full transparency from the Scottish Secretary on the issue.  The money trail from the SUAT to Mr Mundell emerged yesterday when the Electoral Commission published the accounts of hundreds of small party branches across the UK.  These included the Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association (SBCUA), which covers the Tweeddale part of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale seat.  The accounts for 2017 said the SBCUA had a paid campaign manager overseeing a series of elections, including Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos general election fight.  \u0026ldquoThe Association is very grateful to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust for providing 50% of the funds for this crucial campaigning position throughout 2017, with the Association itself being responsible for the balance, it said.  However there is no public record of the SUAT donating directly to the SBCUA in 2017.  Other SBCUA accounts showed the SUAT also part-funded a campaign manager for Mr Mundell in 2014 and 2015 in the long build-up to the 2015 election.  The cost split was not given, but official election invoices listed the campaign manager costs as \u0026ldquo103 days @ 50% and \u0026ldquo38 days @ 50%.  The SUAT gave the SBCUA at least \u0026pound12,336 in 2014 and \u0026pound6,168 in 2015.  The SUAT and SBCUA also jointly funded a campaign manager for Tory MP John Lamont in Berwickshire, Roxburgh \u0026amp Selkirk in 2015 and 2017.  During the 2015 election, the chair and treasurer of the SBCUA was former Merrill Lynch consultant Robert Miller-Bakewell, the chair of the SUAT.  He was also deputy chair and deputy treasurer of the SBCUA at the 2017 election.  Mr Mundell has denied getting cash from the SUAT, but has not denied campaign help.  However he was cagey about the issue when quizzed on BBC Radio Scotland last month.  He said: \u0026ldquoI personally have not received cash because we go through a process of funding associations and I am confident that over the full period during which I have been involved in politics, all donations I have received from any source have been appropriately declared.  Asked him much money his campaign had received, he said: \u0026ldquoThat is a question that can be sourced from all the declarations.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory dark money scandal is a running embarrassment for the party, and they\u0027re doing themselves no favours in trying to hide from scrutiny.  \"David Mundell has repeatedly tried to deny his links to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust. Now it seems they helped bankroll his election campaign.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re talking about one of the most senior Tories in Scotland here. He should be open and honest over where this money came from.  \u0026ldquoTransparency over party finances is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy. The public have the right to know who helped put their politicians into office.\"  The Electoral Commission yesterday said it would not be investigating a \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo row involving the DUP, a former Scottish Tory, and the EU referendum.  A BBC Northern Ireland TV programme alleged the DUP may have worked improperly alongside other pro-Brexit campaigners.  The DUP accepted \u0026pound435,000 from the Constitutional Research Council, chaired by former Scots Tory candidate Richard Cook, on the eve of the referendum, which was then spent on newspaper ads in the UK.  The Commission said it did not have grounds to open an investigation into the allegations.  However it also urged the UK government to bring forward legislation allowing it to disclose details of past donations to Northern Ireland parties, which are currently kept secret.  Mr Mundell is currently on a UK Government trip to New Zealand.  The Scottish Conservatives said all SUAT donations to the party and all election spending had been properly and fully reported to the Electoral Commission in line with the law.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe money donated from the SUAT comes from the proceeds of the sale of Scottish Conservative properties in Scotland in the 1960s.  \u0026ldquoSince then, the SUAT has used those funds to promote the interests of the party.  \"These publicly registered documents show that the SUAT has helped fund a campaign manager for the SBCUA in recent years, as it has supported other Associations across Scotland.

Council leader Susan Aitken told BBC Scotland\u0027s Good Morning Scotland radio programme the council is prohibited from providing accommodation for people who have exhausted the asylum process but uses its general power of welfare to help particularly vulnerable groups such as families and those with HIV.

Ms Aitken said: \"We need to look at it very carefully and we are looking at it very carefully if we can use our general power of wellbeing to supersede UK law and support a wider range of people who find themselves essentially being made destitute as a consequence of UK Government policy.\"  She said the council could face legal challenges from the Home Office over its actions.  Ms Aitken added: \"Glasgow City Council will step up and we will support vulnerable people where we possibly can but what we really need is not for us to step in and pick up the mess left behind by UK Government policy. We need a change in UK Government policy.\"  Serco revealed plans at the weekend to begin changing the locks on accommodation for asylum seekers refused refugee status.  The group said it has provided acommodation for months in some cases for those without the right to remain in the UK, without recompense from the Home Office and at a cost of more than \u0026pound1 million a year, which it claimed should be borne by the council.  Ms Aitken said these costs should be borne by the Home Office and repeated calls to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to step in and stop the evictions.  Serco chief executive Rupert Soames has said lock-change notices would be given to no more than 10 people a week for the next four weeks.  He said none of these would be families with children and all will be people who the Home Office considers to have exhausted their appeal process and no longer have the right to remain."},{"url":null,"title":"gay-pride-takes-aim-at-ba-for-link-to-deportations","story":"  Activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants called on the airline to \"stop being complicit\" in working with the Government to deport people, as the festivities at Brighton Pride began on Friday.  The open letter, published in  and signed by scores of MPs and public figures, claims the presence of companies at the event which \"profit off deportations is an affront to the vision of freedom Pride represents\".  It said: \"It is an added insult that many of those deported on British Airways are LGBTQIA+ people who should be marching with us at the parade but are instead brutally rounded up and ejected from the UK to face poverty, persecution and, in some cases, death.\"  Signatories include shadow home secretary Dianne Abbott as well as MPs David Lammy and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who represents Brighton Kemptown, the Green Party\u0027s equalities spokeswoman Aimee Challenor and campaigners including actor Andrew Garfield.  More than 50,000 people have signed an online petition calling on BA to stop helping the Home Office deport people.  BA said it is bound by law to do so when asked by the Government but the airline is never told someone\u0027s personal information, including their sexuality.  Campaign spokesman Sam Bjorn said: \"We won\u0027t stand by and let British Airways use their Pride sponsorship to polish their image while they are complicit in the Home Office\u0027s cruel deportations.\"  The calls reiterated those made to the airline in June after Virgin Atlantic announced \"in the best interests of its customers and people\" it would no longer offer seats to the Home Office to forcibly deport people from the UK deemed to be illegal immigrants.  The announcement came after a backlash over the Windrush scandal which saw at least 63 people wrongly deported, amid pressure from campaigners in the run-up to London Pride, which Virgin sponsored.  A BA spokeswoman said: \"It is a legal requirement (under the Immigration Act 1971) for all airlines to deport people when asked to do so by the Home Office.  \"Not fulfilling this obligation amounts to breaking the law. Airlines only have the right to refuse deportees on the basis that they feel there is a threat to the safety or security of the aircraft/its passengers or the individual.  \"We are not given any personal information about the individual being deported, including their sexuality, or why they are being deported. The process we follow is a full risk assessment, with the Home Office, which considers the safety of the individual, our customers and crew on the flight.\"  She said the company was proud to support this weekend\u0027s Pride event, with staff taking part, and the airline had a \"long and proud history\" of supporting the LGBT+ community.  A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"The UK is a world leader in its approach to handling asylum claims on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and has worked with leading charities on our dedicated caseworker guidance.  \"No one who is found to be at risk of persecution on the grounds of sexual orientation and/or gender identity will be returned to their country of origin.  \"However, where someone is found not to need international protection and has no other basis to remain in the UK, we do expect them to leave. We work in collaboration with airlines to ensure any facilitated voluntary or enforced removals are carried out effectively, efficiently and with the welfare of returnees and other passengers at the heart of the process.\""},{"url":null,"title":"review-citizens-of-everywhere-george-square-glasgow-four-stars","story":"  Citizens of Everywhere!  George Square, Glasgow  Keith Bruce  THE FEW who braved the inclemency \u0026ndash and yes, it rained, but it was neither cold nor torrential \u0026ndash witnessed a very special collaboration in George Square, and one that certainly deserved a larger audience. What was striking was how it played to the strengths of everyone involved to make something unique and specific to the city.  Artist Douglas Gordon, he of the 24 hour Psycho and Zidane, had sourced a film of singer and human rights activist Paul Robeson leading the May Day parade from the city centre to Queen\u0026rsquos Park in 1960, which was screened with live commentary in the form of a specially-commissioned narrative poem from Scotland\u0026rsquos Makar Jackie Kay. Emotive as the images were, her words were brilliantly synchronised to them, recording the banner of the Springburn Socialist Sunday School, placards demanding Playing Fields not Battlefields, and the guest of honour tipping his hat to well-wishers on the way, as well as building in a wealth of other amusing cross-cultural references like \u0026ldquoSunday in the Park with Paul.  From there singer Suzanne Bonnar improvised an a capella version of Robeson\u0026rsquos Showboat hit Ol\u0026rsquo Man River, which she would reprise later with orchestral accompaniment, as a bridge to the RSNO playing Alex MacKay\u0026rsquos arrangement of a work Gordon commissioned from rock band Mogwai for an arts installation in Germany, entitled Music for a Forgotten Future: The Singing Mountain.  The geographical tour of Europe continued with the orchestra under conductor Jean-Claude Picard and composers Mendelssohn, Beethoven, MacCunn, Grieg, and Smetana in what was a beautifully constructed programme to launch Glasgow\u0026rsquos hosting \u0026ndash in partnership with Berlin, where Gordon now lives \u0026ndash of the European Championships. For the earlier part of the performance pursuit cycling from the velodrome a few miles to the East played on another screen in the square as a reminder of that link.  One could imagine a day when \u0026ndash regardless of the weather \u0026ndash this concert and its preceding live art work would have been a sensational opening event for Glasgow\u0026rsquos Mayfest festival. As it was, and although the rain will undoubtedly be made the scapegoat by those who commissioned it, this was a criminally undersold event with an attendance that ill-served the talented people who made it."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-airport-flight-path-changes-resubmitted-to-regulator","story":"  The Civil Aviation Authority put the airport\u0027s initial submission on pause last September and asked bosses to review part of the design.  A fresh proposal has now been put forward, which will see aircraft fly towards the west of Cramond and along the Firth of Forth.  The airport undertook a supplementary consultation on the changes to its initial proposal between May and June.  It included two public sessions, a Facebook Q\u0026ampA session, a social media campaign and information being sent to more than 12,000 homes, elected members and groups.  From the 1,167 responses from residents, 1,035 or 87% were broadly opposed to the proposals.  Those living in Dalgety Bay in Fife were most vocal in their response, with 729 respondents of which 688 were opposed.  Previous consultations on changes to flight paths have seen residents raise concerns over issues such as noise and the environmental impact.  However the airport, the busiest in Scotland, says modernising its airspace, designed in the 1970s, is necessary in order to handle \"strong levels of growth\" in operations since 2013.  It says a change in flight paths will allow more flexibility with flights and maintain service levels, while building increased capacity for future growth.  Chief executive Gordon Dewar said: \"Vast growth at the airport as well as the change in technology means we need to modernise our airspace to meet current and future demand, and it is a process many airports are looking at.  \"Our approach at Edinburgh Airport must be one that is balanced between the needs of the airport and the economy and customers we serve as well as those of our neighbouring communities - we believe our proposals do that.  \"Although there was no requirement to consult, we wanted to go back to our communities to listen to their valued feedback and understand their concerns.  \"They were part of a wider conversation with our airlines and other partners who all have an interest in this process and our proposals take into account all of that dialogue.  \"The process has always been about participatory democracy rather than electoral and we have gained a greater insight into our approach due to this.  \"As with previous consultations, we have published a report detailing what we\u0027ve heard and that will be followed by a rationale document later this month which will explain the thinking behind our resubmitted proposal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a96 upgrade report due","story":"        A report on the economic impact of upgrades to the A96 is expected to be published later this summer.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974.

It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Friday 3 Aug 2018 7:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also governed by a Viscount, a title which — in real life — was traditionally held by the heir to the Earl of Orkney.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Friday 3 Aug 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Public services group Serco, which provides accommodation for asylum seekers on behalf of the Home Office, plans to evict up to 330 asylum seekers in Glasgow who have failed to gain refugee status.            Council leader Susan Aitken told BBC Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland radio programme the council is prohibited from providing accommodation for people who have exhausted the asylum process but uses its general power of welfare to help particularly vulnerable groups such as families and those with HIV.            She said she has instructed council lawyers to examine whether this can be extended to cover those who face having their locks changed by Serco, many of whom are young, single men.Ms Aitken said: “We need to look at it very carefully and we are looking at it very carefully if we can use our general power of wellbeing to supersede UK law and support a wider range of people who find themselves essentially being made destitute as a consequence of UK Government policy.”She said the council could face legal challenges from the Home Office over its actions.Read more: Refugees begin ‘hunger strike’ in response to Serco eviction notices in GlasgowMs Aitken added: “Glasgow City Council will step up and we will support vulnerable people where we possibly can but what we really need is not for us to step in and pick up the mess left behind by UK Government policy. We need a change in UK Government policy.”            Serco revealed plans at the weekend to begin changing the locks on accommodation for asylum seekers refused refugee status.The group said it has provided accommodation for months in some cases for those without the right to remain in the UK, without recompense from the Home Office and at a cost of more than £1 million a year, which it claimed should be borne by the council.Ms Aitken said these costs should be borne by the Home Office and repeated calls to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to step in and stop the evictions.Serco chief executive Rupert Soames has said lock-change notices would be given to no more than 10 people a week for the next four weeks.            He said none of these would be families with children and all will be people who the Home Office considers to have exhausted their appeal process and no longer have the right to remain.Read more: Ibrox brawl: Two in hospital as fans fight ahead of Rangers’ Europa League game"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777263.1533199292!/image/image.jpg","title":"motor dealer eastern revs up with barnetts takeover","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s motor retail industry has seen further consolidation after Eastern Western Motor Group struck a deal to acquire rival Barnetts.                Eastern Western – one of the country’s biggest players – has purchased the entire share capital of Barnetts Motor Group, which represents Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo from a large single site in Dundee and also Volkswagen in St Andrews.            No financial details have been disclosed for what is likely to have been a fairly substantial multi-million-pound deal.            The Barnetts business generated sales of £65.3 million last year and returned a £1.3m pre-tax profit.The Volvo franchise will be transferred to the John Clark Motor Group, as revealed earlier this week, and in turn Eastern Western Motor Group acquires the Nissan businesses in Dundee and Perth. Nissan in Dundee will be rehoused in the showroom vacated by Volvo.Douglas Brown, group managing director of Eastern Holdings, Eastern Western Motor Group’s parent company, said: “We have known Paul Barnett for many years and as a result it has been a quick, professional and seamless transaction.“Barnetts Motor Group and the Nissan franchises in Dundee and Perth will be a great addition to the Eastern Western Motor Group. It will give further depth and scale to our existing business and increase our points of representation of these franchises to five Nissan, four Volkswagen and two Mazda.“Similar to our recent acquisitions of Grassicks BMW and Mini in Perth and Phoenix Honda in Stirling, this further cements our relationship with three of our key partners and is in line with our strategy of growing and developing the group with existing brand partners in new geographical territories.            “We look forward to welcoming Barnetts’ teams and our new Nissan teams to the group and we will continue to trade under the Barnetts name in Dundee and St Andrews as it is synonymous with quality and excellent customer service. Nissan in Perth will trade as Western Nissan.”Barnetts Motor Group was formed when its first Volvo dealership was opened in Seagate in the early 1960s. The company has grown steadily and now employs 150 people throughout Tayside and Fife selling more than 4,000 vehicles every year and carrying out in excess of 25,000 services annually.It is understood that Paul Barnett will turn his focus to further developing the family’s property interests through Barnetts Properties.Eastern Western represents 12 franchises – Mercedes-Benz cars, Smart, Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles, BMW, Mini, Lexus, Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Harley-Davidson."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777455.1533210110!/image/image.jpg","title":"alastair dalton clear pavement congestion with no stopping zones","story":"        There\u0026#8217s a pecking order on the roads, however much you hate to admit it.                The relationship between drivers, cyclists and pedestrians reminds me of the classic 1966 TV sketch on the class system, featuring John Cleese, Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett.            Upper class Cleese looks down - both physically and metaphorically - on middle class Barker, who in turn looks up to Cleese but down on lower class Corbett, who “knows his place”.            On the roads, many drivers still think it’s their highway, with cyclists and pedestrians an irritating hindrance who should keep out of the way.Likewise, some cyclists can be as guilty as those drivers, seeking to clear pedestrians from their path, even riding in their space on pavements.Meanwhile, pedestrians, apart from the jaywalkers, are often to be seen scurrying away from both cars and bikes, while many simply put up with cyclists on pavements without complaint.But just as drivers and cyclists jockey for space on the roads, there’s also a battle for room among pedestrians on pavements, none more so than in Edinburgh, now the Festival is upon us.The narrow streets of the Old Town were chock-a-block with tourists last week, who have since been joined by a growing influx of Festival-goers and performers.            If it’s hard for them to move around, what are the chances for those trying to work in the city in such conditions?Common obstacles include the large group of slow moving tourists, who are even more tricky to negotiate if they are coming towards you.Then there are the sauntering types with their random progress, which can be difficult to predict so you can overtake them safely.But most hazardous of all are those who come complete with large protrusions like giant backpacks or long-lense cameras sticking out at various angles. Even worse if they were to stop abruptly, or suddenly swing round.            In the past, there have been calls for Greenways-style lanes for faster walkers, a bit like those in swimming pools to separate different speeds of swimmer.However, there wouldn’t be room for them in many of the most congested spots, such as the busiest parts of the Royal Mile.Even painted a special colour, such lanes could become invisible under many feet, and even if noticed, would be likely to confuse or be ignored.Far better to introduce “no stopping zones” where the bottlenecks are worst.Well-positioned signs with sufficiently scary wording should do the trick - because those who spot them will jolly along the rest.            Seeing passengers running for a train is highly infectious and it is quite difficult to stop yourself following suit. It should be the same with no-stopping zones - if everyone else is moving, it’s easier to go with the flow and hard to stop.Of course, there’ll be a need to be stop-off zones too, like laybys on roads, such as where there’s a photograph to be snapped. If that doesn’t work, those in a hurry may just have to take circuitous routes via quieter streets, perhaps with some priority “fast green man (and woman)” lights at crossings?If all else fails, help may be at hand when the Edinburgh cycle hire scheme launches next month - and even more so when they are bolstered by electric bikes next year. Just mind you don’t try riding on the pavement."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777920.1533233129!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie hey teachers leave those cool kids alone","story":"        Teachers should be relaxed about some pupils being \u0026#8216cool\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a quality like being good-looking or charming, if not actually one of the big virtues, such as honesty, loyalty and kindness, writes former headteacher Cameron Wyllie.                Five years ago, I was on an October Week trip to New York City organised by the art-and-design department of the school where I was a senior manager.            The party consisted of me, two lovely pals of mine who taught art and design, and 25 students from the senior years.             We did a little bit of NYC tourist stuff and toured the politan Museum, The Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney. We saw a show. And, of course, we shopped. The hours for shopping were strictly regulated but we all got our fix and, let’s be honest, the typical pupil of art and design does like a nice outfit.Thus I found myself in the flagship store of Uniqlo on Fifth Avenue, while the young people threw themselves at arty T-shirts, puffer jackets and unusually patterned footwear.I, being approximately 18 times their age, contented myself browsing among the astonishingly cheap cardigans. Then I tried on a hat – a simple old-fashioned trilby in grey and burgundy. While I was considering the crumbling view in the mirror, one of the kids wandered past and said, “Good hat. You should buy that.” Now this was one of the seven boys on the trip, a young man of definite style who, like many of them, dressed with the easy detachment of fashionable youth.            So I did buy that hat (in the sale, $12) and every time I wear it, someone will say “I like your hat” or “great hat” or “Where did you get that hat?” or “You suit that hat”. It doesn’t matter what artfully contrived combination of other clothes I have on, the blooming hat gets the praise, the one thing that I didn’t really pick myself. I don’t know whether to be grateful or irritated.READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upThe truth is, some people are cool and most of us are not. A common complaint about young people in schools is that they spend way too much time trying to be cool – in the staffroom, wise old heads nod together and say of some errant child, “Aye that one’s too cool for school.”             It isn’t completely clear to anyone what ‘cool’ really means but essentially we all understand it – at a school leavers’ function some years back I used the word ‘cool’ in praise of one of the other young people there, which led to a discussion about who, exactly, was ‘cool’ in this group of people they had been with for years and years. They unanimously identified five or six people who combined some of the necessary characteristics and I could only concur with their selection. There were no hard feelings – only a few are chosen and the rest of us just have to get on with it.What teachers need to accept is that there’s nothing wrong with being cool – it’s just something that happens, like being very funny or having good hair. We need to stop railing about ‘coolness’ like we rail about smoking or idleness (it may be that some cool kids smoke and some are lazy but it’s not a necessary part of the conidition).             One school I know of went through such an ‘anti-cool campaign’ that it enlisted children to wear ‘Glad To Be Sad’ badges, which I personally felt to be going a bit far (though I imagine the badges themselves are now collectors’ items).This kind of approach towards a particular kind of teenager only encourages all teenagers to exaggerate the gulf in attitudes between themselves and their teachers heaven forfend, it may make them think that some of their teachers are a teeny bit jealous because they themselves were never cool, and never will be. READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertIncidentally, make no mistake – when a 16-year-old says “I think Mr Smith is cool”, it probably just means that Mr Smith does not impose the regulations regarding late homework, not that the young person would let Mr Smith choose their hair products.So let’s try to view ‘cool’ differently. Let’s see it as a desirable personal characteristic that some people have and let’s look at it positively. In educating young Scots about the state of the world they’re going into, let’s talk with them about all the different characteristics humanity shares, and instead of sneering at this vague but desirable state, let’s praise them all for what they give the world.  Of course, there’s a big range of personal virtues to choose from and ‘cool’, given its temporary nature, goes in the column with ‘good looks’ and ‘charm’, rather than being a big hitter like ‘honesty’, ‘loyalty’ or, biggest of all, ‘kindness’. Instead of being so negative and taking the risk of alienating pupils who, let’s face it, are usually popular with their peers, let’s accentuate the positive and gently point out what really matters in the long term whether you’re cool or not.  The American singer Courtney Marie Andrews puts it well: “And if your money runs out/And your good looks fade/May your kindness remain.” Heidies – there’s a good message for the first assembly of term!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777922.1533233141!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy nationalism is wrong but i might back scottish patriot party","story":"        Nationalism could result in different parts of Scotland adopting a \u0026#8216clan-like\u0026#8217 mentality. writes Jim Duffy.                Do you remember Mandy? No, not the Barry Manilow song, the New Labour politician. Yes, Lord Mandelson, as he is now known. He was in and out of Tony Blair’s Cabinet more often than it rains in Glasgow. A key architect of the New Labour movement, which in itself these days sounds totally ridiculous based on where the current Labour Party is, Mandy was always one to have his say no matter who it upset.             So, this political relic has popped his head above the parapet again this week. And I’ve been educated. He has given us a clear definition of the difference between a nationalist and a patriot. This, in turn, made me think of how polarised and dysfunctional an independent Scotland would be actually become ...            Patriotism apparently is love of one’s own country. I guess that’s why the Americans always call themselves patriots. They salute the flag and it hangs proudly everywhere. They then created the Patriot Act after 9/11. An Act designed to protect their beloved country. And of course the Americans created a missile defence system called the Patriot Defence System that they sell all over over the world to their “friends”.I’m digressing into vituperative mocking of America here .... apologies, back to Mandelson. So, patriotism is all about loving your country, wanting the best for it, caring about it, its societies and well-being. It all sounds very altruistic, noble and meaningful.In fact, I could call myself a patriot of Scotland. I’m proud of being Scottish and proud of being part of the United Kingdom as well. So, I’m doubly patriotic. But, I feel nothing for the EU. So, no treble here. I bet 99 per cent of you reading this are patriotic about your country. We should be as it’s harmless and built upon genuine, unbiased thinking.So what about nationalism? Well, according to Lord Mandelson, “nationalism, on the other hand, is a hatred of foreigners”. Strong words, all within the context of Brexit and where it stemmed from. But, if I apply this to how nationalism pertains to I me as a Scot, then I’m not happy and, in fact, can see trouble ahead.  READ MORE: Jim Duffy: I could be a Tory but here’s why Corbyn offers more hope            Nationalism is not a warm and fuzzy term. It might feel warm and fuzzy to the tartan tammy brigade, who watch Braveheart every month and like fudge and black pudding. For them, nationalism is a term that imbues a collective oneness. It has an over-arching theme of “we are in this together” – all for one and one for all, and all that. Let’s called this fuzzy nationalism.Yes, I can hear some Scottish Labour MSP using this phrase very soon at Holyrood. It should get her or him a great round of applause and table tapping. Many of the nationalists I know are Fuzzy-Nats. They go all goey at the thought of an independent Scotland. Never mind that we will all be skint for decades, at least we will all be chums. I think not.What nationalism really is all about is polarisation. It’s a straight binary option internally and externally. Externally, if Scotland ever became independent it is an easy one to see. We sit as a sovereign nation and try our very best to stand on our own two feet. We do deals with other nations and trade globally. I get this and can see it operating as part of a wider economic plan. But, it is the internal nationalism that will tear us apart. This is where I agree with Mandy and his meta-narrative on what it truly means to be a nationalist. Nationalism breeds contempt for others around you. We saw it in the Indyref campaign. Family member against family member right up to cities and regions being more “nationalistic” than others. It spews forth bile, taunts and acutely acerbic, negative language that pit one neighbour against another. This internal nationalism is corrosive and will only lead to no good, it could be argued.            READ MORE: Jim Duffy: World leaders need to find Ronald Reagan’s brainAs Scotland is a small country with only a handful of cities, each of these under a nationalist “regime” would compete to be the Number One. Please don’t think for one minute that Glasgow City Council would chum up with Dundee City Council, if there was money on the table. No, each city will embark on getting as much for itself as it possibly can. It will be survival of the fittest and pugilistic in nature. After all, everyone knows that currently, Glasgow makes the money, while Edinburgh banks it – right? And as for Dundee? It soaks money up. Let’s hope that V\u0026ampA thing makes a few headlines and a few bob. So, why would each city “share” what it has?  Certainly not too be patriotic.Don’t be fooled into believing that nationalism is a positive force for good. I accept that many Scots feel that nationalism is what they believe in and will vote for if the opportunity presents itself again. But, nationalism will then eat the country apart as we compete internally and become “clan-like” again in our mentality. If we are being honest, Aberdeen will probably build a wall around itself and want its own independence stating it has all the oil. You heard it hear first!So, maybe now is the time to listen to Lord Mandelson. I cannot believe I just said that to be honest. But, perhaps it’s time to reformat and re-frame nationalism with patriotism.  Would I vote for the Scottish Patriot Party? That depends. But, when we reference how we think about Scotland as an independent country, perhaps we should be thinking about patriotism that is more positive and not nationalism that could tear us all apart."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778456.1533307705!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish government accused of deceiving parents over p1 national testing","story":"        The Scottish Government has been accused of \"deceiving\" parents over national testing of Primary 1 pupils after it emerged youngsters are legally entitled to  withdraw from the controversial assessments.                Email correspondence from civil servants released through Freedom of Information has revealed  “there is no legal requirement” to sit the exams.            The Liberal Democrats, who released the emails, claim this contrasts with official guidance on the tests, which make no mention of opting out.            Schools and local authorities have also claimed the exams are mandatory, according to parents.It emerged this week many children have been left in tears over the tests, with teachers also critical of them.Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: “Parents have the right to withdraw their children from national testing.“However, the SNP Government hasn’t lifted a finger to tell them and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from parents about this. They have set out to deceive parents and people will be appalled by this.“The Government hasn’t told parents anything and stonewalled them when they asked directly. They have done everything possible to give the impression that they are mandatory when they aren’t.”            The email releases show Scottish Government civil servant David Yeung responding to questions from Glasgow City Council about the rights of parents to withdraw youngsters from the exams.“There is no legal requirement to sit the SNSA,” Mr Yeung states.“On that basis the children can be withdrawn.”The Lib Dems point to the release of hundreds of complaints from teacher and parents about the Primary 1 tests.            Among these were parents who say they were not given a straight answer when asked if the testing was mandatory, but instead told “the Scottish Government’s expectation is that all children in P1, P4 P7 and S3 will undertake the standardised assessments”.Scottish national standardised assessments (SNSA) were introduced to help measure the attainment gap in schools.Teaching union Educational Institute of Scotland submitted more than 170 pages of comments from its members to ministers.The body will discuss the issue with its members when they return from school holidays later this month.Education secretary John Swinney has insisted the tests were required to establish a baseline so the progress of youngsters in future years could be measured.            He said: “Standardised assessments help teachers check progress in development and behaviour and identify where additional support may be required. That is particularly valuable in early years if we are to continue to close the attainment gap.“Assessment is already part of everyday learning and teaching, and our approach was developed after extensive engagement with teachers, parents, children and academics.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777988.1533285768!/image/image.jpg","title":"sir ming campbell condemns snp s despicable targeting of charles kennedy","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Lib Dem grandee yesterday waded into the row over Ian Blackford’s treatment of Mr Kennedy when he defeated him in the 2015 general election.            Mr Blackford, now the SNP’s Westminster leader, has been criticised for the way the campaign was conducted at a time when Mr Kennedy was battling alcoholism. Mr Kennedy died a few weeks after losing his Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat to Mr Blackford.            Yesterday Sir Menzies, who as Lord Campbell of Pittenweem sits in the House of Lords, said: “The campaign against Charles Kennedy by the SNP was the most despicable that I can remember in any election since 1974 when I first stood for parliament. I simply don’t buy the argument that the candidate knew nothing about what was going on. Responsibility for the conduct of a campaign in every case rests with the candidate and if he or she does not accept that obligation then they should not be standing. “What’s more, it is inconceivable that the Nationalist high command did not know what was going on and must take responsibility for what took place in the constituency.”The controversy over the SNP’s conduct in Ross, Skye and Lochaber was reignited this week when friends of Mr Kennedy took issue with comments made by Mr Blackford in a weekend interview. Mr Blackford said he was proud of the SNP’s campaign and said he respected Mr Kennedy as an “outstanding” parliamentarian. He claimed to have no regrets about the campaign when Mr Kennedy died because there was “absolutely no issue” between him and the late Lib Dem. He went on to claim the Lib Dems ran a “nasty” campaign against him, which he did not blame Mr Kennedy for. His remarks led to the former Labour MP Brian Wilson accusing Mr Blackford of an “odious attempt to rewrite history”. He said Mr Blackford had launched the hashtag “#where’sCharlie?” which unleashed a torrent of abuse from SNP supporters.Last night a SNP spokesperson said: “Neither the campaign nor Ian Blackford made personal attacks. Ian considers these issues were settled following the election three years ago and they have only resurfaced following a journalist’s questions. Ian Blackford has nothing further to add on these matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It could be the nets have snagged on the bottom. There could be a wreck and they\u0026#8217ve torn their net, and the net has come clear.\u0026#8221It\u0026#8217s not his fault if he\u0026#8217s lost a bit of his net.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!!

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bressay ferry service suspended ","story":"\n\nThe incident occurred at around 11am after the vessel experienced an engine failure while approaching the berth.\n, took the boat under tow and brought her back to berth in Lerwick where the vehicles on board had to reverse off.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nFriday 3 Aug 2018 7:37 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sleat-and-Strath.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

Everything will be included in the exhibition at the end of the project.”\n\nThe Caravan Gallery has recently spoken at The Martin Parr Foundation on its approach to engaging communities and has

paisley by election petition to be set up in three north antrim towns","story":"\nThe petition to remove Ian Paisley as North Antrim MP and force a by-election will be available for signing at three locations in the constituency, it has been confirmed.\n\n                \nIn a public notice in today’s News Letter, the Electoral Office reveals that the petition will be available to sign in north Antrim’s three main towns – Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nIan Paisley has vowed to stand again for election if he is forced into a by-election\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMembers of the public who want to force a by-election – in which Mr Paisley has made clear he will stand for re-election – will be able to sign from 9am next Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition will be open to sign until 5pm each week day at the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney, the Seven Towers Leisure Centre in Ballymena and the Sheskburn House Recreation Centre in Ballycastle.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe petition will remain open to sign for six weeks, until 19 September.\n\nThere will also be evening signings – something required by the legislation governing recall petitions – on September 6 and 13, when the petition can be signed up until 9pm.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea – who is responsible for the process – had discretion under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to designate up to 10 locations within the constituency for the petition to be signed.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has clarified that Ian Paisley has not left the party after some confusion yesterday in the wake of Parliament redesignating the North Antrim MP as an independent.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe party confirmed that Mr Paisley remained suspended, rather than having been expelled, and as part of that the party had withdrawn the whip from him.\n\nThat puts him in the same category as MPs such as Ivan Lewis, who is suspended by Labour and is listed as an independent.\n\nThe recall process was automatically triggered when Mr Paisley was given a suspension of 30 sitting days – the longest on record since at least 1949 – over “serious misconduct” relating to taking free luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then lobbying on behalf of the regime without declaring that they had given the valuable gifts to himself and his family.\n\nThe DUP veteran apologised for not declaring the holidays but insisted to Parliament’s standards commissioner that his letter asking the prime minister to change UK policy at the UN to that favoured by Sri Lanka did not amount to lobbying for the regime.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition to remove Mr Paisley will have to be signed by 7,547 people – 10% of the eligible North Antrim electorate – if there is to be a by-election.\n\nUnlike the situation with an election, any voter – not just those who can provide a legitimate reason for not being able to vote in person – will be able to apply to sign the petition by post.\n\nThat rule, about which DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has expressed concern, is in place because, unlike an election, it will be known that anyone going into the signing place will be there to sign the petition, reducing the typical anonymity around an election.\n\nParties wanting to campaign for people to sign the petition will have to register if they are planning to spend more than £500.\n\n

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix.

I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast international airport apologises for further security delays","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Email digital.editorial@belfasttelegraph to tell us your story.\n\n\nOne caller called Gary, who was travelling back to Liverpool on Thursday, said: \"I was visiting family and friends back home, because I live over in England, and we were getting the first flight out of Belfast yesterday.\n\n\"We got there about 6.30am and we were greeted with big, big queues at security at the bottom of the escalator at the stairs, that is where it started.\"\n\nHe said it took him an hour and a half to get through security and just about made his flight.\n\nAsked how he felt about the situation, he said: \"Frustrated, angry. [It is] not just myself, but other people pay a lot of money to go through and travel to different places.\n\n\"They offer a service, the airport, and to be honest the service is not up to standard.\n\n\"Lots of people, luckily not ourselves, may miss their flights. It is frustration and nervousness that you might miss your flight as well.\"\n\nGary said that no members of staff at the airport approached passengers to inform them of what was happening.\n\nHe added: \"You have to question whether they have the capacity, and whether they will have the capacity in the future in order to ensure that there is that smooth transition.\n\n\"I have got friends who do business in Northern Ireland from England and in recent months they have found it a real hassle to get across.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast International Airport\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said it has experienced difficulties over recent months as it worked to accommodate \"unprecedented passenger numbers\".\n\nThe spokesman said: \"Thursday morning was particularly challenging as our security provider, ICTS, experienced staffing issues which meant that not all lanes were available.\n\n\"We apologise to passengers who experienced delays, and would assure them that we are taking steps to address the issue.\n\n\"We have drafted in additional qualified staff from outside Northern Ireland who are working alongside every available member of airport staff to minimise delays.\n\n\"Belfast International Airport is addressing individual passenger complaints involving, in certain cases, claims for compensation.\n\n\"We would continue to appeal to passengers to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their scheduled departure times, and to pay particular attention to well-publicised advice on the items they can and cannot bring through Central Search.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lack of volunteers puts an end to northern irelands longestrunning ulsterscots fest","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

A lack of volunteers meant it became impossible to continue.\n\n\"We had considered ending the festival a couple of years ago, but the fact that the 25th anniversary was approaching seemed to galvanise people and we were able to continue, but those volunteers have backed away again.\n\n\"There is a possibility we will look at something smaller in years ahead to mark the first week of September and keep it going in some form, but there would need to be a willingness from the community to get involved.\"\n\nChief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency Ian Crozier said: \"The reality is that it\u0027s difficult for any festival to find the resources to keep going.\n\n\"As an agency we were already under the impression that last year was to be the final year in Ballycarry, and while that\u0027s disappointing, it\u0027s understandable given the shortage of resources, particularly manpower.\n\n\"We have put a lot of resources the way of Ballycarry with regards to the Ulster-Scots heritage and hope to be able to continue that in the future.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new armed forces chiefs pledge over vexatious claims is insulting sinn fein","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Absolutely not.”\n\nSinn Fein Mid Ulster MLA Linda Dillon described his comments as “extremely insulting and hurtful”.\n\nShe also challenged Sir Nick to meet with families who have made claims over the actions of soldiers.\n\n\n\u0027British Chief of the Defence Staff comments extremely insulting to families and victims of the conflict\u0027 - Dillon \nhttps://t.co/WqZloJ7QxK\n .\n@LindaDillon81\n \npic.twitter/jb07k2KrTR\n\n— Sinn Féin (@sinnfeinireland) \nAugust 3, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“I would call on the British Chief of the Defence Staff to provide evidence of any such ‘vexatious claims’,” Ms Dillon said.\n\n“These comments are extremely insulting and will provide further hurt to families and victims of the conflict, some of whom have waited over 40 years for closure by way of an Article 2 investigation or inquest or the timely provision of disclosure in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death of their loved ones.\n\n“During the conflict, state forces operated with impunity and we will resist any attempt to legalise this policy, which constituted an integral aspect of the British government’s sustained abuse of the human rights of Irish citizens both during and after the conflict.”\n\nHowever, Ulster Unionist MLA and former soldier Doug Beattie praised the comments from Sir Nick.\n\n“I welcome General Sir Nick Carter’s statement that ‘It is right and proper that if our soldiers have done something wrong then they should clearly be investigated’,” he said.\n\n“We need to have standards we need to have values that people are held against otherwise we will lose the moral high ground.\n\n\n\nThere will also be a welcome for General Sir Nick Carter’s assertion that ‘what is fundamentally wrong though is if they’re chased by people who are making vexatious claims - and that will not happen on my watch\u0027\nDoug Beattie, Ulster Unionist MLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“There will also be a welcome for General Sir Nick Carter’s assertion that ‘what is fundamentally wrong though is if they’re chased by people who are making vexatious claims – and that will not happen on my watch’.\n\n“The position we start from in Northern Ireland is one of imbalance. Terrorists have been able to avail of early release from prison, royal prerogatives of mercy or royal pardons, and over 200 ‘letters of comfort’ by the Blair government.\n\n“Too many people have lost sight of the fact that 99% of victims during the Troubles were due to terrorist action, and just 1% of the 47,000 victims were due to the police or army. And unlike the security forces, every terrorist act was premeditated with unlawful death the intended outcome.”\n\nSir Nick’s comments came after his predecessor said he was “deeply uncomfortable” at the prospect of veterans facing investigation for actions which occurred during the Troubles.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, who stepped down as Chief of the Defence Staff in June, said it was a political decision as to whether there should be a statute of limitations on inquiries into past events.\n\nBut he made clear that he was concerned at the way such investigations could play out.\n\nA consultation document issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles does not include provision for a statute of limitations, to the anger of many Conservative MPs.\n\nBut Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has pledged to look at “all options” to protect veterans from legacy investigations amid fears Second World War campaign survivors could be targeted.\n\nSir Nick said service personnel facing investigation would receive as much help as they needed.\n\nHe continued: “The point I’d make is that we as an institution … are absolutely going to look after those people who are being investigated this way, to the best of our ability.\n\n“A lot of people have got a lot of opinions about that and that’s part of the consultation – and I think it would be wrong for me to prejudge which direction it went in.\n\n“I think it is sad this is happening.\n\n“I think that of course there is a process of consultation going on at the moment and I don’t really want to prejudge where that consultation goes.”\n\nWriting in The Daily , Ms Bradley warned that implementing a statute of limitations could let terrorists off the hook.\n\nShe said: “Some have called for a statute of limitations for veterans, but we believe that is not legally possible without extending it to the terrorists – something this Government could not support.”\n\nThe minister hit out at attempts by some to “rewrite the history of the Troubles to justify terrorism” and warned investigators of unsolved killings, including murders of soldiers, that they are legally obliged to act in a fair, balanced and proportionate way.\n\nMs Bradley said she understood concerns over the treatment of veterans “in what some see as the apparently disproportionate focus on their actions rather than those of the terrorists”.\n\n“We should never forget that 90% of the killings were carried out by terrorists and just 10% by those acting on behalf of the state – almost all of the latter lawfully,” she said.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018 belfast out on the roof summer","story":"\n Hi

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc radios today show loses 800000 listeners in just","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

figures. \n\nThis a significant decrease from the 7.66 million who were tuning in during the second three months of 2017, and a slight dip on the 7.07 million who were listening every week in the first three months of 2018. \n\nThe last time the Today programme\u0027s listenership was lower was in the first quarter of 2016, when its weekly reach was 6.76 million. \n\nThe fall in Today\u0027s figures mirror those of Radio 4 as a whole, which has shed a million listeners in the past year, pulling in 10.60 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to 11.55 million in 2017 and 10.92 million last quarter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the BBC said: \"BBC Radio 4 Today is compulsory morning listening for seven million people who tune in each week for in depth reporting and agenda-setting interviews.\n\n\"There were record figures last year as the nation turned to Today during significant news events such as the general election, terror attacks in Manchester and London, and the Grenfell Tower fire.\n\n\"Audience figures fluctuate for news programmes across TV and radio in line with news events and the latest Today figures show a sustained loyal listenership and an overall increase since 2014.\" \n\nThe figures comes shortly after it was revealed the salaries of the Today programme presenters have undergone a shake-up over the past year, according to the BBC\u0027s new annual report. \n\nHumphrys has taken a notable pay cut, along with a number of BBC men, in response to the corporation\u0027s gender pay gap dispute. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"5 weird ways to keep

Vibrating throat muscles\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings may get a little awkward if you want to try this out on public transport, but birds have a neat little trick that helps them cool down. \n\nIt involves vibrating the muscles and bones in the throat. The term for this is gular fluttering and its purpose is to help regulate body temperature by causing water to evaporate in the throat membranes when exposed to air.\n\nPelicans, doves, owls and nighthawks are among many birds that use gular fluttering.\n\nAs Laura Erickson of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology tells bird conservation organisation the \nNational Audubon Society\n, gular fluttering makes birds “much more efficient about water and water loss”.\n\n2. Rolling in the mud\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that does not float your boat, then you could take a cue from pigs, hippos and wild boars and try rolling in the mud instead. \n\nThe science behind the mud bath is that it allows water to evaporate from the skin and carry the heat with it, cooling down the body.\n\nAlso, as water in mud evaporates more slowly than clear water, it means the animals can stay cool for longer.\n\nIt is probably worth pointing out that unlike us, pigs don’t have sweat glands. Although \nresearch\n from 2011 suggests that pigs’ penchant for wallowing in the mud is more of a wellbeing choice as much as it is about temperature regulation. \n\nThe theory is that functional sweat glands did not evolve in the animals because wallowing was a part of their lifestyle.\n\n3. Sleeping when it’s hot\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be all too familiar with heat-induced insomnia but one way to keep cool would be to sleep during the hottest part of the day. \n\nIt’s popular in the animal kingdom – crocodiles, snails and desert tortoises do it. This state of dormancy is known as aestivation – where animals sleep through the heat – the exact opposite of hibernation. \n\nAestivation helps animals survive by slowing their metabolism, which means they don’t need to eat as much during hot months. \n\nIt also helps prevent creatures like snails from drying out. \n\nSome amphibians like the lungfish and the cane toad move underground to aestivate where it is cooler and more humid.\n\n4. Panting\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve definitely seen dogs do it. \n\nPanting allows pups to rapidly expel hot air and draw in cooler air. When this cool air passes through the moist lining of the dogs’ nasal passages, mouth and lungs, it brings down the body temperature.\n\nDogs have a typical resting respiratory rate of 18 to 34 breaths per minute, but this rate can get significantly faster while panting.\n\nThey also sweat through their paw pads, but it is panting that circulates the air that helps them cool down.\n\nPooches also pant when they are startled by loud noises such as thunder – and in those instances may feel the need to hide under the bed. \n\n5. Shedding\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the hot weather, some animals – like cats and dogs – shed their dense coat of winter fur for a lighter option.\n\nShedding, which is triggered by hormonal changes, allows less heat to be trapped in the animal’s body and helps it cool off.\n\nThrough thousands of years of evolution, humans lost their thick body hair, allowing us to make technological advances like making clothes and building fires and reducing the need for that extra insulation.\n\nBut those looking to reducing body heat even more could try their luck with the razor – although chances are we don’t have enough body hair for it to meaningfully affect our temperature.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brutally honest advert for this familys old van actually helped to make a sale","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
