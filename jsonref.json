The plot of land was unwanted by architects and developers because of its size and shape          The first floor is where the family spends most of their time, in a large open-plan kitchen and living room. It leads out onto one of the two courtyard gardens          The large kitchen is fitted out in a retro style, with pale green kitchen cabinets and a parquet floor. There are two tables that accommodate their large familiesMr Lazarus, an architect, said it took them almost five years to get past red tape after they purchased the plot before they were able to start building work in 2016.It then took another two years before their creation on the 12ft by 216ft plot was finally built, the Evening Standard reports.   Mr Lazurus, who paid £240,00 for the site, said: \u0027One of the challenges was to build something where the spaces felt well-proportioned.\u0027It felt like a lot of money to be handing over. I remember thinking, Oh my God, what have I done?\u0027 The couple also wanted to \u0027give something to the street\u0027 so they made the bricks \u0027shine\u0027 with parts of the front of the property covered in mirror cladding. It makes the house glitter at night under street lights, and people often stop to take photographs.          A brightly lit hallway leads into the sizeable kitchen. The floor to ceiling glass doors maintain the sense of space felt throughout the property          The central staircase from the ground floor of the house. The property was built in two parts with the shell built first, which took a year and cost just over £300,000.

The shell was built first, which took a year and cost just over £300,000. By the start of last year they had a structure with a roof, windows, a staircase and walls.They then spent another £200,000, hiring builders to finish installing the flooring, plastering the walls, plumbing and fitting the three bathrooms and kitchen. Just before Christmas Mr Lazurus and his family were able to move into the house.          In daylight the front of the house looks like a dark and textured tower thanks to the brickwork. It means at night the street lights make it glitter  The unusual design of the building makes it stand out from the rest of the street in Hackney, east London. Mr Lazurus says that at night time people often stop to take pictures as the building twinkles in street lights          The three bedroom property has a large open plan kitchen and living room and a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system which sucks in fresh air from outdoors. This is a view of one of the living spaces on the first floor          The house makes the most of its space, with built-in desks and shelves in the hallway.

That\u0027s what my focus is on.\u0027Asked again, she said: \u0027If we leave — if we get to the point of no deal, we\u0027re making the preparations because we don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to come out of the negotiations. \u0027If we leave with no deal, we as the United Kingdom government are still committed to doing everything we can to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u0027The problem of the Irish border has proven to be the thorniest issue in the Brexit talks - threatening to derail them altogether.Both the British government and the EU have insisted that the border must remain soft amid fears that a return to border guards and checks could reignite the sectarian violence which blighted the regions for decades, killing thousands.The PM says her Chequers plan - which would see the UK stick to EU rules on goods but maintain the right to erge - is the only the plan to keep the border soft.    Theresa May (pictured today at the Tory Party conference in Birmingham with her closest aides) has always insisted that she will do everything she can to avoid imposing customs checks and border controls on the stretch of landBut EU leaders have rejected her plan in a major humiliation for the Prime Minister.Instead they have demanded that Northern Ireland stay in the EU\u0027s single market and customs union if no Brexit deal can be done that keeps a soft Irish border.This has been categorically rules out by Mrs May - who has pointed out it would slap a customs border in the Irish Sea between the UK.She has said that this is a plan that no British Prime Minister can support as it harms the territorial integrity of the UK. Bit Mr Hammond\u0027s remarks will spark fury among Brexiteers who have insisted that the question of the Irish border has been overblown in the Brexit talks.They have said that the UK should simply refuse to put up a hard Irish border. "},{"url":null,"title":"New Zealand company adopt four day working week time trial","story":"    Perpetual Guardian CEO Andrew Barnes (pictured) said there were \u0027no downsides\u0027 to the new systemAccording to a panel of academics who studied the effects on Perpetual Guardian\u0027s employees, workers showed lower stress levels, higher levels of job satisfaction and an improved sense of work-life balance.  Workers will now be given the option of whether or not to opt into the new scheme, with those who opt to stick to a five-day structure given other benefits such as shorter working hours.\u0027For us, this is about our company getting improved productivity from greater workplace efficiencies… there\u0027s no downside for us,\u0027 Barnes said. \u0027The right attitude is a requirement to make it work – everyone has to be committed and take it seriously for us to create a viable long-term model for our business.\u0027 Armed police revolt against bosses after being ¿hung out to...It\u0027s bear-y nice to meet you all! 12 panda cubs born this...Boris mocks Theresa by running through a \u0027field of wheat\u0027:...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/20/50A2E2A400000578-0-image-a-21_1538508930885.jpg","title":"Columbus Day 2018 celebrated federal holiday","story":"This Is Us spoilers: Do Toby and Kate get orced?BFI London Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to know about the 62nd BFI LFFFortnite season 6 searches on Pornhub doubled after launchThe 5 senators who will decide Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s fate revealedEuroMillions results: National lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 2Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash: All you need to know about Freeform\u0027s reunion specialColumbus Day 2018: When is it, how is it celebrated and is it a federal holiday?New on Netflix Australia in October 2018: All the new movies and TV shows revealedWorld Mental Health Day 2018: Everything you need to know What\u0027s on HBO in October 2018?

Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in most circumstances in the U.S.Kavanaugh had previously stated that the Roe v. Wade decision was ‘settled law’ in the country.The Maine Senator previously voted to confirm Kavanaugh after he was nominated by former President George W. Bush for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006.Despite her previous confirmation vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Collins has faced intense pressure to vote against his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. A group of progressive activists has reportedly raised more than $1.75 million (£1.3m) in crowdfunding and vowed to release the funds to her future campaign opponents if she indeed votes in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Both the campaign funds and confirmation vote could have a key impact on Collins’s future Senate race, as polls reportedly showed that Maine voters were less likely to support Collins if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh – even before the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced.Senator Lisa Murkowski – Republican from AlaskaMurkowski, much like Collins, has become known as one of the leading moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate.The 61-year-old Senator, who has been a member of the legislative chamber since 2002, has been known as an independent voice during her tenure, supporting abortion rights and, alongside Collins, helping to scuttle an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act signed by former President Barack Obama.Murkowski’s self-imposed test on the Kavanaugh confirmation vote comes, not from perilous reelection prospects – she’s not up for reelection until 2022 in a reliably Republican state – but whether women who allege that a sexual assault took place against them should be taken seriously.‘We are now in a place where it’s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified. It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed,’ she said.Murkowski, who soon joined fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake in calling for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, does indeed have a political balancing act to do ahead of the confirmation vote.The Senator has long been supported by Native Alaskans, whose backing of her could falter after it was revealed by Hawaii Senator Mazie K. Hirono that Kavanaugh appeared to question whether Native Hawaiians were a legitimate protected group.          Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has a history of crossing party lines in the U.S. SenateSenator Jeff Flake – Republican from ArizonaFlake, 55, has long been a thorn in President Trump’s side. A vocal critic of the President who’s served in the U.S. Senate since 2013 and previously in the U.S. House of Representatives, Flake’s vote is seen as crucial.Unencumbered by political pressure – he’s opted not to run for reelection this year – Flake has expressed support for Kavanaugh’s conservative views but cautioned that the confirmation process needs the support of the whole country, something very difficult in the face of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh and the polarized political climate that’s gripped the United States in recent years.‘I want to support him. I’m a conservative, he’s a conservative judge. But I want a process we can be proud of, and I think the country needs to be behind it,’ he said.Flake, who said that the testimonies of both Kavanaugh and Ford left him with ‘as much doubt as certainty,’ voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination but was also the first Republican Senator to call for an official FBI investigation to the allegations made against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.He’s made his views known that he intends to ultimately vote to confirm Kavanaugh unless the ongoing investigation turns up evidence the nominee lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee or engaged in unlawful sexual conduct.Though he has a long history of bucking Trump’s demands, Flake did indeed vote to confirm the President’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.Senator Heidi Heitkamp – Democrat from North DakotaHeitkamp, 62, has served in the Senate since 2013 and is currently locked in a tight reelection battle in a state won easily by Trump.The North Dakota Senator, who previously voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, appeared to express at least some degree of support for Kavanaugh before the sexual misconduct allegations against him arose, even praising him as ‘highly-qualified’ for the position of Supreme Court Justice.However, the allegations against the nominee may have given Heitkamp pause.At a recent campaign stop in Grand Forks, North Dakota, she said that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be something that’s ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ and also blasted her campaign opponent, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, for being critical of Ford’s allegations, denouncing the congressman as someone who has ‘a stunning lack of empathy for victims and the trauma they experience.’She’s also backed the ongoing FBI probe centered on the allegations made against Kavanaugh, saying: ‘We need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law enforcement agency to do its job’  Heidi Heitkamp, left, is currently locked in a close reelection battle with Kevin Cramer, rightSenator Joe Manchin – Democrat from West VirginiaManchin, a 71-year-old conservative Democrat, is also facing reelection in a state overwhelmingly won by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Having first joined the Senate in 2010, Manchin voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017 and has sided with Republicans on a number of issues.However, the West Virginia Senator has cited healthcare as a key deciding factor for him when it comes to Kavanaugh’s nomination, as he’s said that he’d like to see U.S. courts preserve the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans suffering with preexisting conditions.So far, Manchin has dropped few hints as to whether he’d vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, but has stated that the judge had ‘all the right qualities’ after meeting with him earlier in 2018.Manchin has also backed the FBI investigation on the allegations made against Kavanaugh and has indicated he’d base his vote on the judge’s credentials if no evidence was found backing up the accusations made against Kavanaugh.‘If there’s nothing conclusive, then it’ll be based on the merits of him being qualified,’ he said. This Is Us spoilers: Do Toby and Kate get orced?BFI London Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to know about the 62nd BFI LFFFortnite season 6 searches on Pornhub doubled after launchThe 5 senators who will decide Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s fate revealedEuroMillions results: National lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 2Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash: All you need to know about Freeform\u0027s reunion specialColumbus Day 2018: When is it, how is it celebrated and is it a federal holiday?New on Netflix Australia in October 2018: All the new movies and TV shows revealedWorld Mental Health Day 2018: Everything you need to know What\u0027s on HBO in October 2018?

The frustration only grew after she saw  hundreds of them parked up in a lot in Salt, Lake City, Utah          Elon Musk tweeted that there were problems with delivering cars to customers following this angry Tweet from a customerThe company announced Tuesday that it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter, marking a 50 percent increase over the previous quarter and when the company hit its target for the first time in the last week of June, some questioned whether the feat was sustainable.But it appears that there are other problems facing the company. Since July, Tesla has been parking anywhere from a couple of dozen to a few hundred cars at a lot in Burbank, California. It\u0027s a similar story in the town of Lathrop near San Francisco where Tesla has 400 cars at an industrial site according to the New York Times.Hundreds more have been located in in Antioch, northeast of San Fran. Last week, the newspaper reported that another batch of 100 Model 3s cars  in Bellevue, Washington with further batches in Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.Delta aircraft is evacuated after aborting its takeoff at...Who toppled the statue? Mystery in Philadelphia after...Share this article    The company has refused to comment on the reason for the surplus other than to say there were delivery problems at one stage          Some have suggested the full lots are because demand for Teslas isn\u0027t a great as the company advertises          Internet sleuths have taken to sending up drones and even flown in private planes to snap pictures of the parking lots containing dozens of the parked-up TeslasThe vehicles, which have all been parked on private property, have been uncovered by amateur detectives many of whom have flown drones over the parking lots to take pictures of the sitting cars.Another ended up taking to the skies in a private plane to snap hi-res photos from the air before posting them on Twitter. The sleuths are betting that Tesla\u0027s share price will fall and suggest Elon Musk has not been truthful about the company\u0027s current situation, particularly its sales numbers.The existence of such massive lots full of cars are likely proof that something is amiss at the company. A Tesla spokesman, Dave Arnold, said by email to the Times that the large lots of vehicles were \u0027logistics transit hubs\u0027 and added, \u0027Anyone observing those lots will see a change from one day to the next.\u0027           One photographer took to the skies in order to capture the cast numbers of cars sitting idle           Tesla Inc. vehicles sit in a parking lot outside of a newly constructed production tent at the company\u0027s manufacturing facility in Fremont, California           Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year - but then why are so many of the cars going nowhere? Production increases are something Musk worked nearly to exhaustion to achieve. He has publicly said he has been working as much as 120 hours per week and sometimes even slept on Tesla\u0027s factory floor in Fremont, California, to oversee the efforts to make more cars. The company even built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s.But doubts remain whether the company can continue to crank out enough vehicles to achieve profitability, something that still eludes Tesla.Although it successfully reached its production goals for the third quarter, getting those vehicles into the hands of consumers has proven to be a headache.Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year.But one other theory is that the presence of parking lots with hundreds of Teslas all parked up with no place to go, could mean that there is a delivery problem.          At one point, Elon Musk suggested that there was a shortage with hauliers transporting cars  CEO Elon Musk has pledged to work out the manufacturing problems that have raised questions about the electric car maker\u0027s future prospectsCustomers have been complaining that their Tesla delivery dates have been delayed over and over while vehicles sit unmoved in lots. One tweeted to Musk last month: \u0027There are 42 Tesla\u0027s sitting at the Union Pacific Railroad in SLC. My car is one of these. I\u0027ve been told I was getting delivery the 8th, then the 15th, then the 20th, then the 22nd, and now my delivery has been delayed indefinite. @Tesla @elonmusk... Please make this right.\u0027Musk tweeted back and acknowledged the problem: \u0027Sorry, we\u0027ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We\u0027re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly.\u0027Musk attributed the problem to a shortage of trucks to haul cars around the country but others disagree saying there is \u0027plenty of car haulage capacity.\u0027  \u0027The Auto Haulers Association of America is not aware of any shortage of car haulers, nor of any other automakers that are having trouble shipping new vehicles,\u0027 said  Guy Young from the organization.Musk has even said that Tesla has developed its own trailers to transport cars to customers but no new designs have been approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates such transporters.          The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Thousands are sitting in lots around the country          Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot featureEither way, it is clear that Tesla appears to have failed to set up an efficient way of delivering the hundreds of cars a day it is producing.The only other alternative is that demand is far less than Tesla is suggesting and the reason there are so many lots full of the costly cars is because there are simply no buyers.     Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance feature.More could be revealed in the coming days when Tesla reports production and delivery data for the last three months.But patience is wearing thin for people who have already put down $1,000 to get on a waiting list for the Model 3.Tesla has never turned an annual profit during its eight-year history and rarely done it on a quarterly basis, but it needs to reverse that trend to erase doubts about its survival.The company has been under mounting pressure to stop burning through cash with $1.3 billion of its more than $10 billion in debt due to be repaid during the next six months.Musk will give up his post as Tesla\u0027s chairman for at least three years after tweeting in August tweet that he would take the company private and had \u0027funding secured\u0027 for the deal.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Thursday that said the tweet constituted securities fraud because Musk knew he hadn\u0027t lined up the money for such a deal.Critics, including some investors, had pushed for similar changes recently, arguing that a new chairman and a board less tied to Musk would be good for Tesla and its investors. Some have argued Musk should even give up the CEO role and assume a post such as chief technical officer.The SEC said it wanted to bar Musk from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company, a scary option for investors who felt Musk was nearly synonymous with Tesla and that another executive would have trouble managing Tesla\u0027s manufacturing challenges and keeping the public satisfied in spite of Tesla\u0027s substantial debts.Unraveling a Tesla Mystery: Lots (and Lots) of Parked Cars - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/18/50EDE65100000578-0-image-m-30_1538501234483.jpg","title":"A day life Gisele Coconut oil sun gazing aromatherapy foot massages kids","story":"    Gisele Bundchen, 38, the supermodel wife of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, has just published new book Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life - which details her daily routine, workout regime, diet and meditation schedule          She and Brady are parents to son Benny, 8, and daughter Vivi, 5, as well as the athlete\u0027s older son, Jack, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan          Gisele writes her day starts between 5am and 6am, when she rises to \u0027ocean\u0027 sounds on her phone she then spends up to 15 minutes swilling coconut oil in her mouth in a process known as \u0027pulling\u0027     Gisele, a native of Brazil, married Brady in 2009 the model writes: \u0027It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive\u0027          Gisele, pictured in the web television series Tom vs Time, lives outside of Boston with Brady and their family, in addition to enjoying a property in Montana\u0027s exclusive Yellowstone Club - which featured heavily in the program          Gisele says her children perform daily chores, and she emphasizes cleaning she likes to leave \u0027rooms as tidy as I found them\u0027          Gisele writes in the book that she enjoys taking her children to school herself each night, she gives \u0027them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy.

It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive.‘This is why making a big deal out of little moments matters a lot to me.

When Tom his home, he kisses the kids good night and sometimes he tells them a story. At bedtime, I love reading out loud to each child.

Five minutes of foot rubbing really calms them down, and makes us feel close.‘The last thing I do before saying good night is to remind them to pray to their guardian angel. I often wait outside their rooms, listening to them saying their prayers, and it melts my heart every time.’Tom usually goes to bed by 9pm, she writes, whereas she can stay up as late as 10, though she showers before going to bed ‘especially if they used lots of product and my hair looks crazy.’ (It’s not exactly clear who ‘they’ are.’‘I need at least seven hours of sleep, eight if I can get it,’ she writes. ‘Thankfully I’ve never had any trouble falling asleep.

The left hands reveal their private sides.’Can this be true? We asked Helen to read these royal palms without knowing who they belonged to. The results were uncannily accurate...    The lines on the right hand represent the side the royals want to show the public. The left hands reveal their private sides, palm expert reveals 1. A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION          A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION: Feminine with long, willowy fingersThese hands are very feminine. From the long, willowy fingers, it’s clear these are the hands of a sensitive, artistic person. This is the most interesting royal palm thanks to a very unusual feature on the right hand, known as a Simian Line.Usually the Head Line and Heart Line are separate and spaced apart as they run into the centre of the palm. However, on this royal, it shows up as only one line which ides the hand in half horizontally.This special feature is known as a ‘gift marker’ —and reveals a person of enormous drive, energy and focus. Add this to the long, straight Heart Line on their left hand, it reveals a considerate person likely to be a humanitarian.This person will also need a mission which they can pour their energy into to be happy. This is not a royal who will want to hide behind the scenes, more someone who will take to the world stage and make a positive impact.Also, the equal length of ring and index fingers mean they really understand feelings which will also make them a good parent.2. CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD            CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD: Thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature sideThe thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature side, or perhaps a passion for food. The ruddy colour and bloated appearance of the hands also suggest this is a person who needs to pay more attention to their health. The Life Line is short too, suggesting low energy.The length of the fingers also show this is a royal who loves to talk.The slightly longer ring finger suggests they love a bit of appreciation and applause — if they weren’t a royal they could have been a celebrity food critic!Other markers show this royal may feel conflicted by the expectations of being a member of the Royal Family.For example, the Life Line and Head Line start and stay together for about an inch, so this person is comfortable following the traditions they’ve grown up with. However, this conflicts with the shortish middle finger, which suggests a desire to rebel or break ‘the rules’.That could mean this member of ‘The Firm’ is not sure how to get his needs met and still fit in with the expectations of his position.  3. THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE            THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE: Slightly longer ring fingers emphasis someone who can be quite analyticalThis royal has the fingers and palm of a thinker, someone who can be quite analytical, emphasised by her slightly longer ring fingers.This means she is probably quite visual and her appearance may be quite important. It also means this is someone who thrives on appreciation and applause!This royal holds their little finger off to the side, suggesting a highly private person who prefers not to expose their vulnerabilities.Both thumbs are held close to her palm, suggesting again they like to play their cards close to their chest.All in all, a strong inidual capable of restraint in pursuit of what she believes in.4. FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION          FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION: Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional valuesThe three lines, crossed by three others, at the bottom of this royal’s index finger, shows this is someone with very high standards.Like many royal palms, the Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional values. However, the short distance between the height of this person’s middle fingers and their index and ring fingers, shows they have a rebellious streak. This is likely to have shown up more in their youth.There are also four short parallel lines under the joint between the ring and little fingers. This is ‘the gifted healer’. It can mean someone who is inspirational in helping others.It’s possible this royal will have expressed this through charity work. 5. A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE          A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE: Area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plumpThe area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plump.This shows a person who likes to have fun and may have been a bit of a hedonist in their youth. This royal’s Heart Line is curvy, showing that they are naturally passionate.However, as the line straightens out towards the end, it suggests this person curbs their passionate nature, possibly out of duty.In both hands, the index, or pointer-finger, looks the strongest and has more of a ‘platform’ or fleshy pad. This suggests someone who has put a lot of energy into being in charge, carving out their turf and leading the way in what matters to them.As these qualities also show up on the left hand, this royal will be no walkover at home either — and that will help make them a good parent and partner. 6. CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE          CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE: Middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebelThe middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebel.This person also has a light, horizontal line joining the Head and Heart line. This means it’s hard for them to decide whether to go with their heart or logic. A slightly upward curving Heart Line shows a caring character who tries to do the right thing, even if their inner rebel sometimes gets them into trouble.The way their vertical Fate Line — also known as a Saturn Line — underneath the middle finger stops at the Head Line shows this side probably kicks in when they get bored.The little finger is long, suggesting this is a person who probably loves to talk.The ring at the base of their little finger, covering the bottom segment — the intimacy zone — also shows this person wants to protect themselves from being hurt emotionally.7. A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE          A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE: A square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done’ This royal has a square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done.’His Head Line is the straightest and least curved of them all, revealing this is the most logical person in the family.There is also a Fate Line which goes up vertically through his palm towards his middle finger.This shows someone who is a doer who follows through.This royal’s Head Line is long and straight and stretches into his zone of intuition — the plumper area down the side of your palm opposite the thumb.Our hands can change over time.If this line keeps developing, it will mean this royal is going to start combining logic with intuition.This will help them see things from many different perspectives.The long little fingers show this person is a really strong communicator, while the thick, strong index fingers show he will also be very persuasive.Whoever this person is, they are going to be great asset to the Royal Family.8. ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS          ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS: Complex, masculine hands, full of contradictionsThese are complex, masculine hands, full of contradictions.They look like the stubby-fingered hands of a traditional ‘builder’, solid, rough and earthy.The Life Line is deeply etched and long, showing this person has lots of energy.There is also a well-developed ‘intimacy area’ in the bottom segment of the little finger.This is someone who can share deeply with others. There are criss-crosses too in this person’s Moon Zone, at the base of the palm opposite the thumb.What this means is it’s someone who has tried lots of different mystical things.However, looking at the really short middle segment of the little fingers, this is also a person who doesn’t do negotiation.The approach is: ‘It’s my way or the highway.’9. STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGY             STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGYThis is a strong powerful palm of an older royal in the shape of a long rectangle, a sign of a person who thinks things through.There is also a strong Fate Line that stretches up vertically through their hand, showing this is someone who finishes what they start.These are also balanced hands with strong, straight fingers, which is a sign of an ethical person with a sense of self who is comfortable with their personal power.The slightly longer index finger shows they like to be in charge.They have a passionate Heart Line on both hands. So they will prioritise what they believe is important over and above other people’s feelings and needs.Their Life Line is deep and long showing they have extraordinary energy reserves.The combination of all these factors suggests a person with a clear sense of their own place in the world, something that may have served this royal well over their lifetime. 10. A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE          A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVEOn this palm, the Fate Line stops at the Heart Line.We call this The Grand Gesture — and it’s a sign of someone who will give up everything for love.However, unlike most of the other royals, the Head and Life Lines are not tied together at the start.This shows this is someone who likes to make up their own mind.Also, unlike many of the other royal hands, there isn’t a ‘platform’ where the index finger meets the palm, which is often a sign of someone who likes being in charge.However, there is a ‘platform’ underneath the ring finger on the left palm, which is her private side.This shows this royal is happiest being the boss at home, while others — perhaps a partner — take the limelight in public.AND THE ANSWERS ARE...           "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/03/01/50F1708100000578-0-image-m-13_1538525705336.jpg","title":"Shaun Walmsley serve extra eight years bars","story":"Shaun Walmsley (pictured left and right, after 18 months on the run), 29, was already serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years behind bars when two men, armed with an Uzi submachine gun and a knife, threatened to shoot and \u0027cut\u0027 his three prison guards, before snatching him outside Aintree Hospital in the city in February 2017After he was repeatedly tasered and dragged out of a car he told the officers \u0027Good job boys!\u0027, Liverpool Crown Court heard.He was given a minimum 30 years in June 2015 for the brutal stabbing of rival drug dealer Anthony Duffy, 33.Tragedy for Red Symons as his son, 27, dies from cancer...Terrified British tourists run and hide after gunmen open...Share this articleAfter receiving news his appeal had been refused Walmsley hatched the prison escape by deliberately losing weight and feigning illness.Walmsley had a consultation at the hospital on February 8 last year, where he was told he would undergo a minor endoscopy procedure on February 21 - and was able to plot his bid for freedom.The defendant on Tuesday pleaded guilty to a single count of escape from custody.          Walmsley spent 18 months on the run from HMP Liverpool before he was captured in a pre-planned operation by armed police in Leeds in AugustJudge Clement Goldstone, Recorder of Liverpool, told the defendant if he thought another sentence would make no difference as he was already serving life, \u0027you could not be more wrong\u0027.He was told although he is only eligible for parole in June 2047 after that sentence finishes, he must serve another eight years - half of it in jail - before release.The judge added: \u0027After undergoing your procedure you were, to use the vernacular, sprung by two men who had parked a car nearby.\u0027Each was armed one with a machine gun the other a knife and gas canister.\u0027I have no doubt over the months you began to think by a combination of disguise, re-location and friends in low places you had become above the law and would remain at large indefinitely.\u0027But Merseyside Police had other ideas.

Kennedy\u0027s privileged childhood and teen years, growing up with his eight siblings in Massachusetts and New York, and vacationing at the family homes in Hyannis Port and Palm Beach, Florida as well as abroad. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum recently made the Kennedy family photos available for viewing online after completing an 18-month project to catalog and digitize them.Born on May 29, 2017 in Brookline, an area outside of Boston in Massachusetts, Jack, as he was called by his family and friends, was named after his maternal grandfather, John Francis Fitzgerald, a former Congressman and mayor of Boston, who was known as ‘Honey Fitz’ for his charm and charisma. From a young age, the future 35th president would follow in his namesake\u0027s footsteps: Jack was considered a ‘natural wit’ to the point his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy wrote down things that he would say, according to Nigel Hamilton’s ‘JFK: Reckless Youth.’Jack would parlay that charisma and wit all the way to the highest office in the land, and along the way attend elite preparatory schools where he would win friends and titles such as \u0027Most Likely to Succeed\u0027 but not always academic accolades despite an inidualist mind that enjoyed to read. Jack battled being seriously ill off and on throughout his childhood and teens years, but remained amiable and was considered the family\u0027s joker. All of the Kennedy kids contended with their parents - Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. - contentious marriage as Kennedy Sr. had several affairs, including with actress Gloria Swanson, according to the book.Rose Kennedy would have nine children – four boys and five girls – and began a ‘card-index filing system to keep track of the children’s medical histories and vital statistics’, and had a ‘daily inspection’ where she ‘looked for signs of fraying garments,’ according to the book. Jack, the second eldest after his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., ‘seemed unconcerned about dress,’ Hamilton wrote, and was at times disheveled with his shirt not tucked into his pants.          Born on May 29, 1917, John F. Kennedy was the second eldest child of the Kennedy clan.

Jack was close to death but recovered, and would face spells of sickness throughout his childhood and his teens, according to the book.Meanwhile, the family moved to a new home: a ‘colonial-style mansion with two-story, curving bay windows, a wraparound porch, fourteen rooms and a garage for the new Rolls-Royce’ in Brookline, according to the book.Rare Kennedy photos go inside America\u0027s most famous family...\u0027Childlike innocence\u0027 of JFK\u0027s eldest sister Rosemary is...EXCLUSIVE: How the bitter rivalry between sisters Jackie...Share this articleJack and his older brother, Joe, who was named after their father, were rivals, and ‘when not engaged in fisticuffs with his older brother, Jack turned more and more to books,’ according to the book. Hamilton surmises that while being ill, Jack took up the habit of reading. By aged six, Jack was promoted to second grade, and the next year to third grade when he was seven - ‘a year if not two ahead of most children his age,’ according to the book.Meanwhile his sister, Rosemary, who was a year younger than him, was a slow learner and was ‘unable to hold a knife and fork at first,’ according to the book, and Rose spent more time with her than Jack. By October 22, 1994, while Jack is in third grade at the Edward Devotion School, he pulled out of that institution and sent, along with his older brother, Joe, then nine, to the $400 a year Noble and Greenough Lower School. The Kennedy boys were likely the only Irish Catholic family at the school where most were Protestant and Anglo-Saxon, and as new boys they were the ‘object of derision and taunts,’ according to the book.           John F.

John F. Kennedy (center) is on skis on the snow-covered slopes in Poland Spring, Maine circa 1923They were driven to school by a chauffeur in a big black shiny car, and both Jack, with his ‘precocious intellect,’ and his older brother Joe liked the school despite all the ‘social and ethnic prejudice they suffered,’ Hamilton wrote. Joe and Jack were also ‘steadfastly loyal to the ex-mayor,’ their grandfather Honey Fitz, and would go campaigning with him.Among Boston’s upper crust, a contemporary of the Kennedy boys, Augustus Soule, said in Hamilton’s book that they ‘were very down on the Irish’ and that his father would have nothing to do with Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who had made money ‘in ways that were known, in banking circles, to be unsavory.’Kennedy Sr. was a wealthy businessman who manipulated share prices, according to the book, and at one time owned production companies and tried his hand as a Hollywood impresario. It was during this period that Kennedy Sr., who was considered a womanizer, had an affair with icon and actress Gloria Swanson, according to the book.When Noble and Greenough Lower School faced calamity and was on the verge of closing, Kennedy Sr. stepped in with other families to financially save it, but not long after, in September 1927, the family moved to Riverdale, a wealthy residential neighborhood in the Bronx, and the Kennedy boys started class at the exclusive, nonsectarian Riverdale Country Day School, according to the book.The family would then move to a 12-bedroom colonial in nearby Bronxville in Westchester, and ‘at last acquired a summer house at Hyannis Port, on the east coast of Cape Cod,’ according to the book. The Kennedys would vacation often - in Hyannis Port, at their sprawling property in Palm Beach, Florida, and abroad.          Joseph P.

New York society circles continued to shun the Kennedys as ‘Irish micks’ and with the Swanson scandal, the Kennedys ‘found themselves even less accepted in polite society,’ according to the book.The ‘record of parental absenteeism shockingly high’ for the Kennedy kids, and the ‘general deterioration in the relationship between mother and father created an emotional wasteland,’ Hamilton wrote.On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashes, billions are lost and the United States is plunged into the Great Depression that follows. Kennedy Sr., however, ‘had shrewdly moved most of his investments out of stocks,’ according to the book.Joe is sent to the Choate School, the elite boarding school in Connecticut, while Jack attended a boarding school in New England called the Canterbury School. At 13, Jack has an appendectomy, and would leave Canterbury to follow his older brother at Choate, according to the book. Unlike Joe, Jack had a hard time conforming to the rules and struggled academically at Choate, and Hamilton said Jack\u0027s four years at the boarding school were ‘grueling.\u0027 Jack was popular with his classmates and had a reputation for ‘wit and clownishness,\u0027 and ‘on one occasion Jack stole a life-size cardboard cutout of Mae West from the Wallingford cinema and slipped it into his bed to shock the cleaning woman the following morning,’ according to the book.          The Kennedy children had several governesses growing up, and their father, Joseph P.

She had ventured abroad seventeen times in four years, but could not manage the journey to Connecticut, where Jack lay in the hospital further north,’ Hamilton wrote.Jack would bounce back again, and once healthy, would form a group called ‘The Muckers Club’ at Choate, which wasn’t about smoking or drinking but rather about planning pranks. Jack and the other members were almost expelled for a proposed prank but the headmaster reconsidered the punishment, which would have dashed the boys\u0027 Ivy League ambitions, according to the book.Kennedy Sr. pushed his children to be competitive with a winning is everything mentality, according to the book, and a school friend said that while at first the Kennedys appeared to be a ‘model family,’ over time, the \u0027storybook façade concealed an almost psychotic drama, with Mrs. Kennedy eclipsed by her ruthless, bullying husband and the tension of that unspoken interparental hostility pervading everything. The competitiveness Mr. Kennedy generate among his nine children was awesomely fascinating.’Hamilton added: ‘Perhaps most damaging of all was the sexual example Joseph Kennedy set for his children. Jack came home from school to having his father cover his bed with pornographic magazines ‘all open to display the female anatomy at its most immodest.’Jack would vie for ‘Most Likely to Succeed’ at Choate and win. By the summer of 1935, Jack found out that he got into Harvard and would be put on a path toward the presidency.          John F.

As two of them are now dead, she is affectionately known as the Black Widow and currently has a younger partner, five-year-old Jubilee. All I can do is wish him well.I have something of a troubled relationship with Munin. Sometimes I think she hates me.She has been giving me the run-around for years and, since research suggests that ravens can recognise human faces, I can only assume that I did something horrendous in my early days at the Tower for which she has never forgiven me.Woe betide the next fox that tries to eat a Tower of London...The \u0027Temple of Transportation\u0027 that Jackie Kennedy helped...Share this articleI started working here as a Yeoman Warder, as we Beefeaters are properly known, in 2005.All of us, servicemen and women, have long records of unblemished service — in my case, almost 25 years as an infantryman.That took me all over the world and eventually to the Tower of London, with its bloody history of murder, torture and, of course, ravens.Without them, the legend goes, great harm will befall the kingdom and the Tower itself will crumble into dust.      Tradition: Two ravens pictured in the Tower of London in the 1960sThe man had managed to capture Munin using only a holdall and a blanket — together with a thick pair of gardening gloves and some chicken legs to tempt her.Thanking him for helping us to save the kingdom, we placed Munin in her travel box and made our way back to the Tower, where I reflected on an important lesson. Never underestimate the ravens.I often try to see the Tower through their eyes: the sheer looming mass of the buildings, like cliffs, and the continual hubbub of sound, like the howl of the tundra all those potential playmates and the ever-present threat of predators.We will never know all of what goes on inside their heads but they certainly seem to have the capacity to remember.When Derrick Coyle visited the Tower some seven years after leaving as Ravenmaster, for example, Merlina came straight to him. It was as if he’d never been away. Seven years!Following my time in the Army, caring for the ravens has meant becoming a part of another family — learning to trust and be trusted —and doing what I can to the best of my ability when they need my help.And if you have enjoyed reading about my life with these remarkable creatures, perhaps I can ask a small favour.Years from now, long after our current ravens have gone, and I, too, have passed on to that great raven enclosure in the sky, you may be visiting the Tower. Perhaps there will be a raven there named after me, and this Skaife may be looking at you in that way only ravens can.Don’t get too close — he may bite. But say hello from me.Kn-ck, kn-ck.

The company has invested in a new factory in SlovakiaSpeculation about the size, shape and timing of the new generation Defender - the original Land Rover of 1948  - has been rife since its production ended with a series of collectors\u0027 special editions.The Defender began as the original Land Rover  and this year is celebrating its 70th anniversary.Loved by the Queen, driven by Winston Churchill and adored by millions loyal drivers including soldiers of the British Army and SAS - it was launched on April 30, 1948 at the Amsterdam Motor Show.The original Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out in the sand on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey the workhorse vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then using.          Shortly after the end of the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out the original Land Rover in the sand on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey, Wales          The vehicle was needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then usingSo in 1948 Britain\u0027s answer to the ubiquitous Jeep – the Land Rover - was born and launched at that year\u0027s Amsterdam Motor Show as the world\u0027s first mass-produced civilian 4X4 costing £450. With post-war rationing and steel in short supply but masses of aluminium around, the vehicle was initially made with the lightweight metal. The original sage-green paint was acquired from a fighter plane factory.The first pilot pre-production model was called \u0027Huey\u0027 after its registration number \u0027HUE 166\u0027 and is fully working.Astonishingly, some three-quarters of the 2 million Defenders ever built since then are said to be still in regular use.Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover.

Defenders are still used today by the Born Free Foundation whose founder Virginia McKenna OBE was in the movie. Hollywood actor Steve McQueen was a fan. It also featured in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the James Bond movie, Skyfall.The Defender name itself can be traced back to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover launched the previous year called Discovery.Military versions of the Defender have seen service around the globe and the armed forces have purchased almost 200,000 variants of the UK built Land Rover with the most famous being those used by the SAS in the desert, nicknamed \u0027pinkies\u0027 after their painted camouflage colour designed to blend with the dunes.To cheering and applause from the workforce at Land Rover\u0027s Solihull factory near Birmingham, the final Land Rover Defender 4X4 drove off the production line in January 2016 and joined the firm\u0027s heritage collection. A radical new generation Defender is to be launched next year.          The Defender became a regular movie star featuring heavily in the film Born Free (1966)          It featured in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the James Bond film SkyfallTo mark the final year of the classic Defender Land Rover launched a series of official special editions ranging in price from £27,800 to £61,845.At the Frankfurt Motor Show seven years ago Jaguar Land Rover signalled how potential hi-tech replacements for the Defender would look, unveiling a macho, open-topped off-roader - codenamed DS100 Sport - designed to be as useful off-road as the trusty original. It also showed off a more fun-packed version looking like a beach-buggy, as well as a more practical workhorse version.In January, Land Rover announced plans to \u0027sympathetically renovate\u0027 the world\u0027s most historically significant unrestored model – one of three pre-production cars from the original Amsterdam motor show launch on 30th April 1948.It will take the stage at the Land Rover Classic event alongside its closest modern relative – the 405PS Defender Works V8 revealed earlier this year, of which only 150 will be produced."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/22/05694822000007D0-6232139-Reality_TV_shows_like_Love_Island_are_dangerous_to_children_and_-a-1_1538515497714.jpg","title":"Headteacher asks girls MeToo seriously value nonsense","story":"    Jane Lunnon, headteacher of Wimbledon High School, has serious concerns about the effect social media and reality showsReality TV shows like Love Island sends an \u0027unbelievably dangerous\u0027 message to young people that could undermine the #MeToo movement, a head teacher has said.Jane Lunnon, head of Wimbledon High School, has serious concerns about the effect social media and reality shows have on body image and self worth.The headteacher thinks that if we want the #MeToo movement to be taken seriously, girls shouldn\u0027t celebrate \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture.  Speaking at the Headmasters\u0027 and Headmistresses\u0027 Conference\u0027s (HMC) annual autumn conference she said social media and reality stars are \u0027image-obsessed\u0027.Mrs Lunnon said: \u0027I was particularly struck by the Love Island thing - it wasn\u0027t just the way it dominated teen consciousness, it was the way it basically dominated public discourse.\u0027So what has happened that makes Love Island become something real and significant?          Reality TV shows like Love Island are \u0027dangerous\u0027 to children and could undermine #MeToo movementMrs Lunnon says young people might not be able to distinguish between what is real and what is fake.She said: \u0027The problem attached to that is what are the long-term consequences of a world where a) we are celebrating something essentially trivial, and b) we are focused, such relentless focus on appearance and the presentation of brand self - which we know is a spillover from social media itself.\u0027And Love Island\u0027s message, it seems to me, is conform and look beautiful otherwise you are not worthy of being loved.Kim Kardashian is the \u0027most dangerous\u0027 celebrity to search...Share this article \u0027Which is unbelievably dangerous. And that is what our teens are picking up, of course, when they watch that, but also every time they go online.\u0027It is a real vicious circle, I think, in that regard.\u0027          Mrs Lunnon says Love Island\u0027s message is to conform to look beautiful which can lead to a viscous circleMrs Lunnon questioned whether girls could be taken seriously when it comes to issues like the #MeToo campaign, while also succumbing to \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture which obsesses over appearance.She said: \u0027We might have to decide which camp we are in - I think we might have to ask our girls and our boys, actually, which camp are we in?\u0027She added she had concerns that young people were not taking themselves seriously by glorifying things that are trivial and insignificant. \u0027If we want to be taken seriously - the Me Too debate, hear us, we have agency, we have a voice - can we also be saying this trivial nonsense matters?\u0027    Mrs Lunnon said shows like Love Island point to the \u0027voyeuristic tendencies of our society\u0027HMC chairman Shaun Fenton said: \u0027I think young people can make choices about their diet of media and discern triviality from real news - fake news from real news.\u0027But if you overdose on a bad diet, if that is all you are presented with all the time, it is not in their interests.\u0027It is not in any of our interests to live in a society where we put on a pedestal the type of trivia that isn\u0027t what we aspire to for our children, that isn\u0027t what we think in our better moments we aspire to for ourselves.          Love Island was described as \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture which obsesses over image by Mrs Lunnon\u0027So there is nothing wrong with a bit of light-hearted entertainment at all.\u0027Mrs Lunnon explained that one way to tackle the effect of reality TV and social media would be for schools to remind students they belong to a community.She added that in recent years she had witnessed pupils become increasing engaged in political debate, something she found promising.\u0027It is youthquake rather than snowflake, I think. I think we should stop telling kids that they are insignificant and fragile and vulnerable.\u0027The snowflake thing is not helpful. They could change things, and if we get them to take themselves seriously and take the world seriously, they will,\u0027 said Mrs Lunnon.Veteran broadcaster Michael Buerk, who also spoke at the conference, said the age of social media and reality TV shows had seen public discourse become increasingly shallow.\u0027They are about us looking at ourselves, albeit in the mirror of other people’s lives, not interrogating the outside world.\u0027And they are making us ignorant, stupid and unhappy. And they are phenomenally successful.

A lot in Lathrop, California is pictured here          One customer demanded to know where her new Tesla was. The frustration only grew after she saw  hundreds of them parked up in a lot in Salt, Lake City, Utah          Elon Musk tweeted that there were problems with delivering cars to customers following this angry Tweet from a customerThe company announced Tuesday that it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter, marking a 50 percent increase over the previous quarter and when the company hit its target for the first time in the last week of June, some questioned whether the feat was sustainable.But it appears that there are other problems facing the company. Since July, Tesla has been parking anywhere from a couple of dozen to a few hundred cars at a lot in Burbank, California. It\u0027s a similar story in the town of Lathrop near San Francisco where Tesla has 400 cars at an industrial site according to the New York Times.Hundreds more have been located in in Antioch, northeast of San Fran. Last week, the newspaper reported that another batch of 100 Model 3s cars  in Bellevue, Washington with further batches in Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.Delta aircraft is evacuated after aborting its takeoff at...Who toppled the statue? Mystery in Philadelphia after...Share this article    The company has refused to comment on the reason for the surplus other than to say there were delivery problems at one stage          Some have suggested the full lots are because demand for Teslas isn\u0027t a great as the company advertises          Internet sleuths have taken to sending up drones and even flown in private planes to snap pictures of the parking lots containing dozens of the parked-up TeslasThe vehicles, which have all been parked on private property, have been uncovered by amateur detectives many of whom have flown drones over the parking lots to take pictures of the sitting cars.Another ended up taking to the skies in a private plane to snap hi-res photos from the air before posting them on Twitter. The sleuths are betting that Tesla\u0027s share price will fall and suggest Elon Musk has not been truthful about the company\u0027s current situation, particularly its sales numbers.The existence of such massive lots full of cars are likely proof that something is amiss at the company. A Tesla spokesman, Dave Arnold, said by email to the Times that the large lots of vehicles were \u0027logistics transit hubs\u0027 and added, \u0027Anyone observing those lots will see a change from one day to the next.\u0027           One photographer took to the skies in order to capture the cast numbers of cars sitting idle           Tesla Inc. vehicles sit in a parking lot outside of a newly constructed production tent at the company\u0027s manufacturing facility in Fremont, California           Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year - but then why are so many of the cars going nowhere? Production increases are something Musk worked nearly to exhaustion to achieve. He has publicly said he has been working as much as 120 hours per week and sometimes even slept on Tesla\u0027s factory floor in Fremont, California, to oversee the efforts to make more cars. The company even built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s.But doubts remain whether the company can continue to crank out enough vehicles to achieve profitability, something that still eludes Tesla.Although it successfully reached its production goals for the third quarter, getting those vehicles into the hands of consumers has proven to be a headache.Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year.But one other theory is that the presence of parking lots with hundreds of Teslas all parked up with no place to go, could mean that there is a delivery problem.          At one point, Elon Musk suggested that there was a shortage with hauliers transporting cars  CEO Elon Musk has pledged to work out the manufacturing problems that have raised questions about the electric car maker\u0027s future prospectsCustomers have been complaining that their Tesla delivery dates have been delayed over and over while vehicles sit unmoved in lots. One tweeted to Musk last month: \u0027There are 42 Tesla\u0027s sitting at the Union Pacific Railroad in SLC. My car is one of these. I\u0027ve been told I was getting delivery the 8th, then the 15th, then the 20th, then the 22nd, and now my delivery has been delayed indefinite. @Tesla @elonmusk... Please make this right.\u0027Musk tweeted back and acknowledged the problem: \u0027Sorry, we\u0027ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We\u0027re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly.\u0027Musk attributed the problem to a shortage of trucks to haul cars around the country but others disagree saying there is \u0027plenty of car haulage capacity.\u0027  \u0027The Auto Haulers Association of America is not aware of any shortage of car haulers, nor of any other automakers that are having trouble shipping new vehicles,\u0027 said  Guy Young from the organization.Musk has even said that Tesla has developed its own trailers to transport cars to customers but no new designs have been approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates such transporters.          The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Thousands are sitting in lots around the country          Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot featureEither way, it is clear that Tesla appears to have failed to set up an efficient way of delivering the hundreds of cars a day it is producing.The only other alternative is that demand is far less than Tesla is suggesting and the reason there are so many lots full of the costly cars is because there are simply no buyers.     Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance feature.More could be revealed in the coming days when Tesla reports production and delivery data for the last three months.But patience is wearing thin for people who have already put down $1,000 to get on a waiting list for the Model 3.Tesla has never turned an annual profit during its eight-year history and rarely done it on a quarterly basis, but it needs to reverse that trend to erase doubts about its survival.The company has been under mounting pressure to stop burning through cash with $1.3 billion of its more than $10 billion in debt due to be repaid during the next six months.Musk will give up his post as Tesla\u0027s chairman for at least three years after tweeting in August tweet that he would take the company private and had \u0027funding secured\u0027 for the deal.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Thursday that said the tweet constituted securities fraud because Musk knew he hadn\u0027t lined up the money for such a deal.Critics, including some investors, had pushed for similar changes recently, arguing that a new chairman and a board less tied to Musk would be good for Tesla and its investors. Some have argued Musk should even give up the CEO role and assume a post such as chief technical officer.The SEC said it wanted to bar Musk from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company, a scary option for investors who felt Musk was nearly synonymous with Tesla and that another executive would have trouble managing Tesla\u0027s manufacturing challenges and keeping the public satisfied in spite of Tesla\u0027s substantial debts.Unraveling a Tesla Mystery: Lots (and Lots) of Parked Cars - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/18/50EDE65100000578-0-image-m-30_1538501234483.jpg","title":"A day life Gisele Coconut oil sun gazing aromatherapy foot massages kids","story":"    Gisele Bundchen, 38, the supermodel wife of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, has just published new book Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life - which details her daily routine, workout regime, diet and meditation schedule          She and Brady are parents to son Benny, 8, and daughter Vivi, 5, as well as the athlete\u0027s older son, Jack, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan          Gisele writes her day starts between 5am and 6am, when she rises to \u0027ocean\u0027 sounds on her phone she then spends up to 15 minutes swilling coconut oil in her mouth in a process known as \u0027pulling\u0027     Gisele, a native of Brazil, married Brady in 2009 the model writes: \u0027It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive\u0027          Gisele, pictured in the web television series Tom vs Time, lives outside of Boston with Brady and their family, in addition to enjoying a property in Montana\u0027s exclusive Yellowstone Club - which featured heavily in the program          Gisele says her children perform daily chores, and she emphasizes cleaning she likes to leave \u0027rooms as tidy as I found them\u0027          Gisele writes in the book that she enjoys taking her children to school herself each night, she gives \u0027them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy.

To live a full and meaningful life with the awareness of what’s happening around me – and to inspire my children to live that way, too.‘Bedtime is another ritual. When Tom his home, he kisses the kids good night and sometimes he tells them a story. At bedtime, I love reading out loud to each child. Then I do something I ‘ve done since Benny and Vivi were infants: I give them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy. Five minutes of foot rubbing really calms them down, and makes us feel close.‘The last thing I do before saying good night is to remind them to pray to their guardian angel. I often wait outside their rooms, listening to them saying their prayers, and it melts my heart every time.’Tom usually goes to bed by 9pm, she writes, whereas she can stay up as late as 10, though she showers before going to bed ‘especially if they used lots of product and my hair looks crazy.’ (It’s not exactly clear who ‘they’ are.’‘I need at least seven hours of sleep, eight if I can get it,’ she writes. ‘Thankfully I’ve never had any trouble falling asleep.

The left hands reveal their private sides.’Can this be true? We asked Helen to read these royal palms without knowing who they belonged to. The results were uncannily accurate...    The lines on the right hand represent the side the royals want to show the public. The left hands reveal their private sides, palm expert reveals 1. A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION          A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION: Feminine with long, willowy fingersThese hands are very feminine. From the long, willowy fingers, it’s clear these are the hands of a sensitive, artistic person. This is the most interesting royal palm thanks to a very unusual feature on the right hand, known as a Simian Line.Usually the Head Line and Heart Line are separate and spaced apart as they run into the centre of the palm. However, on this royal, it shows up as only one line which ides the hand in half horizontally.This special feature is known as a ‘gift marker’ —and reveals a person of enormous drive, energy and focus. Add this to the long, straight Heart Line on their left hand, it reveals a considerate person likely to be a humanitarian.This person will also need a mission which they can pour their energy into to be happy. This is not a royal who will want to hide behind the scenes, more someone who will take to the world stage and make a positive impact.Also, the equal length of ring and index fingers mean they really understand feelings which will also make them a good parent.2. CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD            CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD: Thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature sideThe thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature side, or perhaps a passion for food. The ruddy colour and bloated appearance of the hands also suggest this is a person who needs to pay more attention to their health. The Life Line is short too, suggesting low energy.The length of the fingers also show this is a royal who loves to talk.The slightly longer ring finger suggests they love a bit of appreciation and applause — if they weren’t a royal they could have been a celebrity food critic!Other markers show this royal may feel conflicted by the expectations of being a member of the Royal Family.For example, the Life Line and Head Line start and stay together for about an inch, so this person is comfortable following the traditions they’ve grown up with. However, this conflicts with the shortish middle finger, which suggests a desire to rebel or break ‘the rules’.That could mean this member of ‘The Firm’ is not sure how to get his needs met and still fit in with the expectations of his position.  3. THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE            THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE: Slightly longer ring fingers emphasis someone who can be quite analyticalThis royal has the fingers and palm of a thinker, someone who can be quite analytical, emphasised by her slightly longer ring fingers.This means she is probably quite visual and her appearance may be quite important. It also means this is someone who thrives on appreciation and applause!This royal holds their little finger off to the side, suggesting a highly private person who prefers not to expose their vulnerabilities.Both thumbs are held close to her palm, suggesting again they like to play their cards close to their chest.All in all, a strong inidual capable of restraint in pursuit of what she believes in.4. FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION          FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION: Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional valuesThe three lines, crossed by three others, at the bottom of this royal’s index finger, shows this is someone with very high standards.Like many royal palms, the Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional values. However, the short distance between the height of this person’s middle fingers and their index and ring fingers, shows they have a rebellious streak. This is likely to have shown up more in their youth.There are also four short parallel lines under the joint between the ring and little fingers. This is ‘the gifted healer’. It can mean someone who is inspirational in helping others.It’s possible this royal will have expressed this through charity work. 5. A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE          A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE: Area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plumpThe area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plump.This shows a person who likes to have fun and may have been a bit of a hedonist in their youth. This royal’s Heart Line is curvy, showing that they are naturally passionate.However, as the line straightens out towards the end, it suggests this person curbs their passionate nature, possibly out of duty.In both hands, the index, or pointer-finger, looks the strongest and has more of a ‘platform’ or fleshy pad. This suggests someone who has put a lot of energy into being in charge, carving out their turf and leading the way in what matters to them.As these qualities also show up on the left hand, this royal will be no walkover at home either — and that will help make them a good parent and partner. 6. CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE          CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE: Middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebelThe middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebel.This person also has a light, horizontal line joining the Head and Heart line. This means it’s hard for them to decide whether to go with their heart or logic. A slightly upward curving Heart Line shows a caring character who tries to do the right thing, even if their inner rebel sometimes gets them into trouble.The way their vertical Fate Line — also known as a Saturn Line — underneath the middle finger stops at the Head Line shows this side probably kicks in when they get bored.The little finger is long, suggesting this is a person who probably loves to talk.The ring at the base of their little finger, covering the bottom segment — the intimacy zone — also shows this person wants to protect themselves from being hurt emotionally.7. A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE          A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE: A square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done’ This royal has a square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done.’His Head Line is the straightest and least curved of them all, revealing this is the most logical person in the family.There is also a Fate Line which goes up vertically through his palm towards his middle finger.This shows someone who is a doer who follows through.This royal’s Head Line is long and straight and stretches into his zone of intuition — the plumper area down the side of your palm opposite the thumb.Our hands can change over time.If this line keeps developing, it will mean this royal is going to start combining logic with intuition.This will help them see things from many different perspectives.The long little fingers show this person is a really strong communicator, while the thick, strong index fingers show he will also be very persuasive.Whoever this person is, they are going to be great asset to the Royal Family.8. ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS          ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS: Complex, masculine hands, full of contradictionsThese are complex, masculine hands, full of contradictions.They look like the stubby-fingered hands of a traditional ‘builder’, solid, rough and earthy.The Life Line is deeply etched and long, showing this person has lots of energy.There is also a well-developed ‘intimacy area’ in the bottom segment of the little finger.This is someone who can share deeply with others. There are criss-crosses too in this person’s Moon Zone, at the base of the palm opposite the thumb.What this means is it’s someone who has tried lots of different mystical things.However, looking at the really short middle segment of the little fingers, this is also a person who doesn’t do negotiation.The approach is: ‘It’s my way or the highway.’9. STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGY             STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGYThis is a strong powerful palm of an older royal in the shape of a long rectangle, a sign of a person who thinks things through.There is also a strong Fate Line that stretches up vertically through their hand, showing this is someone who finishes what they start.These are also balanced hands with strong, straight fingers, which is a sign of an ethical person with a sense of self who is comfortable with their personal power.The slightly longer index finger shows they like to be in charge.They have a passionate Heart Line on both hands. So they will prioritise what they believe is important over and above other people’s feelings and needs.Their Life Line is deep and long showing they have extraordinary energy reserves.The combination of all these factors suggests a person with a clear sense of their own place in the world, something that may have served this royal well over their lifetime. 10. A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE          A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVEOn this palm, the Fate Line stops at the Heart Line.We call this The Grand Gesture — and it’s a sign of someone who will give up everything for love.However, unlike most of the other royals, the Head and Life Lines are not tied together at the start.This shows this is someone who likes to make up their own mind.Also, unlike many of the other royal hands, there isn’t a ‘platform’ where the index finger meets the palm, which is often a sign of someone who likes being in charge.However, there is a ‘platform’ underneath the ring finger on the left palm, which is her private side.This shows this royal is happiest being the boss at home, while others — perhaps a partner — take the limelight in public.AND THE ANSWERS ARE...           "},{"url":null,"title":"What catch Incredible moment retired bear grabs slice bread MOUTH","story":"    The footage, filmed from the inside of a car, captured the \u0027retired show bear\u0027 as it sat on the grass inside a fenced areaThe passenger then threw a piece of sliced bread from the car like a frisbee, the bear ducking its head as it approached.But just as it seemed like the bread was destined for the floor, the creature quickly snapped its jaw - swallowing the snack in one bite.Throw me a bone!

Tried it the other way round, this is better.”On being a father:“I’ve been really pleasantly surprised by the whole thing. I thought, ‘I can’t afford kids, I haven’t got the time,’ but I’ve been amazed by how easy it is and how little they cost. If I’d known, I might have done it sooner I would have been living in a shoe surrounded by children.”On retiring:“Poetry is not something you have to retire from. There is no heavy lifting involved. I have no intention of ever quitting.”On performing poetry:“I started reading about Byron and other poets, and how they did public readings, or as we would say now, gigs. It made a lot of sense to me. So I thought, why not bring it up to date, and drag it into the world of show business?”On swearing:“Where would I be without swearing? I’ve made a living out of dirty language. Nobody swears more than me in a poem. It’s worked to my advantage. I knew that when I wrote it, and it paid off. I was right. Finger on the pulse, right from the start.”On opening for punk bands:“They were a picnic compared to the working men’s clubs.

The IPO marks a remarkable turnaround for a business that has gone bust seven times since it was founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in a small London workshop in 1913.Jasper Lawler, analyst at London Capital Group, said it was the most hotly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of the year.“The first public listing of a British carmaker in decades has the kind of ‘dinner party’ appeal that few IPOs share. We think the iconic status of this century-old British motoring brand, coupled with its relative insulation against Brexit or trade tensions, make this listing a compelling proposition.”The company is hoping its stock-market listing will allow it to invest in greater production volumes and new products.Aston Martin is now one of the world’s biggest sports car brands. Palmer has overhauled the business by revamping the product lineup and returning it to profit after years of losses.The company has said that it has given detailed consideration to what impact Britain’s departure from the EU might have on business, but does not believe it would pose a major threat, largely because it is a global firm selling into a range of markets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00f7a165a22d411e950fb9a4da0ba285c272a90/15_257_2113_1267/master/2113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4b47a19ab94eaa60aa3358154a7572","title":"noel edmonds lloyds bank ads hbos reading","story":"Former Deal or No Deal host in dispute over bank’s handling of HBOS fraud scandalNoel Edmonds has failed in a bid to get Lloyds Bank’s black horse TV ads banned, as the TV presenter’s £60m legal battle with the banking group becomes increasingly acrimonious.The former Deal or No Deal presenter’s claim stems from a historic fraud scandal at the bank’s HBOS Reading arm, which affected 60 small business owners, relating to losses from the collapse of his entertainment firm Unique Group a decade ago, as well as the distress and humiliation he says he has suffered.Keystone Law, representing Edmonds and other victims of the fraud, lodged a complaint with the advertising regulator against the bank’s TV campaign featuring its famous black horse.The ad campaign features a black horse running past a memorial service, a neighbourhood with a mother caring for her baby and on a beach with children.

Now, pedestrian walkways are being reimagined for a 21st-century cityOn Pudding Lane in the City of London, the fateful alleyway where the Great Fire began in 1666, an unprepossessing staircase leads off the cobbled street. There doesn’t seem to be much reason to climb the steps, tucked away behind a row of granite columns at the base of a dumpy office block, but inquisitive walkers will be rewarded. Those who follow the stairs find themselves led along a walkway, shuttled across a bridge above a busy dual carriageway, channelled through a gloomy undercroft, finally emerging on to a deserted piazza raised above the Thames, with one of the most unexpected prospects in London: a wide-open river view. The Shard stands straight ahead, Tower Bridge rises to the east and the new tower of the South Bank sparkles to the west.This forgotten terrace, miraculously left uncolonised by a riverside dining concept, is a fragment of a larger vision that would have seen the entire City area threaded with a network of elevated walkways, punctuated by such squares in the sky. The “pedway” was an ambitious postwar plan to whisk pedestrians up from the car-choked streets of London and give them a utopia of streamlined paths and bridges, providing safe and efficient passage between the financial hubs of the Square Mile.The network was intended to stretch for 30 miles, from Fleet Street to the Tower of London, and from Liverpool Street to the Thames, but only a fraction was built, much of which has since been demolished. A few fragments remain, from plaintive bridge abutments still waiting for their connection to arrive, to winding staircases that lead to dead-end landings, scattered across the City like curious portals to a secret dimension.Just when the last remains appeared to be facing extinction, these floating walkways are showing signs of a revival. The London Wall Place project includes a new network of flying decks and serpentine walkways that thread their way around ancient chunks of the Roman city wall. Together with 21 Moorfields – the shopping mall at the new Crossrail station at Moorgate – they herald the beginning of an elevated journey where you will be able to go from Moorgate to the Museum of London without touching the ground.The parallel pedestrian universe was first hinted at by architects William Holford and Charles Holden, who drew up a plan for rebuilding London’s financial centre in 1947, after it had been devastated by bombing during the second world war. “There is, of course, even a functional pattern in the ant-heap,” they wrote, describing the jumbled network of alleyways and spaces that defined the medieval street network of the City. “The planner’s problem is to make this pattern more efficient.” Their plan contained a bold chapter on pedestrian ways that were to be “as fit for the traffic it carries as any of the main streets”, an idea that would inform the redevelopment of the City for the next three decades.The urge to separate pedestrians from traffic was nothing new: the construction of Holborn Viaduct, Rosebery Avenue and Clerkenwell Road in the 19th century were all attempts to sweep people up above the noise and grime down below. But the rapid growth of car ownership in the 1950s and 60s spawned increasing anxiety around congestion and collision, leading to the widely accepted belief that people and cars should be segregated for the benefit of both. The influential book Traffic in Towns, published by planner Colin Buchanan in 1964, set the mould for the hostile apparatus of flyovers, gyratories and ring roads that would proliferate across British cities for the rest of the 20th century.“It was because traffic engineers were in charge,” says Peter Rees, chief planner of the City of London from 1985 to 2014, now a professor at University College London, explaining the origins of the pedway. “It wasn’t driven by some great feeling of compassion towards pedestrians it was simply about getting people out of the way in order to speed up traffic flow.” With the new dual carriageways of London Wall and Lower Thames Street slicing right through the centre of the capital, pedestrians were lifted up on bridges so they wouldn’t slow down the cars.The doctrine of vertical separation informed the reconstruction plans for the major bomb sites of the Barbican and Paternoster Square, both designed with towers emerging from podiums, threaded with pedestrian walkways. The former remains a thrilling (if labyrinthine) brutalist Babylon of bush-hammered concrete bridges over bodies of water, christened with names such as Speed Highwalk. The latter was a bleak, barren expanse of elevated paving between dreary office blocks and, thankfully, no longer exists.Apart from these projects, the rest of the pedway plan was developed almost by stealth. An obscure City of London Corporation document published in 1965, mysteriously known as Drawing 3400B, mentioned the pedway by name for the first time and, within a couple of years, the provision of dedicated pedestrian walkways had become cemented in policy as a condition for securing planning consent.In a revealing documentary, Elevating London, Michael Hebbert, professor of planning at UCL, sheds light on the haphazard nature of the pedway’s evolution. “It was never really conceived as a system,” he says. “They didn’t even have a drawing of the network as a whole. It had to be constructed from the separate planning consents for inidual office blocks.” It was a British version of a postwar planning strategy that would eschew a top-down vision for an incremental network that would be negotiated on an ad hoc, site-by-site basis – and thus almost doomed to fail from the beginning.The piecemeal plan was to be lubricated by incentives. Developers were offered plot ratio concessions, allowing them to squeeze more rentable office area out of their sites, and permitted to use their pedway-connection platforms for temporary offices, giving them extra revenue while they waited to be joined to their neighbour – connections that would usually never arrive. Walking the streets of the City today, you can still make out chunks of unconsummated pedway at first-floor level that have remained glazed in ever since. Other sections have been spruced up: at Suffolk Lane, just east of Cannon Street station, a pedway ramp begins inside a grand neoclassical colonnade before emerging on to a bridge, recently clad in smart timber slats. A forlorn concrete bridge over Wormwood Street, meanwhile, has just been adorned with a traditional Korean house, impaled at an angle as if fallen from the skies, by artist Do Ho Suh. Redundant for their original purpose, these aerial fingers are becoming armatures for other inventive happenings.Beyond the lack of a joined-up masterplan, there were plenty of other obstacles to the pedway’s progression. Development didn’t proceed quite as quickly as had been imagined, while the fire brigade struggled to find equipment suitable for the walkways and the police were unsure of their legal powers on these new-fangled floating arteries. All the while, bills for maintenance, cleaning and lighting soared. But the main problem was that people didn’t use them. As Rees explains: “In as far as people carry mental maps to get around, those maps are based on streets. The minute you displace that map by taking people up on to walkways, their mental map function breaks down and they get lost.”The effort of going up a flight of stairs only to come down another also proved less attractive to many than the prospect of gingerly picking their way along the kerb of a dual carriageway. The growing conservation movement put up a strong fight, too. Looking at the 1963 map, it is not hard to see why, given that sections of pedways appear to slice right through St Paul’s Cathedral.With the Big Bang of the 1980s, which brought about deregulation, banks started to acquire larger sites to accommodate their dealing floors, making it harder to thread pedestrians through the buildings at first-floor level. A belated attempt to lure people up to the existing walkways with pubs, shops and kiosks came too late. Architect Terry Farrell’s Alban Gate, a gargantuan postmodern palace that straddled London Wall and was completed in 1992, was one of the few projects of the era that embraced the pedway, welcoming people with a theatrical drawbridge entrance, but few others followed suit, leaving the Barbican and Museum of London sites as quaint anomalies.So it comes as a surprise to walk along London Wall today and find a rusted orange steel bridge flung above the carriageway. This is London Wall Place, one of the most agile projects to emerge from Make Architects, which has reimagined the pedway as a more playful and generous version of the original, with decks wide enough to incorporate benches on which you might want to sit awhile, beside green walls and reflecting pools.It will soon be joined a little way to the north by Wilkinson Eyre’s 21 Moorfields project, the commercial bounty of Moorgate station’s Crossrail redevelopment, a 564,000 sq ft glass and steel behemoth that will be connected to the Barbican at first-floor level by a modern interpretation of the highwalk, welcoming you in to the inevitable podium of retail and dining opportunities. Like London Wall Place, it will be a hulking beast, but, as you are led through the sequence of walkways in a suspended realm between street and slab, you probably won’t even notice.The elevated network will end at the Museum of London site, where the new £250m Centre for Music is planned. The concert hall’s design is appropriately in the hands of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, architects of New York’s High Line, who have a penchant for aerial drama.The ultimate City-wide plan will never be realised, but, more than 50 years from its conception, these segments of pedway are being reincarnated in a more imaginative form than ever.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1cba5014a8604dc4672db98c529c6d7bc62245/40_0_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f485cc88f40227c45be838dab0223312","title":"tory conference government brexit","story":"What have we, the people of Britain, done to the Conservative party? Why do they hate us so much? As the odours from their annual feasting in Birmingham drift over the airwaves, I find my responses metastasising beyond the merely political and into the realms of the psychological.I get the sense that they’re punishing us, somehow. That there’s some deep-seated Jungian weirdness being acted out on the British public, every time the zealot Daniel Hannan vows to feed us his chlorinated chicken, every time Jeremy Hunt threatens us with his leadership credentials. It’s as if we (Britain) are the child. And they (the Tories) are the dysfunctional parents, ripping themselves apart, occasionally grabbing us by the wrists to prove some sort of point to the other.Theresa May comes up for air. She would like it to be known that she hopes to end freedom of movement within the European Union. She will remove – just like that! – our right to work in France or retire in Spain as that, she has decided, is what we want. She seems weirdly proud about it, too, a little bit “Look what you made me do.” But no member of the British public asked for this. No one made her do it other than the peculiar tribe to which she has pledged allegiance.There’s something similarly demented about Boris Johnson’s ambitions too. You don’t want this reckless narcissist in charge of the country. No one wants that. Aside from perhaps, a certain portion of the 120,000-odd people who are still perverse enough to be members of the Tory party – because it’s his turn. And somehow, by some convoluted ancestral logic, this is the wing who must be appeased, these are the appetites that must be indulged, these are the people who might actually decide.England, as George Orwell once wrote, is a family with the wrong members in control. There are the rich relations who must be sucked up to, the poor relations who must be spat upon, and it’s best not to ask too many questions about where all the wealth came from. And remember: “It is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts.” Just as adult family squabbles bring with them that same sense of “Why am I still dealing with this shit?”, so it is here: the patrician fossils aren’t talking to the reckless Atlanticists, and the oleaginous metropolitan wing is at odds with the racist granddads – and Cousin Jacob must have his special plate. Stop being the difficult one!Toxic introspection is not confined to the Tories. There is a certain species of Labourite who believes their own internal squabbles are of paramount interest to Labour voters too. But at least this tendency of the left was counterbalanced by a set of coherent ideas emerging from the Labour conference, a vision for the sort of country we might like to become. There is none of that emerging from Birmingham – no policies, no direction from our bedridden aunt of a prime minister.The reason all this feels more personal than political is that Tory dysfunction has already infected our lives. No one outside the Tory membership much cared much about the European Union prior to David Cameron calling a referendum. The 2016 vote was intended as a way of resolving the Tory family squabble. All it has done is impose it on the nation as a whole their problem is now our problem.And perhaps the most insidious effect is the way that Brexit has entered actual families too, setting children against parents, sibling against sibling, such that the word “Brexit” conjures something beyond mere trade deals and treaties. It has poisoned relationships, distanced generations, infected homes. For a party that is supposed to stand up for family values, that will be quite a legacy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b1b1fd30be5a53f66d4728c39542166f0f4ef6a/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b272fa02b909a6080dd86fcc68ee5e9","title":"grenfell families inquiry buildings combustible ban","story":"Almost 16 months after the fire at Grenfell Tower that killed 72 people, bereaved families and survivors on Monday secured an important first step toward making homes safer across the country. The ban on combustible materials will bring the rest of the UK into line with Scotland and the EU, allowing only A1 or A2 “limited combustibility” materials on the external walls of residential buildings 18 metres or more tall.The move has been greeted with a guarded welcome from families, who are waiting for more detail. There is little doubt that their campaign has brought about the change. Earlier in the year, the government was set to approve the use of desktop studies to clear materials used on high-rise buildings. The consultation on combustibles was announced the same day as a public outcry over the Hackitt review, which reported back in May. The Grenfell Tower inquiry is yet to make any interim recommendations, and does not yet appear to have appointed a cladding expert.How government implements this ban, particularly around the use of desktop studies and exemptions, will be important. For some, it may not go far enough. This is an industry that demonstrably cannot self-regulate when it comes to safety. Even now, contractors at the inquiry have been criticised for being disingenuous. Anyone who has watched videos of the speed and spread of the fire across the north-east face of Grenfell Tower will understand why this ban is important. Between 12.56am and 1.20am on 14 June 2017, fire zipped up the side of Grenfell Tower. It then moved horizontally through a “crown” of combustible material. It spread downwards and diagonally across the building and back inside through open windows. Jets were trained on the external fire, but they “bounced off”. One firefighter described the flames as spitting “like magnesium”. This was a fire of petroleum-based, highly flammable products, combustible at a low temperature, piled one on top of another in the damp-proof course, the cavity infill, the insulation, the windows, and the cladding cassettes.Yesterday, the inquiry wrapped up evidence from the London fire brigade (LFB) before moving to hear testimony from the bereaved and survivors. This morning, they heard that the LFB’s operational database contained no plan of Grenfell Tower to aid firefighting tactics. Last week, they were met by a surprising display of institutional defensiveness from Dany Cotton, the LFB commissioner. Families listened in shock as Cotton told the inquiry she had no knowledge of serious international cladding fires before Grenfell. The LFB did not plan for a fire the size of Grenfell, or devise training for staff based on that possibility, she said, “in the same way as I would never design a training package for a space shuttle to land on the Shard”.Shown evidence of warnings – an internal presentation for fire brigade engineers on the threat from “tall building facades” dated July 2016 a letter from the LFB to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) warning them of the risks from external facades after the Shepherd’s Court fire – Cotton accepted that the risk was on LFB’s radar nine months before the fire at Grenfell Tower. “I truly do not think it would have benefited anyone to have more detailed knowledge about cladding to respond to Grenfell, because it wouldn’t have enabled them to extinguish the fire,” she said.“To hear Dany Cotton say that she would not have done anything differently is heartbreaking and feels disrespectful to 72 people who lost their lives,” said Natasha Elcock of Grenfell United. “There were warnings from many previous high-rise fires with cladding on them. The risks should have been taken seriously. To not prepare for a repeat of Lakanal House and say chances are like a space ship on the Shard is flippant and disrespectful. If anything, her answers suggest a culture of complacency and focus on damage limitation.”The fire brigade did not wrap the building in combustible material. Firefighters will live with that night for the rest of their lives, and many are deeply traumatized. Over the past three months, the inquiry has repeatedly heard how firefighters risked their own lives to save others. It has heard of the building failures the cladding the unprecedented nature of the fire but also of communications systems that did not work failed rescue attempts slips of paper carried by runners residents saved by the quick thinking of officers who provided additional breathing sets (not in LFB policy) residents moved by firefighters from one flat to another and told that someone would come for them. It has heard that firefighters were not trained on cladding fires or evacuations, or on the reversal of stay put. It has heard of one officer, Norman Harrison, who told his bosses that stay put should be reversed, but was ignored.In his report, The Patronising Disposition of Unaccountable Power, the Right Rev James Jones makes important points about the treatment of the bereaved after a public tragedy. He speaks of a “culture of denial” in public authorities, the need for candour, and a willingness to accept criticism and learn from errors. These are all lessons from Hillsborough. Cotton’s defensiveness set a disturbing precedent for other public bodies and core participants yet to be called. It signals that survivors and families may have yet another battle on their hands – the battle for truth and accountability.“For this inquiry to have meaning,” said Deborah Coles , the director of Inquest, “it must establish the truth and perform its vital preventative role so that such needless loss of life is never repeated. To achieve this, all witnesses must be open, honest and candid. There must also be a willingness to acknowledge and learn from failings. Only through this can there be effective and meaningful change and the lives of those who died properly respected.”Truth, accountability and change. These are the elements of justice. As survivors prepare to give evidence on Wednesday, they know they have a long road ahead of them. While families campaign for change outside the inquiry, inside they face a similar battle. There have been legal wrangles over disclosure, a dry technical process that has alienated many families and diminished the goodwill created in the opening commemorations. The venue is inappropriate it’s nowhere near the local community and impossible for those juggling work with the school run, which means many do not feel able to participate fully. For some, the inquiry venue is also where they heard bad news. The authorities should note Jones’s points of learning on the need for effective participation and the treatment of the bereaved after a public tragedy. This is their inquiry. Their voices must be heard.The inquiry, and the police investigation, could lead to change, but the wheels of justice are slow and their destination is uncertain. For now, the real change seems to be taking place outside the inquiry processes, led by the families themselves, who are determined to ensure that their children are not still campaigning for change in 30 years’ time. They should not have to fight. On Monday, they made this country safer and showed that their voices will be heard. The government seems to be listening. The inquiry – and those in public office called to give evidence – must listen too.As Elcock said: “We want Grenfell to be remembered not just for the trauma we went through but for the change that comes next. We hope this is the start of that change.”• Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher and a former neighbourhood officer at Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e653e365a4b8b1ae0f2bade1c7a5c30903b10062/0_56_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd6cb55c9e2e0b912032692bdf009ab","title":"pan european picnic 1989 communism populism","story":"A ‘pan-European picnic’ helped defeat communism. This time the enemy is populismOn 19 August 1989, just outside the small Hungarian city of Sopron, in a meadow only metres from the barbed wire and armed guards at the border with Austria, civil society representatives from east and west held a “pan-European picnic”, a day in the country that aimed to put an end, through small symbolic steps, to cold war ision. In a small though surprising gesture of openness, this “déjeuner sur l’herbe” was authorised by the communist government. Nobody expected, however, that thousands of people, many of them East German citizens on holiday in their “brother nation”, would decide to join the gathering and head towards the line of demarcation, intent on peacefully breaking through the iron curtain.Heedless of all risk to their safety, they decided to cross the border on foot. Taken by surprise, the communist regime’s police didn’t fire a shot, giving rise to a popular movement that, a few months later, brought down the Berlin Wall. It marked the beginning of Europe’s reunification, brought to fruition in the following years with the construction of a common democratic space that would include (albeit controversially) a large number of countries that, after 1945, had been abandoned to Soviet oppression.Last August, as I made my way along the former iron curtain from Slovenia to Germany, passing through abandoned checkpoints. Portions of the wall were still intact, and old military posts testified to how quickly history can get out of hand, I thought of that picnic 29 years ago – how that simple gathering started a process that changed the course of history. I also thought of how today, as dark clouds gather once more above Europe, the time has come for all citizens of good will to mobilise. To gather as they did at Sopron in the summer of 1989, and resist any return to ision, xenophobia, exclusion, discrimination and barriers. In short, to prevent any return to a past of pain and oppression.Democracy itself and the European Union – the most formidable political construction in modern history – are today under attack. Donald Trump’s US and Vladimir Putin’s Russia are united in their intention to dismantle the political union, and work daily to that end, with the support of local extremist political parties. The time has come for sincere European democrats to react to this deadly threat. It is time to wake up and resist the extremist forces that mask their intentions under assurances that they do not want to resort to violence and the destruction of the constitutional and democratic equilibrium.In reality, however, wherever they have taken power, these forces call into question liberal principles and stigmatise minorities, the opposition and outsiders. They antagonise civil society organisations and dissident voices, reignite old ethno-nationalisms, fuel fake news and foment hatred in their constant search for scapegoats.Back in the 1930s, extremist parties systematically resorted to terror and violence. Now, in the early 21st century, they rely on disinformation, defamation and intimidation. But beware of underestimating the tragic endgame of these policies. Who would have imagined even a few years ago the demonisation of non-governmental organisations, the violent rejection and murder of refugees, the persecution of foreigners, the conspicuous increase in xenophobic acts or, as seen recently in the US, the separation, segregation and incarceration of children, guilty only of having tried to cross the border with Mexico? All this while dictatorship, illiberal democracy or bloody conflict run wild in nearly all the countries surrounding the European Union.Peaceful coexistence is under serious threat, as much as the European Union which embodies it.The crisis we face is no longer one of legitimacy and the evident dysfunctioning of Brussels, as illustrated by the recent migration challenge. It is the very existence of the postwar democratic and social pact that is, little by little, being called into question.Everywhere, democratic and progressive forces are distressed by the re-emergence of ghosts thought to be confined to the past. How to combat the tendencies and assertions of parties that exploit the confusion of populations faced with economic crisis, the disruption of globalisation and the loss of traditional reference points? A democratic uprising should inevitably begin with the convergence of forces, associations, groups and inidual citizens who were until now ided by misunderstandings, old grievances, different sensitivities.Now is the time for genuine democrats to find their feet, and unite against a common nemesis that could displace them and bury liberal democracy for good. We cannot remain unarmed against projects such as that planned by the far-right American Steve Bannon to build an international alliance of European sovereignists. As in August 1989, the time has come to call on citizens to organise, gather together, and change the course of history.“Where there is danger, there also rises that which saves,” wrote the poet Friedrich Hölderlin. All of us who are conscious of the dangers currently threatening Europe, Italy especially, and who feel we are facing a turning point in our lives and those of our children, cannot just wait for this threat to fade away. All those who believe that the old national reference points are not sufficient to address the new geopolitical, economic, social, migratory, technological, cultural and environmental challenges, who believe in a more united Europe, all those convinced that the United States of Europe is the only serious and concrete hope for the reaffirmation of the spirit of liberty, justice, solidarity and fraternity, should now make their voices, their cries, their determination, heard.On the pan-European picnic memorial erected after the events of 19 August 1989, an inscription serves as a reminder: “The coming era cannot be an era of blows and hostilities. This is the responsibility to which the future obliges us.”This is why a few months ago I founded EuropaNow!, a civil society organisation aimed at fostering a sense of European patriotism and promoting a United States of Europe. It is up to all democratic Europeans, especially the young people of the Erasmus generation, to show that they still hear the echo of liberty from Sopron, that they’re ready to take to their feet for a united and fraternal Europe.To that end, on 6 October, EuropaNow! will hold a pan-European picnic, in Ferrara, Italy, during the city’s annual festival, organised by the Italian weekly Internazionale.• Eric Jozsef is a French journalist based in Rome"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b54d72f524d87b0e5c7d1b0d8bd0ad539cae8ec/0_97_2641_1585/master/2641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97036a2292ef8119214d59c148d88bad","title":"tories conference vision brexit voters eu","story":"The party fixates on one issue, hitching its integrity and reputation for competence to a project that will bring ridiculeIf there is a better illustration of the need to be careful what you wish for than this week’s Conservative conference, I haven’t seen it. The Birmingham symphony hall is packed with people who campaigned for Brexit, are getting Brexit, and look most unhappy about it. In less than six months, the UK’s membership of the EU ends, yet the sect that should be quivering in anticipation of Eurosceptic rapture is glum in Brum.It would be wrong to say the Tories are panicking. They are at the brittle stage immediately before panic, just about holding it together. Ministers wear the taut stares of people who might burst into maniacal laughter or hysterical tears. The terms of EU withdrawal are due to be finalised within weeks and talks are at an impasse. There is not a deal available that can satisfy the whole of the Conservative party, avoid incinerating relations with our continental neighbours, and avert economic chaos.A popular game on the margins of the conference is guessing the number of irreconcilable Tory wreckers – the MPs who would launch the UK off the Brexit cliff without a legal safety net. The boasters say it is around 80. Their level-headed colleagues cut that estimate by up to a half. Some predict it could be whittled down to 20 once the grave implications of sabotaging a signed agreement are met at close quarters. Feasible consequences of Theresa May’s deal failing include parliament mandating a softer Brexit, a referendum leading to no Brexit at all, or some sequence of tumbling dominoes that propels Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street as prime minister. Mulling that menu, some ultra-Eurosceptics will fall into line.Even then, May cannot be sure of a majority, so it is wise to pencil in a political and constitutional crisis before Christmas. Meanwhile, the gravity of the moment works to the prime minister’s advantage. The ticking clock favours an incumbent, even when many Tories long for different leadership. The same backbench rabble-rousers who claim to have a whole battalion poised to overwhelm May’s Chequers deal admit there is not the equivalent will to initiate a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.It takes 48 letters from MPs to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee to trigger a ballot that she would probably win. It is a measure of the hardliners’ cowardice and cynicism that they do not want to replace their leader, but bully her into delivering Brexit on their terms. Then they can dispose of her (and blame her when nothing turns out as promised).This is bad news for Boris Johnson, as the most prominent alternative leader. His most recognisable trait is unseriousness, which is poorly matched to such serious times. Johnson has been loitering with intent to be leader for a bit too long. He is still a favourite of grassroots Tory members, able to pull an admiring crowd here in Birmingham, and it is rash ever to write him off. But he has amassed enemies among the MPs whose backing he would need to advance in a leadership race. There is a sense now of Conservatives sniffing at the product labelled “Boris”, as if investigating a carton of milk that has been open for a few days and might be on the turn.Johnson is smart enough to know this, which is why there is a certain desperation to his attention-grabbing antics. He is aware that Tory noses are twitching towards fresher candidacies. Among cabinet ministers, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab all gave speeches that were reviewed as early-stage auditions for the top job. The speculation also takes in Esther McVey, Liam Fox, Michael Gove … so many in fact that it is more efficient to name high-profile Conservatives who aren’t discussed as part of the post-May contenders’ parade.This proliferation of wannabe leaders does not reflect fecund Conservative thinking but the opposite. It looks like wild flailing around in the hope of alighting on a saviour. It presages the kind of ragged succession battle when medieval monarchs died heirless. The remnants of David Cameron’s modernising, liberal Toryism expired with the defeat of the remain campaign. Brexit then trampled all over May’s promises to lead a government of social reform, to douse “burning injustice”.Meanwhile, the party faces a trajectory of demographic decline. Strong indicators of “definitely not voting Conservative” are youth, university education, non-white background and living in rented accommodation. Many Tories know they need something to say to those growing audiences, but their intellectual bandwidth is hogged by the complexity of disentangling the UK from EU membership. And that is a policy that promises nothing to millions of people the Tories have to woo.The puritanical hunt for a clean break from Brussels, which turns inevitably to the hounding of pro-European “traitors”, aggravates suspicion that the party is more interested in flattering the resentments of its existing voters than befriending new ones.Conservatives crave better responses to Corbyn’s Labour party than the stale reds-under-the-bed denunciations rehearsed from the stage in Birmingham. But they struggle to imagine what such a message sounds like. They cannot see a clear political horizon because the view is blocked by Brexit.The Tories have hitched their integrity and their reputation for competence to a project that will deliver them to ridicule before it offers renewal. So they stick with May, not because they like her or trust her, but because someone has to finish the job she has started, and it might as well be her. None of the alternative candidates is fool enough to take on that errand now. So May’s torment continues, her thankless, pointless mission unchanged: to make Eurosceptic Tories unhappy by giving them the thing they always wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1218770aaafc387f65f28df37c970d6565e2e613/253_26_5084_3050/master/5084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f47d577dcbd76d05e2645994e02d8cf","title":"never return teach england refuge abroad","story":"An estimated 15,000 teachers are snapped up overseas each year, driven away by the stress in British schoolsThe English education system is broken, says Freya Odell, a state secondary school teacher with 18 years’ experience. This month, she followed in the footsteps of thousands of other talented, fed-up teachers and moved abroad – in her case, to St George’s British International School in Rome.“It wasn’t a difficult decision. My job in England took over my life. Over the past year, I had stopped laughing and smiling. I had lost all sense of who I am.”Despite being director of learning, literacy lead and director of English at her previous school, Odell, 38, had to teach 20 out of 30 lessons and mentor three new staff. “I had to get up at 4.30am to get everything done, returning home at 7pm and working for another hour before bed, as well as at weekends.” She offered to take a pay cut to reduce her teaching load, but was refused.In Italy, she has been allocated the same amount of teaching but none of the responsibilities – and she will teach a class of 16 children, instead of 34. “If St George’s will have me for ever, I will never return to teaching in England,” she says.As the new school year gets under way, an Education Policy Institute report has highlighted how the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers to stem the flow of experienced staff leaving the profession has led to a “severe shortage” in England’s schools.“There’s a toxic mix of factors, created by this government, that is making teachers decide they cannot teach in England in particular any more,” says Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union. “The low net pay of teachers means many cannot even afford rent. There is systemic overworking, with teachers routinely working 55 hours a week, and a vicious accountability system, which means teachers are not given the time and support to get better at what they do.” It reflects badly on the government, she says, that so many highly qualified teachers are going abroad. “It’s not that they don’t want to teach, it’s that they don’t want to teach in the context we’ve created in this country, and the government is responsible for that. We are haemorrhaging teachers, particularly at secondary school level.”Teaching timetables in the UK are similar to the OECD average. “But our teachers spend twice as long as other teachers in high-performing OECD countries preparing lessons, assessing and looking at data. It is that, combined with low pay, which is driving teachers away. The very measures the government has taken to police standards are decimating the numbers of teachers in the classroom and lowering educational standards.”Meanwhile, four in five British international school teachers say they are happy or very happy with their new jobs, according to the Cobis survey. “Other countries exercise much more trust in their teachers,” says Bousted. “They enable their teachers to concentrate on what’s important.”Over the next 10 years, it is expected that international schools will require up to 230,000 more teachers to meet staffing needs – 145,000 of them will be recruited from the UK, ISC Research predicts. If so, according to Schools Week, international schools could snap up more than half of all the UK’s trainee teachers over the next 10 years to meet their targets.According to Nick Gibb, the schools minister, more than 14,000 teachers returned to teaching last year, many of whom had been working abroad. “A period teaching in another country has always been an option which adds to a teacher’s experience,” he said.In Italy, Odell enjoys lower living costs and free lunches, so expects to be better off despite a lower salary. “I feel optimistic that I’ll develop as a teacher here while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.”She says: “We had very limited resources. If you have a child with significant behaviour challenges because of childhood trauma, you need access to a clinical psychologist. For example, there was a child we worked with tirelessly to keep in school, to keep him safe. He absolutely needed specialist support but children’s mental health services said they were taking only life-threatening cases.”The child was later excluded from junior school. “Despite government spouting off about the importance of early intervention, it wasn’t there. Due to this lack of resources, the needs of very young children at my school were not being met.”The job left her with high blood pressure and, like her colleagues, she suffered chronic stress and insomnia. “I feel like I’ve done my bit and I was not prepared to compromise my personal health.”With 23 years’ experience as a teacher, 12 as a head, she found it easy to get a job abroad, choosing Jeddah because the teaching profession seemed highly valued there. Now her earnings are tax-free, her transport to work is paid for, and she has a complementary two-bedroom flat. “It’s the equivalent of getting a six-figure salary in the UK.” She is not sure she will work in Britain again.Jenny Anderton (not her real name), 51, who taught at state primary schools in southern England for more than 10 years, says that in the UK she was “more of a social worker than a teacher”. She is now teaching in Seville. “I love teaching, but it was frustrating at my UK school – there was a lot of paperwork and meetings for the sake of meetings,” she says.The last straw came when a child who had severe emotional issues was excluded. “I had flagged up that he needed help. He was a child in crisis.” Instead of supporting him, the school involved the police when he bit another teacher. Anderton’s wages are £500 less a year but she is confident she will be better off because of the lower cost of living. “I’m looking forward to being appreciated, rather than having the whip cracked over me all the time, and enjoying my job again, rather than being comatose at the end of every half term. The focus in the UK on attainment, when social services is on the brink, is bonkers and exhausting. I’m not planning to ever go back.”“Teaching in the UK is a thankless task,” says Victoria Mitchell, 39, who has taught at state primary schools in Nottingham for 11 years. She took a job at an English language school in Puglia, Italy, this month. “In the UK we’re set unrealistic targets and, compared to when I started, there’s little support. Things just get swept under the carpet.”She left a previous school after she discovered a leader from the academy chain lurking in the corridor, monitoring her teaching through a window. “I felt I was constantly being watched.”Her GP advised her to get a new job and, along with 11 other experienced teachers at that school, she did. But her new school was equally stressful. “Everybody was still under immense pressure. I love teaching PE, music and art and am passionate about languages. But in the UK, the focus is entirely on maths and English.”After holidaying in Puglia, she decided to send her CV to all the language schools there and received three job offers. “I chose the one that seemed the best fit for me.”On her last day of the UK summer term a parent yelled in her face. “I drove home from my final ever day in a primary school in this country in tears.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edadf29b9629799f47bfd59410d3263c5c2449cc/0_234_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a12539d8744ffee02978f99b1604f237","title":"10 steps to starting your own creative business","story":"If you like the idea of launching a startup, but you’re not sure where to begin, here are some top tips to get you going – from hooking the market to cooking up investmentFancy unleashing your inner entrepreneur and setting up your own business? For those with a creative streak, this can be a daunting proposition. You may see yourself as an artist, designer or maker rather than a business manager. But many creative businesses are thriving in the modern economy – such as in fashion and interiors, digital development and graphic design, advertising and marketing – and creative entrepreneurs are flourishing.If you can combine your creative ability with an entrepreneurial mindset, you could make a healthy living from your talent while retaining a high degree of independence. But competition in the creative industries is massive and fear of failure looms large for many people. So how on earth do you go about making a success of a new venture? Here are the key questions to ask yourself and issues to consider as you ponder starting out on your own.1. What problem are you solving?Business advisers say that every business idea should solve somebody’s problem. This may come as a surprise if, for instance, you are setting up a cake business. But since cakes are on sale everywhere, why are yours any different? They may solve the problem for people seeking lower calorie cakes or low-cost party cakes, for instance. Entrepreneurs can succeed by offering novel solutions to old problems.2. Test your productWhatever your business idea, it is essential to test that it has a strong appeal and a discernible market. This is the all-important market research stage, where you find out who your potential customers are and how they feel about your product. Only by market testing can you hone the product into something successful. You should be prepared to radically change the idea in response to trials before any wider-scale plans.3. Identify your customersDefining your market is a key element of market research. If you’re selling dog baskets then your target market is dog owners. The next stage is finding ways to locate and connect with them. Social media offers effective lifestyle targeting and is relatively cost effective.4. Research your competitorsBecome an expert on your competitors, find out their strengths and weaknesses and look for areas where you can outcompete them.5. Come up with a business modelThe business model is the method and means you use to run the business. Are you selling from a physical shop or via e-commerce? Do you take payment in advance or by subscription? Innovative business models help entrepreneurs thrive in existing industries that are already heavily catered for, as Spotify has in music (through its subscription model) and Uber has in travel (with taxis ordered and paid for via an app). Don’t be put off by having a product that is already widely available, just try and think of a new and interesting angle to market it.7. Raise financeThe boom in entrepreneurial businesses in recent years has been fuelled by angel investors and venture capitalists. These are talent spotters with the funds to back new ventures they believe in. Banks also lend funds to small businesses, though in the current climate they are highly risk averse. Any serious backer will demand to see a well worked out business plan. This needs to detail market research and present a strong argument about why the product or service will succeed. It needs an informed estimate of the funding needed and a prediction of future sales. Watch The BBC’s Dragons’ Den to see how easily such plans can be pulled apart under rigorous scrutiny. That said, don’t be put off by rejection. Persistence can pay off. And you could always try crowdfunding through Kickstarter, Indiegogo or Crowdfunder.8. Big bang, slow burn or delayed launch?If you have a new and exciting offer, a big bang launch can be a great opportunity for maximising publicity and gives a date to work towards. But many creative businesses will build up gradually as they gather a head of steam. It could be worth creating a launch further down the line when you have some business experience to boast about.9. Cashflow! Cashflow! Cashflow!Getting paid for your services in a timely fashion is vital to the long-term survival of the business. This may be out of the entrepreneur’s hands, but it is important to understand payment cycles in the industry and factor payments into sales projections.10. Can you bootstrap?Bootstrapping – as in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – means running your own business, at least initially, without external funding, and ploughing the income from your activities back into the business. For many creatives, this could be quite feasible, if they sell their services on a freelance basis anyway. Once your business idea takes off, the bootstraps can be untied as you start attracting interest and funding from venture capitalists. Fundamental to the successful businesses of the future will be the way in which they adapt harnessing the power of creative thinking and innovation.Falmouth University’s business school offers courses where creativity meets commerce, and ideas and entrepreneurship are given space to grow. Combining industry experience and academic study, students are given the chance to establish their own start-ups, initiatives or services as part of their degree. They work in a collaborative, supportive environment, benefitting from the university’s industry connections and the first-hand business experience of tutors. With a history of more than 100 years of creative education, Falmouth University is now a hub of innovative digital activity, and continues to encourage cross-disciplinary work among staff and students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25235de435e01b5a341a6e66edf0fabf40a92465/0_115_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b860559fd28b1b3c5043baf1920c9126","title":"ghesquieres sci fi silhouettes take flight for louis vuitton at paris show","story":"Neat jackets and A-line dresses grace Louvre courtyard catwalk as designer ‘obsessed with empowering women’ closes fashion week“Every piece that I designed for this collection, I asked the question: is it powerful for a woman to wear this? Does it give her strength?”You don’t get to be the designer who closes Paris fashion week without having something to contribute to the cultural conversation. Nicolas Ghesquière, whose collection for Louis Vuitton was staged on a catwalk in one of the elegant internal courtyards of the Louvre, said this show was “about my obsession with empowering women. In the last two months the question of what it means to be a woman has felt so important so, this time around, I wanted to make that the only criteria. There is no other narrative to this collection, no story. It’s just about dressing women to empower them.”If you have never been to one of Ghesquière’s catwalk shows for Louis Vuitton, try picturing what Coco Chanel might wear to a Star Wars convention, and you start to get the idea. Elite Parisienne travels to space is Ghesquière’s signature aesthetic. “It’s not an armour, it’s more like a shell. It’s architecture, it gives strength.” The silhouette is always neat, as if mindful of economy of space, although the travel theme that dominates the history of Louis Vuitton is more often than not abstract these days: where once it sold steamer trunks, the house now sells miniature suitcases barely larger than a passport, and clutch bags in the shape of spaceships.In May, parent company LVMH made the unusual step of announcing that Ghesquière, who arrived at Louis Vuitton on a five-year contract in 2013, had signed a new contract to stay as designer. Deals between designers and brands are generally done behind closed doors, so the move amounted to a very public statement of faith in Ghesquière’s vision for Vuitton, which amounts to a modernist, almost sci-fi, take on bourgeois-chic classic silhouettes. Neat jackets, A-line dresses, narrow trousers and fluid dresses are the keystones of a high-fashion look that in turn sprinkle stardust on a robust business in handbags and leather goods. Louis Vuitton is the world’s biggest luxury brand, generating almost 8bn euros in annual revenue, accounting for the bulk of LVMH profits. For it to be in safe hands is of paramount importance to its owners. The statement that accompanied Ghesquière’s re-signing credited him with “unprecedented” growth in Louis Vuitton womenswear. “He has established a strong, daring Louis Vuitton aesthetic imbued with the spirit of the house and his own sensibility,” said chairman Michael Burke. The appointment of Virgil Abloh to menswear designer of Louis Vuitton earlier this year was a throw of the dice by LVMH, who are betting on streetwear continuing to dominate men’s fashion. Ghesquière, by contrast, comes from a more traditional background. Backstage after the show, reporters debated the exact number of male models who had figured in the show – some thought it was two, others counted four. “Actually, you know what? They were all girls, even in the menswear,” said Ghesquière. “That was the point. There was a real ambiguity. Everyone thinks a woman dressed as man gives her power, but it’s more complex than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06e6b6d2436a53c4f134e691b2b612fb3e01dd1/0_138_4485_2691/master/4485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d08f9b30881803bd7898693e8940082","title":"karl lagerfeld catwalk beach chanel show paris fashion week","story":"Grand Palais in Paris decked out with blue sky and sandy shore for spring-summer 2019 collectionIt was a grey autumnal day in Paris. But at the Chanel show in the Grand Palais, Karl Lagerfeld ensured that summer stuck around for a bit longer. The designer, who previously brought a Chanel supermarket and a rocket bearing the brand’s signature double “C” logo to fashion week, doesn’t do things by half. This time, a beach was recreated that included an ocean with gentle waves, blue sky, wooden docks and lifeguards. To complete the scene, the former Baywatch actor Pamela Anderson watched the proceedings from the front row.The sound of gulls signalled the show had started and the first model strolled through the waves, shoes in hand. The beach theme went on to include bikinis and swimsuits, sun hats, a bag shaped like a beach ball, macs for rainy days and a parasol print.However, Chanel didn’t forgo it’s signature style: models wore colourful tweed skirt-suits and some carried several handbags at once. Then there were the iconic logos: the show featured Chanel-emblazoned swimwear, jackets, knitwear, earrings and hair slides, much of which will appeal most to the millennials who lust after vintage Chanel from the 80s.This generation may also approve of the brand’s sustainability drive. In a post-show announcement, Chanel said the water used for the scenery would be reprocessed by the Paris sewage system and the sand recycled by the construction industry.Coco Chanel, the brand’s founder, had a longtime love affair with the beach. She would holiday in the seaside resort of Deauville in the south of France, and the sea was a constant inspiration, with Breton tops and sailors’ jackets featuring in many of her collections. She has even been credited with making sunbathing fashionable after being photographed in the 1920s after a Mediterranean cruise.The beach remains central to the brand. In June, Chanel launched the Coco Beach collection in 26 stores. The limited edition line features espadrilles, summer bags and cover-ups. And last month the fashion house announced it had bought the British men’s premium swimwear brand Orlebar Brown, whose fans include the UK’s former prime minister David Cameron. The acquisition joins Eres, a women’s swimwear brand Chanel bought in 1996."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f19a5e40359d2b16454b886c43e32afa8cb56e60/0_125_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a47c75ce6d44eda7dd9d71b0a0e6b806","title":"why bradley cooper is the real star of a star is born","story":"A revelatory turn from Lady Gaga in the musical remake might have hogged the headlines but with a deeply felt performance and slick direction, the actor deserves awards buzz tooIf you’ve so much as grazed the reviews for Bradley Cooper’s full-hearted, grandly entertaining reworking of A Star is Born, you’ve witnessed a lot of critics racking their brains for suitably ecstatic synonyms for “revelation”, ideally in conjunction with some spin or other on the film’s title. The beaming recipient of these superlatives, of course, has been Lady Gaga, whose first big-screen leading role has been hailed as some kind of perspective-shifting force of nature: “We knew she could sing and dance and wear meat with some flair, but who knew she could act?” (At this point, Golden Globe voters may remind us that they gave her an acting prize two years ago critics will promptly hiss at them to pipe down.)Gaga is very good indeed in the film, though some of the praise for her performance has misleadingly created the impression of a one-woman show. A Star is Born has always, in all its iterations, been an actors’ duet: just as out-of-the-blue pop star Ally (Gaga) is first enabled, then emboldened and, finally, given a cruel emotional education by dissolute country-gravel growler Jackson Maine (Cooper), it remains a song of female self-realisation that relies, admittedly none too progressively, on male anguish as its bassline.As with all aspects of his unfussily accomplished directorial debut, Cooper directs his glittering co-star with a sure, generous hand. But his own performance isn’t merely holding up his end of the bargain: it’s pretty damn spectacular in itself, an exercise in old-school movie star swagger with all its flayed masculine insecurities and frayed nerve endings exposed. Couple that with a credible bourbon-rock croon and arena presence, and his performance is as image-expanding in its own way as Gaga’s: it’s not the one that’s hogging the headlines, but it may be the rough, scarred heart of the film.If no one is calling Cooper’s work on screen revelatory, that’s because it isn’t. Anyone who’s been paying attention is long past being surprised by his unexpected transition from glib Hollywood dude-bro to leading man of sly, soulful conviction the smarmy yuks of his star-sealing turn in The Hangover feel a lot more than nine years ago. Since then, he’s scooped up three acting Oscar nominations, each one well-earned. David O Russell rightly saw something agitated and unhinged behind the actor’s all-American lacquer, and tapped it to electric effect in Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle Clint Eastwood, on the other hand, got Cooper to retreat into his muscular bravado, to brilliantly disquieting effect, as PTSD-raddled military marksman Chris Kyle in American Sniper.Cooper’s Jackson Maine sits somewhere between what Russell and Eastwood identified in him at a variety of volumes, he’s become a go-to man for outwardly strapping, inwardly ruptured middle-American masculinity. He may be the least suave or sexy incarnation of the character through the film’s various versions marked by a cold streak of damage that bubbles all the way up to his mottled pastrami skin — a subtly transformative triumph on the part of the makeup team — it’s a performance that perhaps shares more DNA with the ruined Nashville crooners played by Robert Duvall in Tender Mercies and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart. (They both won Oscars don’t be surprised if Cooper extends the pattern.)Duvall and Bridges are lofty points of comparison for an actor who, at one point, looked like he might have peaked playing Jennifer Garner’s dorky best friend in Alias. But Cooper, like Bridges in particular, is an actor who has grown more interesting the more he has worked against his golden-boy image, whether destabilising it as feverishly as in Silver Linings Playbook, or playing up the smoothness to sinister, even uncanny effect, as in Limitless. Both those films are unusual showcases for a Hollywood leading man, foregrounding his character’s mental health imbalances ahead of his charms and more stoic weaknesses. Cooper’s willingness to play such damage – not always nobly so, and straying into outright arsehole territory on more than one occasion – makes him a particularly 21st-century screen idol, a Warren Beatty for the era that recognises and medicates toxic masculinity.And like Beatty, an actor whose varnished beauty frequently stopped him just short of warmth, Cooper’s transition into film-making allows him to control that complicated screen image in newly exciting ways. (It’s also telling that he inherited the Star is Born directing gig from Eastwood, who moved behind the camera to expand a tough-guy screen presence that other film-makers were less inclined to challenge.) He has already lined up a Leonard Bernstein biopic as his second directorial outing, handing himself the role of the brittle, sexually conflicted composer you’d call it casting against type if Cooper weren’t already making his “type” such a fragile, fractured notion.His performance in A Star is Born feels like a complex summation of his career progress to date: a brooding study in traditional maleness, forced into critical self-examination. “Maybe it’s time we let the old ways die,” he keeps singing in a recurring refrain. Lady Gaga may be the film’s revelation, but it’s Cooper we’re invited to reconsider."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d50ce5dafc1c25e12803034fd9d8c3d703a2b6a2/0_0_2177_1306/master/2177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8245dfc791973f8a6df3762db56e9ff9","title":"gini wijnaldum mo salah jurgen klopp liverpool napoli champions league","story":"• Midfielder says Salah can match Messi and Ronaldo• Klopp: ‘Mo is not someone who is scared of pressure’In the oppressive heat of the press room at the Stadio San Paolo, Jürgen Klopp made it very clear he would not join the debate over Mohamed Salah’s form. “Be relaxed, completely relaxed,” was his final piece of advice to the Liverpool striker, having straight-batted several questions on a subject he considers overblown. Gini Wijnaldum then replaced his manager in the press room. “I’ve told Mo he’s got to get more hat-tricks,” said the midfielder. “He’s had enough of scoring twos, he has to get threes.”As manager, Klopp has to be more careful with public demands of a crucial player and there is certainly foundation to his argument that Salah’s start – so similar to that of last season – would not have attracted so much focus had Liverpool other things to worry about. As things stand they do not: sitting top of their Champions League group going into Wednesday’s game with Napoli, second in the Premier League only on goal difference as they prepare for Sunday’s showdown with Manchester City at Anfield and still unbeaten in the league thanks to Daniel Sturridge’s 89th-minute equaliser at Chelsea on Saturday.Wijnaldum has less reason than Klopp to play the diplomat and, as well as revealing his own instructions to the Egypt international, believes there are ramifications to last season’s phenomenal return of 44 goals for the 26-year-old. Namely, Salah set a standard that has to be maintained for the comparisons with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to continue.“I told him I expect more hat-tricks this season, last year there was only one, and he said I was right,” said the Wijnaldum, increasingly influential himself this term. “I told him: ‘Mo, you are a top player. If you look at Messi and Ronaldo they score a lot of hat-tricks – you have to do the same if you want to compete with them.’“Against Chelsea he had three chances where he could score a goal. He could have given an assist to Roberto Firmino too. I don’t think it’s that bad, put it that way. When he doesn’t score people are going to say he’s not in good shape. I don’t see the difference. I think he had scored one more last season than he has this year. That is the only difference.”Klopp would not disclose whether he had spoken to Salah after his substitution at Stamford Bridge, claiming to do so would make the issue much bigger. He said: “His game is really good. His last game was really good – he was in the positions but then the last two balls were not too cool. That happens. He lost balls in those situations last year. The quality is there and so everything is fine.”If there is pressure on Salah, however, pressure of his own making, then Wijnaldum has no doubt the forward has the personality to thrive upon it. “I said: ‘Mo, it’s not only one year,’ and he said: ‘You’re right.’“We were joking but if someone can deal with pressure it is Mo. Last season he had pressure when people were saying he had to be the top scorer in the league. We told him he couldn’t let anyone catch him. When he was on 18 goals he said: ‘In my head I can do the 32.’ Mo is not someone that is scared of pressure. He embraces the pressure. He knows that he can do it.”Liverpool can take firm control of Group C by following their thrilling victory over Paris Saint-Germain with a defeat of Napoli, who drew their opening match at Red Star Belgrade. Carlo Ancelotti, the Napoli manager, believes Liverpool’s consistency under Klopp has returned them to the elite of European competition but his counterpart was not taken by the niceties. “As we say in Germany he is a smart fox, saying all these positive things about us before the game,” said Klopp. “I am ready for a real battle.”He added: “So far yes, it looks like we are more consistent. Now we have show it again. Consistency must be judged at the end of the season. We did the job so far. Two of my favourite games, one we lost and one we drew. I was happy with those experiences against Chelsea. Now let’s play football again.“This is a different challenge. They do not play like they did last year. They have 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2 where they defend properly but if you lose the ball they are really on their bike. Tomorrow, we need to be at our highest level because this is a tough place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a615785d0adf52abd2dc364f15fa75fdeff54e20/152_0_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=644a3ec9026513b9e7f89f2f4d4792dd","title":"jose mourinho happy manchester united improvement valencia champions league","story":"• Former midfielder said Mourinho was ‘embarrassing the club’• Manager again laments lack of ball-playing central defenderJosé Mourinho defended his players after their latest stuttering performance, claiming he was pleased with the effort and commitment even if there were things he would rather not say about certain aspects of the 0-0 draw with Valencia.“I was pleased with the improvement from Saturday,” the Manchester United manager said. “I was not pleased with the result, but it is not a bad result.”Asked whether the team was low on confidence Mourinho did not give a direct answer, even though the evidence is clear. “There are things it is difficult for me to say, I do not want to attract any more criticism for being too open,” he said. “I would prefer to say that last season we finished second in the league, were runners-up in the FA Cup and topped our Champions League group. I thought that was a fantastic season and I know the reasons why.”If that seemed to be a veiled reference – yes, another one – to the fact that United failed to upgrade their squad with an extra central defender in summer, Mourinho was more explicit in a television interview when he claimed his centre-halves do not have the technical ability to play out from the back. Eric Bailly in particular appeared to support his argument, though in fairness his partnership with Chris Smalling was the sixth different partnership United have fielded in central defence in 10 games this season.One of Mourinho’s fiercest critics has proved to be Paul Scholes, who said on BT Sport before the game that Mourinho was embarrassing the club and was lucky not to have been sacked already. “I am not interested in that, I don’t need to know what Paul Scholes said,” Mourinho said. “He has freedom of speech just like anyone else, just like the fans who were chanting ‘attack, attack’ in the second half. People can say what they like, especially Manchester United supporters, because I respect their point of view.”Mourinho said the reason the kick-off had been delayed by five minutes was that the police failed to provide an escort from the team coach, which then took 75 minutes in heavy traffic to travel the short distance from the Lowry hotel to the stadium. “It’s a journey we normally do in less than half an hour,” the manager explained. “We tried everything, but we were informed that the police had refused to give us an escort to the game so we were late.”Greater Manchester Police said escorts were provided only “on occasions when there is intelligence or information to suggest a risk of threat or harm to the players”. Its statement added: “GMP has previously used police vehicles to accompany a team’s coach but after a review of our core policing responsibilities it was decided that we would no longer provide this service at every fixture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0d1637c43a25c5b322d9a63501dba2f93d1f68/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c300c59a044c8103e85429eb0606474b","title":"mauricio pochettino ernesto valverde tottenha barcelona","story":"Mauricio Pochettino was, by his own admission, living inside the typical footballer’s bubble. Ernesto Valverde was the man who popped it and, boy, did it come as a shock. It was the summer of 2006 and Valverde had been installed as the new Eyol manager. Pochettino was one of the club’s senior players, the most influential voice in the dressing room.Too influential, Valverde thought. He decided he did not want Pochettino in the squad, having been led to believe he undermined his predecessor, Miguel Ángel Lotina. Pochettino has always denied this. “In football, there are people who live off confusion and you sometimes don’t know who the good and bad apples are,” he wrote in his autobiography, suggesting Valverde had been misinformed.But the decision was the decision and, at 34, it spelled the end of Pochettino’s playing career. He said his farewells at a highly charged press conference, in which he broke down in tears and had to leave the room to compose himself.It was tough for Pochettino to accept but time has healed the wounds and when the Tottenham manager encounters Valverde on the touchline at Wembley on Wednesday night, before the Champions League Group B tie against Barcelona, he will embrace him.“That day, it was difficult to understand his position but I talked to him in pre-season, when we played Barcelona in Los Angeles, and I completely understand,” Pochettino said. “He arrived at Eyol at not a good time for me. I could not see it at the time but I can now.“In football, you are always protected by this bubble and then, when somebody shows you the reality, it can surprise you. These things show you that situations in life and in football change very quickly and, when one door closes, many others open. I never wanted to be the victim and I am now going to face the coach who gave me the opportunity to become a coach.”Pochettino is pathologically opposed to presenting himself as the victim and, as he considered an injury crisis that has stripped him of four, maybe five, starting players, he was defiant. Hugo Lloris is back in goal after a thigh problem but Jan Vertonghen, Serge Aurier, Mousa Dembélé, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli are out – together with the backup goalkeeper, Michel Vorm.“I never make excuses if players are injured,” Pochettino said. “We are not going to win or lose because we have some players out. We believe we are going to win – with young players, senior players, I don’t care – because it’s Tottenham that is going to play. We need to build that mentality if we want to win some trophies. I repeat again. I am not the victim and I am not going to be the victim in football and in life.”Pochettino will attack the problems in front of him with gusto and yet, at the same time, he was happy enough to highlight them: to explain why this season “will be the most difficult for us”. He made the now obligatory reference to the delay in the completion of the new stadium and he gave the impression that it was unsettling the club have no base so they can merely busk it from game to game.Pochettino also flagged up the looming fixture black spot, in which his team must play four times in nine days – including the Carabao Cup tie at West Ham. It has been caused, in part, by the necessity to move the home match against Manchester City to Monday 29 October, because Wembley was not available on the day before and the new stadium is not ready.“The ambition is to win but maybe reality, and dreams and perception, are not in a good balance today,” Pochettino said. “It’s difficult to say if the team will be better or improve from last season because the circumstances this season are so tough.“Look at what is going to happen in the Carabao Cup. We are going to play on the Monday against City, then the Carabao Cup tie on Wednesday or Thursday and then we must play on Saturday at Wolves and in the Champions League the following Tuesday against PSV Eindhoven. It is completely unfair for a team that wants to win titles.“We don’t know when we are going to play in the new stadium and everything like this makes you more cautious to guess what will happen. We will see what happens at the end of the season when we will settle ourselves, the fans and the team in the new stadium. Then, we can start to talk about objectives but, today, we can only be focused on the next game.”Spurs are fortified by their Champions League victory over Real Madrid last season, although Pochettino pointed out he could not motivate the players in the same way. “That was the most important game they had played but since then, they’ve played at the World Cup,” he said. For Pochettino, the challenges keep on getting bigger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc57893c27b62c666194aac031b36dd747bac74c/507_33_1897_1138/master/1897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf5be7ffbda6e52d70f4e3908a0aba7e","title":"pep guardiola manchester city relief hoffenheim","story":"Pep Guardiola admitted Manchester City played with some fear in the first half against Hoffenheim but said they were more intense after the break, as they forced a late David Silva goal to secure a 2-1 win in their second Champions League Group F match.City fell behind to a goal from Ishak Belfodil inside 60 seconds at the Rheine-Neckar-Arena and while Sergio Agüero soon equalised they had to wait until the 87th minute for Silva’s finish to claim victory.In light of the home defeat by Lyon in City’s opening game, Guardiola was especially pleased. “After the last game it was so important that we didn’t lose. A win in Germany is always so complicated and we will learn so it’s a good three points because we fought against a lot of things,” he said, before admitting City were tentative before the break. “We played with a little bit of fear. We were more intense in the second half. They are so well organised defensively – it was not easy but at the end we found the right moment to win the game.”Guardiola was unhappy at Leroy Sané being denied a penalty when Oliver Baumann appeared to pull him down in the second half but the City manager – who was serving a touchline ban when City lost to Lyon at the Etihad – refused to discuss this afterwards. “I don’t want to talk because if I do I will be in the tribune. I want to be on the bench with my players in the next game – on the bench.”Guardiola reiterated his pre-game stance that having to struggle can help the team in the long run. “We have to live it like a club, for the players and myself it will be good,” he said. “This competition – if we are able to go through we’ll have learned about what we have to do to beat opponents, I’m pretty sure. It will be good for our future as a club, our performance today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c9fa6175fb4a55de343f56cd91f60c19db80132/0_84_2958_1775/master/2958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fdfc46f8c43484c7d9132ff4dba66c2","title":"marek hamsik napoli liverpool carlo ancelotti","story":"The talisman’s role has been uncertain since Ancelotti’s arrival and, with Liverpool in town, a solution is not obviousThere is no current player more synonymous with Napoli than Marek Hamsik. It is not just because he is captain, or uniquely identifiable by his mohawk, or the fact that after 11 years in Naples he recently overtook Diego Maradona as the club’s all-time leading scorer. Hamsik and his family have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the city and yet he stays, recently declaring in his autobiography that he would never leave for Juventus, as his former teammate Gonzalo Higuaín did.Yet the truth is that nobody looks more out of place in the latest iteration of this Napoli team than Hamsik. With both Maurizio Sarri and Jorginho departed for Chelsea, the Slovakian has been asked by new manager Carlo Ancelotti to fill Jorginho’s boots at the base of midfield, with mixed results, and it remains possible that Hamsik will be left out of the starting XI for Napoli’s crucial Champions League match against Liverpool on Wednesday night.Things have been on the wane for a while. Previously a perennial starter, Hamsik was dropped to the bench six times in the second half of last season. This season, Hamsik was left on the bench for Napoli’s Champions League opener against Red Star Belgrade, and was not used at all in the league against either Sampdoria or Parma, with Gazzetta dello Sport declaring last month that Ancelotti is “still trying to understand after five games if Hamsik can be his regista. In the games in which he has played there, Hamsik hasn’t excited anyone.”Hamsik lacks Jorginho’s defensive tactical understanding, and is much more effective further forward. For all his 31 years he remains a raw, unpolished entity, a sort-of footballing hyena, a snarling, physical force eager to sniff out a weakness and deliver a telling blow. A deep-lying playmaker he is not.With that in mind, it is impossible to overstate the loss of Jorginho from this Napoli side and we have seen how the Italian has revitalised Chelsea this season. Of the 831 touches Jorginho has made in the Premier League, 762 have been passes. How do you tackle somebody that plays almost exclusively one-touch football? How do you replace him? It’s difficult and this summer was one of unprecedented upheaval for Napoli. Losing arguably their most important player, their manager and goalkeeper (Pepe Reina to Milan) has taken its toll, compounded with new signings Fabián Ruiz and Simone Verdi failing to nail down starting berths despite costing a combined £50m.Napoli are not familiar with this sort of change. The potent attacking trio of Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens and José Callejón have been playing together for five years, the centre-back pairing of Kalidou Koulibaly and Raúl Albiol for four years. So this change in personnel, coupled with Ancelotti’s experimentation in last month’s matches away from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2, has raised questions over whether Napoli are a weakening force – comprehensive wins over Torino and Parma have been book-ended by Saturday’s 3-1 defeat to Juventus and a damaging 0-0 draw away at Red Star.Comparing to last season’s achievements is a tough ask. Sarrismo or “Sarri-ball” – Napoli’s bewildering style of play centred around one-touch possession with the ball and a high press without it – was so unique that it earned its own entry into an Italian encyclopaedia, complete with a doodle of Sarri’s smoking cigarette. Napoli finished with a points haul of 91 in Serie A, a record for a runner-up and a total that would have won the Scudetto in seven of the last 10 seasons.It is in the Champions League that Napoli fans will hope to make the biggest strides under Ancelotti – they have never been beyond the round of 16 and fell well short of qualifying from Group F last season. Perhaps Ancelotti’s strength is that he is not welded to any one tactical system and the hope is that he will retain Sarri-ball in some form for Serie A while giving Napoli a plan B to play against the higher-calibre sides in the Champions League. The 59-year-old spoke candidly about this last month.“How to face Napoli in the Champions League? Maybe we don’t have the experience that other squads have,” he acknowledged. “I don’t want my squad to have only one identity, I want it to have many. My goal is not to take apart the legacy that has been constructed here.”A three-time Champions League winner himself, Ancelotti does have that experience his players are lacking, including two finals against Liverpool with Milan in 2005 and 2007. The same opponents travel to Naples on Wednesday and while it promises to be a tough night for Ancelotti’s defence, the game will be won and lost in central midfield.And so we return to Hamsik and what feels as though it could be a watershed moment for him. If his midfield partners Allan and Piotr Zielinski – coveted by Arsenal – are sure to start against Liverpool, the Slovakian’s future is far from certain. Against the dynamism of Liverpool, selecting him and returning to a 4-3-3 is a gamble. Ancelotti still believes in Hamsik – he convinced him not to leave for China in the summer – but finding the right role for him in a Jorginho-less midfield is easier said than done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

There are plenty of maps, blogs and guided tours cropping up online (more about that below).So what is urban hiking? Well, it’s exactly what it says on the tin: taking on a challenging walk – perhaps at pace – in city and town settings, often with a view to racking up some considerable elevation. Much like a bracing country hike in the Peaks, Alps or Highlands, climbs and descents (either via hills or staircases) are something to be enjoyed and attacked, rather than endured.The appeal of urban hiking is obvious. It’s a great way for city folk to get more exercise without any fancy equipment, it’s a sport that enables locals to discover more about the history and background of where they live and it’s a handy way for older people to get active and to socialise. Best of all? It’s pretty much cost-free.Many of us love to ramble on a weekend away, so it’s odd that when we return to our urban lives we forget how to use our legs, hopping on the bus or tube rather than stretching our limbs. Urban hiking reverses this trend and makes sport of tackling lanes, mews and markets along the way. It can be educational too – lots of guides and maps encourage urban hikers to take in local landmarks and buildings, with notes describing their connections to the history of the area.There are plenty of ways to get involved, too. People living in towns and larger cities can simply look up walking tours aimed at tourists and join these organised treks and hikes. After all, they’re not just designed for the enjoyment of people who are new to the area. Be warned though, if you want to cover a considerable distance you’d be better off striking out alone. Urban walking tours aimed at visitors are often more focused on cramming lots of sites into shorter strolls and focusing on a particular theme or period in history, rather than packing in the miles (or hills).To take to the streets without assistance, you need a bit of preparation. But not much. Armed with a smartphone with a map app and a destination punched in, you should be fine. While a bit of pre-hike research will put you in better stead, you can easily find pre-made routes and loops online to suit your desired distance (and your appetite for hills). The website of walking charity Ramblers has plenty of maps and resources for newcomers and, once you’ve signed up for its free membership, you can get stuck into the in-depth routes and guides. You can also plot your own routes on websites such as Mapometer, which allow you to easily create maps to follow and share.One of the benefits of urban hiking is how little gear you need beyond the basics (and a bit of common sense). It’s sensible to take a small bag with essentials such as water, a sugary snack, such as an energy bar or flapjack, and a light rain jacket. If your phone’s battery is poor, it’s worth packing a back-up or charger, just in case.But beyond that, try not to weigh yourself down – you’re likely to never be too far from a shop, cafe or pub, so cut yourself loose from lugging too much garb. Oh, but don’t forget a box of plasters to treat any sore feet.Thankfully there aren’t any strict rules to adhere to when urban hiking (beyond those you’d normally comply with as a pedestrian), however, one tip is to not use the same road twice along a route. Or to put it another way, you should always aim to cover new ground and not double-back on your previous, outward passage.Other than that, you’re set. What are you waiting for? Pack your bag, pull on some comfy trainers, find a route and hit the streets. There’s a world of stairs to climb out there – last one to the top buys the ice-cream, beers or prosecco!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d67802c08ac5cb4f575ecc9292d9223aa85ec2eb/0_81_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e16f5758ac7741d585f9f69e15c93da","title":"trauma runs deep for children at dire lesbos camp moria","story":"Violent and unsanitary conditions in Moria refugee settlement are exacerbating the horror of fleeing conflict for the 3,000 children who live thereThe drawings tell of trauma. Stormy seas dotted with terrified faces. Lifeless bodies of children floating among the waves. And planes dropping bombs, down on to homes and on to people. Eyes that weep blood.The pencil scrawls were made by children who are part of a growing phenomenon in the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece. All have attempted suicide or serious self-harm since they came to this place.Approximately 3,000 minors live in the Moria camp, which Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) calls a giant open-air “mental asylum” owing to the overcrowding and dire sanitary conditions. Last Tuesday an adolescent attempted to hang himself from a pole. In August, a 10-year-old boy only just failed to take his own life.The camp, among hills dotted with olive trees a few kilometres from the island’s capital town of Mytilene, is home to 9,000 asylum seekers living in a centre designed to hold one third of that number. Migrants live in groups of up to 30 people, crammed into tents or metal containers situated just centimetres apart. Rubbish, scattered everywhere, makes the air almost unbreathable.Most come from war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. They arrive in dinghies from the Turkish towns of Ayvalik or Canakkale. According to aid agencies, the controversial deal brokered between Brussels and Ankara aimed at stopping the flow of migrants to Europe via Turkey, combined with the refusal on the part of European countries to take in asylum seekers arriving in Greece, have transformed Lesbos into an Alcatraz, leaving people imprisoned on the island with no way out.“Although the vast majority of migrants who arrive in Moria are traumatised, after having fled from violent conflicts in their home countries, conditions in the camp have exacerbated their trauma,” says Luca Fontana, field coordinator of MSF on the island. “After two years, some are still awaiting transferral, even if they know they could be deported to Turkey at a moment’s notice. I’ve worked in camps infested with Ebola in Sierra Leone and Guinea, but I guarantee you that this is the worst situation I’ve ever seen.”“Approximately 84 people share a single shower, and 72 people share a toilet,” said a report issued by the New York-based International Rescue Committee. “The sewage system is so strained that raw sewage has been known to reach the mattresses where children sleep.”Life in Moria is a daily battle for survival, with altercations common among the various ethnic groups over something as simple as a meal, and which occasionally degenerate into brawls. Not to mention, according to aid groups, the gang rapes of women attacked inside the camp’s toilets. Physicians and psychologists say that minors are also targeted in the sexual violence.To defend herself, 13-year-old Fatima sleeps with a knife under her pillow. Rape isn’t the only threat this Iraqi girl faces: the other is depression. On 2 September, Fatima swallowed tablets her mother used to take to alleviate the pain of the beatings her husband would unleash on her in Iraq. Fatima was saved by her three sisters, who found her convulsing in the middle of the container that the family shared with 25 other people.“It’s not the first time this has happened,” says Shamsa, Fatima’s mother. “Since we arrived in Moria, she has tried several times to take her life. My daughters have transformed since we’ve been here. They’ve become aggressive. We fled Iraq last May in search of peace, but here in Moria we found hell.”It’s not easy for the parents living in Moria to come to terms with the psychological pain of their children, when at the same time the mothers and fathers themselves have been victims of abuse and violence.“The parents in Moria fear that their children have suffered irreversible psychological damage,” says MSF Greece’s mental activity manager, Giovanna Bonvini. “They come here to the clinic because their children have stopped speaking or because they inflict wounds on themselves. In a short time, the parents begin to suffer the same depression as their children.”The MSF clinic is located just outside Moria. Owing to the stress and the inhumane conditions in the camp, MSF’s Lesbos initiative experiences the highest number of burnout victims among its staff working in aid clinics around the world. It is difficult to work when there is a shortage of physicians. The Greek health ministry provides only one for the 9,000 migrants in Moria.MSF, which has rejected EU funding to protest against the deal between Brussels and Turkey, organised a therapy session last June with dozens of children aged between six and 12 who had attempted suicide or were suffering from depression or self-harming. One phase of the therapy involved a storytelling activity in which kids tried to create a story with drawings and words. The children, mainly Afghan and Syrian, began drawing war scenes, shipwrecks, and eyes that dripped blood.The Regional Authority of the Northern Aegean has given Greece’s ministry of migration a 30-day ultimatum to clean up the camp. The first transfers of people to Athens have already begun. But with Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad ready to launch a final offensive against the last rebel stronghold in Idlib, if more Syrians flee the country, then the population of Moria could exceed 10,000 by winter. Inevitably, children will pay the highest price.The only moments of normalcy Moria’s children get come at a small play area 200m from the camp, built by Salam Aldeen, Iraqi-Danish founder of aid group Team Humanity. Thanks to a private donation, Aldeen has purchased inflatable castles and built a small football pitch. The children arrive en masse around 4pm to watch a cartoon on a large screen.“It’s the only place where they can be kids,” says Aldeen. “In here there are no fights, no altercations between Arabs and Kurds, no violence and no rape. In here they can feel at ease with the world and abandon themselves, at least for a few hours, in the thought that they are not prisoners in Moria.”Names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2d27886a1c1f2e04a91a7f6da2d772971bec3b/0_0_5890_3533/master/5890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc35e9d2480ef8c4e4b351fe079b5507","title":"guardian weekly relaunch news magazine","story":"New-look publication will have slightly increased cover price and greater focus on design is to relaunch its weekly edition as a news magazine and increase its distribution.

They began near St Louis, Missouri, continued to the Pacific Ocean, then returned – a round-trip that took over two years.In 1992, I began a quest to walk all 30 routes in the national trails system. After 25 years of travelling these trails — “walking down a dream” as I have called it — this week I take my final steps on the Lewis and Clark Trail in St Louis, Missouri. Lewis and Clark also ended their journey here in 1806 and I will join in celebrating their achievement as well as the 50th anniversary of the trails network.The Upper Missouri River Breaks in Montana is one of the best stretches of the trail. East of Great Falls I loaded food and supplies into a canoe and began a long voyage downstream, passing the same places Lewis and Clark saw on their trip home. There’s a sublime beauty there that captures the romantic view of the American West.Having walked 34,000 miles across America, as I paddled down Class I rapids I was fascinated, and felt humbled by the ever-changing landscape and geological features of the Upper Missouri. On one afternoon, an eagle flew directly overhead, then an osprey circled above the eagle. As the two birds circled ever higher into the great blue yonder, I sat in wonder, gazing up, watching the osprey get ever smaller until it simply vanished. • lewisandclark.orgBart Smith has walked and photographed all 30 national trails in the US. His photography can be viewed online at walkingdownadream and in this  gallery Length 2,650 miles Route Mexico to Canada, through California, Oregon, and WashingtonBy Monica PrelleDescribed as a “wilderness path in our backyard”, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), goes through 57 major mountain passes, dips into 19 major canyons and meanders alongside more than 1,000 lakes and tarns. For those who don’t have the months – or stamina – needed to walk the entire route, it is broken into sections for shorter, multi-night treks and within those sections are plenty of options for day hikes along the national trail. One of my favourites of these is the seven-mile High Trail with its views of the jagged peaks of the Minarets and other summits of the Ritter Range in California. The river flowing through the polished glacial rock below is dramatic, but it’s the void between the high mountains and low valley that makes onlookers feel small.“Everything is flowing,” the naturalist John Muir wrote of the region, “going somewhere, animals and so-called lifeless rocks as well as water.”Starting at the Agnew Meadows Trailhead near Mammoth Lakes, the High Trail contours the west slope of the Sierra Nevada crest and stays above the river before meeting the headwaters of the San Joaquin at Thousand Island Lake. The High Trail-PCT is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, which s more than 230,000 acres between the John Muir Wilderness to the south and Yosemite national park to the north. I often join this trail – skiing in winter and backpacking in the halcyon days of summer, but mostly running, stopping often. I watch the trail change through the seasons. Snow falling and melting, wildflowers blooming and withering. I see aspen leaves transition from green to yellow, orange and red.My dad, who was never an avid hiker, once went for a walk on the High Trail and returned at dusk so tired that he went to bed without dinner. He told the story of that long walk for the rest of his life.At Thousand Island Lake, the PCT continues north to Yosemite, but the 3,000-metre alpine lake is the final destination for most day hikers. Muir called it Islet, for its abundance of tiny granite islands. Banner Peak’s sharp near 4,000-metre summit ridge rises above the sapphire-coloured water.Hikers have the option to return the same way or via the River Trail for a 14- to 15-mile round-trip. Road transport between trail heads and Mammoth Mountain in summer is by shuttle bus only ($8 adult) – cars are almost entirely prohibited.• Pacific Crest Trail AssociationMonica Prelle is a runner and writer from Mammoth Lakes, California.

A quarter of the trail (550 miles) is in Virginia. Its highest point is 2,025-metre Clingmans Dome in the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee.By Philip WernerIt is the camaraderie of hikers that makes the experience of walking this trail, established in 1937, so special. The Appalachian Trail is a melting pot of nationalities and people of all ages, occupations, social classes, races, and religions. People who hike the trail congregate at the lean-tos each night, spaced every 10 miles or so along the trail, and tell their stories, comparing notes on how they are coping physically. An estimated three million visitors hike portions of the trail each year, which is within driving range of major cities such as Atlanta, Richmond, Washington DC, New York, and Boston. Each year about 2,000 “thru-hikers” complete the trail in one continuous trip lasting from five to seven months. Others hike sections over years to complete the entire trail.The many shorter sections include routes through the Shenandoah national park, and the White Mountain national forest.There are no fees or permits required to hike the trail, which links existing trail systems through numerous national parks, national forests, designated wilderness areas, state parks, and other public lands. It is maintained by an army of volunteers who build shelters, repair eroded sections of trail, and repaint the 150,000 white rectangular blazes that mark the route from one end to the other.My favourite section is the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine, just before you reach the northern terminus of the trail and climb Mount Katahdin (1,605 metres) in Baxter state park. It’s a wild and rugged stretch of mountains, forest, and lakes with little vehicle access and takes 6-10 days to backpack end-to-end. I prefer hiking on the trail in mid- to late- September when it is ablaze with autumn colour, the nights are cool and the biting insects have disappeared.• 12 easy section hikes on the Appalachian TrailPhilip Werner has been section hiking the Appalachian Trail since 2007. He is founder and editor of SectionHiker and lives in New HampshireLength 3,100 milesRoute The Canadian border in Glacier national park, Montana, to the Mexican border west of El Paso, through Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New MexicoBy William R BuckThe Appalachian and Pacific Crest trails both get a lot of attention but the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) offers at least as much adventure, with a fraction of the crowds. The CDT showcases one of the most spectacular parts of the world: the snow-covered Rockies, alpine wildflowers and high-elevation forests. This is a place of massive scale, where remote, rugged lands ide the watersheds of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.Of the “Triple Crown” of long-distance routes (along with the Appalachian and Pacific Crest), the CDT is by far the least-used of the three.Yellowstone national park, on the Wyoming border, has grizzly bears, bison and wolves – but be sure to give all wildlife a wide berth and research current conditions. Turning west the trail intersects with the Nez Perce historic trail, a path of untold stories from one of America’s most celebrated tribes.When camping on the CDT, you can see the stars more vividly than in most places in the US (as long as forest fires aren’t smoking up the skies). Trail towns and gateway communities across the country play an important role in the trail experience (see map). These are places with unique culture, good food, parks and activities appealing to different interests. Silver City in New Mexico and Lincoln, Montana, are two towns that enrich the trail experience.I have walked the many varied routes across the national trails system, but the CDT remains one of the most special to me: it encapsulates the promise of our public lands, vast landscapes that preserve our wild and scenic treasures for future generations – and for wildlife.• The Continental Divide Trail Coalition has free guides and maps.

My favourite follows the edge of the last Ice Age from east to west across Wisconsin.Until 12,000 years ago, massive ice sheets blanketed all of Canada, with the southern fringe of the glaciers dipping down past the Great Lakes. The Ice Age national scenic trail follows a zig-zagging line of rock piles called moraines and other ice age relics – such as long ridge lines called eskers, large boulders called glacial erratics and small basins left by melting ice chunks called kettle ponds – for over a thousand miles. Many of the textbook-worthy geographical features along the trail are protected in the Ice Age national scientific preserve, part of the US national park system.Wisconsin’s rolling landscape alternates between mature forests and open fields connected by streams and rivers that flow into thousands of lakes. The trail meanders along the shore of Lake Michigan, before plummeting south of Madison, the state capital, and then heading north again to undulate across the western half of the state, linking numerous state parks and rural counties. Large sections of the trail, marked by yellow blazes on trees, rocks and fenceposts, are designated hiking-only footpaths others follow scenic backroads perfect for cyclists.This is my favourite long-distance trail because its unique focus on the region’s geological history transports hikers back in time, to an era when the landscape was all wilderness. As you walk, ride or drive in the footsteps of the woolly mammoths that once grazed the lush grasslands cultivated by the retreating glaciers, keep your eyes peeled for porcupines, foxes and black bears. And at night, your ears may ring with the howls of wolves: about 1,000 grey wolves live in Wisconsin, about a third of the endangered Western Great Lakes population.

She is the author of Aerial Geology: A High-Altitude Tour of North America’s Spectacular Volcanoes, Canyons, Glaciers, Lakes, Craters, and PeaksLength 93 milesRoute A circuit around Mount Rainier, Washington, giving views of all sides of the Cascade’s highest volcanoBy Peter PotterfieldRising from its lowland valleys like a vision, 4,392-metre Mount Rainier is the highest of all the snow-clad volcanoes of the Cascade Range. And the 93-mile Wonderland trail offers a truly intimate connection with Rainier, as the route makes a complete circuit of this magic mountain through the moody, rugged wilderness at its feet.The simple desire to climb Rainier was the very thing that brought me to the Pacific Northwest decades ago. There I was, puking on the summit with the other pilgrims who had climbed too high, too fast. Only later did I realise that time spent in the backcountry around the mountain can be even more rewarding. The allure here is the tremendous variety of terrain, which makes for fascinating backcountry travel.To hike all 93 miles of the Wonderland, a designated Recreation Trail, is to take in all the majestic nuances of Mount Rainier’s domain. The 360-degree view of the mountain, under volatile weather and changing light, is reason enough to come. The cathedral-like ancient forests of Douglas fir and western hemlock, the expanses of lovely alpine meadows (locally called “parks”), the high volcanic ridges, and the 35 cubic miles of ice draping the rocky flanks of the mountain all combine for a landscape unique in the lower 48 states. At high points along the route, such as Panhandle Gap, the hiker is taken deep into the alpine zone, into the realm of ice and snow far above the trees.Just be prepared to do a little work. Distinctive radial ridges called “cleavers” reach from high on Rainier right into the surrounding backcountry. These ridges create serious topography, a successive series of obstructing ridgelines above valleys deeply dug by raging glacial torrents. These require multiple climbs above 2,000 metres from deep green valleys, taking the hiker into a high, austere wilderness of ice and rock. Going up and over these ridges means the backcountry traveller who makes a complete circuit gains more than 6,000 metres of elevation in those 93 miles.Not everyone has the time or inclination to hike for months on the longer-distance trails. In my opinion, shorter trails such as the Wonderland bring the biggest reward for time and effort applied.Most hikers set out from the village of Longmire and do the Wonderland in 12-14 days, a period that allows for a relaxed pace, time to appreciate the scenery, and a rain day or two. You can do all in a single push, or in sections over several seasons – even over a decade in two- or three-day stints. The trail is usually hikable from mid-July through September, but depending on the previous winter’s snowfall, trails above 1,800 metres may be covered in snow into August.

Plus 5 more autumn tripsI smell the harvest before we see it – a floral sweetness drifts in the autumn air, while a hint of wood smoke lingers on the nose. I’m on the Somerset Levels, that secret area of wetland bounded by the Mendips, the Quantocks and the Blackdown Hills, and heading to Pass Vale Farm at Burrow Hill, which is a place of pilgrimage for lovers of all things cider. And during September and October, the place is busy.The orchards that surround the farm bustle with machines that grab the trees and shake them until the apples drop. Tractors scoop the fallen fruit from the ground, and the yard is piled high with apples ready for the press. But Julian Temperley, doyen of British cider makers, finds time to stop and chat. The man is a pioneer who, after a gap of 300 years, reintroduced the distilling of cider brandy to England.But the Levels aren’t all about apples and cider. Basket weaving has been big here for millennia, and at Coates English Willow in Stoke St Gregory, I watch the process from raw material to finished product.I start with a tour of the workshops (adult £4.50, child £3). From log and shopping baskets to picnic hampers and tea trays, everything is handmade using centuries-old techniques. The warm smell of damp willow fills the air and is accompanied by the rhythmic sound of snipping and creaking.Footpaths lead from the workshops past newly processed willow rods (used to make baskets rigid) drying in the autumn sun, and down to fields where the willow is being grown. Planted in plots drained by the River Tone, they twitch and clack in the breeze, and are a haven for wildlife.The RSPB helps maintain the area as an internationally important habitat for wildlife of all kinds. The charity is also a partner in the Great Crane Project, which saw the reintroduction of cranes at a secret location on the Levels after an absence of 400 years. Brought over as eggs from Germany, the first birds were released in 2010, and now the population has risen to almost 100. The cranes are not easy to find – I took a walk along a stretch of the Parrett Trail, a 50-mile footpath that follows the River Parrett from its source in the hills around Chedington, Dorset, to Burnham-on-Sea – and although I’d been told by Ellie, our guide at Coates English Willow, that these magnificent metre-high birds were often seen in the meadows and fields I strolled through, I was unlucky.Before returning the bike, I called in at Muchelney pottery, where John Leach (grandson of Bernard Leach, the “father of British studio pottery”) makes his wood-fired pots (johnleachpottery). I bought a beautiful bowl that seemed to reflect the light of the surrounding landscape in its soft, orangey glaze, and then it was back to Langport through the glow of the afternoon autumn sun, and on to our hotel.I stayed at the Devonshire Arms (doubles from £90 B\u0026ampB) in Long Sutton.

You swooned to San Junipero. You’ve scratched your head at that one about the angry robot dogs. And now it’s time for the next step: controlling your own Black Mirror episode.Bloomberg reports that the next series of Black Mirror will have an interactive element. According to the report, one episode is being planned around a branching Choose Your Own Adventure narrative, allowing users to move the story forward at set points by clicking one of several on-screen options.This isn’t exactly new territory for Netflix – it has already experimented with the form with its Puss in Book special – but of all its original shows, Black Mirror seems the most sensible choice. Nobody wants an interactive House of Cards episode, for example, unless some of the options include “drift off and wander away” or “delete the last three series out of basic human decency”. But Black Mirror is forward-thinking and open-minded enough to allow such an experiment.Best of all, Black Mirror is the sort of series that nobody can fully agree on. Some people love the dark, grimy episodes that revel in a surface-level nihilism, for instance, and those of us who aren’t 13-year-old boys are more attracted to episodes such as San Junipero or Hang the DJ, where all the grisly future paranoia is replaced with something approaching recognisable humanity.An interactive episode has the potential to be all things to all people. Say it is an episode where a new type of toaster is invented that is powered by the like-clicks underneath a video of someone being maimed. If you’re a dark Black Mirror fan, you can choose a path where all the worst things happen and all the characters end up broken and bleeding, their bodies spelling out the word “WHY?” on a burning hilltop as every Radiohead song ever recorded plays simultaneously in the background. But if you’re an optimist, you can pick a path that allows the orphan to fall in love with the toaster inventor, and for them to break free of the oppressive system that created them both, before the inevitable twist ending reveals that they’re both actually molecules in a dying man’s fart cloud. See? Something for everyone.Better yet, whatever this episode turns out to be about, it will be the most watched episode of Black Mirror ever. Interactive narratives are always watched and rewatched over and over, as viewers try to discover every permutation of every story. The interactive film Tender Loving Care, for example, begged people to rewatch, not least because some of the options resulted in gratuitous nudity. And I’ve watched Puss in Book more times than I’d care to admit, even though it really isn’t very good at all.Something like Black Mirror would amplify this. Any given episode is already subject to countless recaps, but this would allow recappers to argue among themselves over which string of decisions made for the most compelling story. It might even bring about a whole new way of reviewing television, even though the world absolutely does not need that.And, of course, Netflix would be deluged with usable data. Every choice made by every user would signal a preference of storytelling that the platform can use to its advantage. It already knows the shows that certain ultra-specific demographics are most likely to watch, but an interactive Black Mirror will go one further. It will reveal the inidual story beats that each demographic favour at any given time in an episode.Soon it will be able to predict how every single episode of television we ever watch should go, and create an algorithm that writes our scripts for us, and we’ll all be trapped in a ceaseless hell of AI-derived storytelling. And, at that moment, Black Mirror will have eaten itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/364e07dc1111c938dd7690a407eae5110b92d273/752_781_4892_2936/master/4892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5117c2b012dc9a07a89d53b9aa4ce1f1","title":"you rang mlord the 90s british sitcom and its unlikely hungarian super fans","story":"The Upstairs Downstairs spoof has been forgotten in Britain. But in Hungary, kids still name their pets after the cast. Our writer travels to Budapest for the lavish 30th anniversary celebrations In the restaurant of an upmarket Budapest hotel, three young sisters are overcome with excitement. They have just spotted their comedy heroes through the window and have crept in, hoping for autographs. Rosie, 13, breaks down in tears as she confides the names of her guinea pigs: Teddy, James and Mr Stokes. “They’re all boys,” she says apologetically, but her rabbit is a girl. “She’s called Ivy.”At a table gleaming with silver and crystal sit the actual Teddy and James – or rather the actors Michael Knowles and Jeffrey Holland. They’re about to tuck into a five-course meal inspired by the British TV series that has made them two of Hungary’s most famous stars. Ivy (Su Pollard) has sent her apologies and Mr Stokes (Paul Shane) is dead. The banquet opens with cream of asparagus soup with roasted lamb’s kidney and ends with tapioca pudding, each with its own accompanying wine – as befits the aristocratic Meldrum family, from the 1920s-set sitcom You Rang M’Lord?For James, the silver service might have come as a surprise. He was a humble footman in the series. Teddy is to the manor born, the “silly arse” son, whose sisters Cissy (Catherine Rabett) and Poppy (Susie Brann) are also at the party, along with housemaid Rose (Amanda Bellamy). In the hotel kitchen, chef Áron Barka is feeling the heat as he puts the finishing touches to a platter of tiny cucumber sandwiches. Is he a fan of You Rang, M’Lord? “Of course”, he says. “I know it by heart.”It’s a refrain that is to be repeated many times over the weekend. It all goes back to 1988, when the TV writer-director duo David Croft and Jimmy Perry devised a comic riposte to Upstairs, Downstairs, using the “family” of actors who had travelled with them through decades of comedy classics, from Dad’s Army to It Ain’t Half Hot Mum and the holiday camp romp Hi-de-Hi!.After a touch-and-go start, when a technicians’ strike nearly scuppered the pilot episode, a full series was commissioned by the BBC. Though You Rang, M’Lord? didn’t hoover up awards like Croft and Perry’s previous work, its ambitious 50-minute format set a new standard in a sitcom era where the normal running length was half an hour. “David and Jimmy always talked of it as the jewel in their crown,” Knowles and Holland agree. The show ran for 26 episodes over four seasons between 1990 and 1993, making household names of the disreputable Meldrums and their long-suffering staff, whose rise and eventual fall it followed from the first world war trenches to the late 1920s.And there it might have remained – a risque little mezzanine in the history of upstairs downstairs comedy – except that Hungary, recently liberated from the Soviet Union, couldn’t get enough of it. The first series was dubbed into Hungarian in 1991, by actors who were all stars in their own right. “First came a Brazilian romcom, then Dallas and then You Rang, M’Lord?” says Eniko Marton, whose film director husband bought her a premium ticket for the festivities as a birthday present. “You Rang, M’Lord was the one that stayed with us.”Thirty years after the pilot went out, not a week goes by without episodes appearing on Hungary’s TV channels. A fan club has nearly 23,000 followers – but as the show’s 30th anniversary came into view, a group of uberfans decided to take it further. They set up a Facebook page and began to track down surviving members of the cast.A small group, headed by medical researcher Zsuzsanna Polgár, made their first move two years ago, travelling to London for a reunion portrait with some of the actors in front of the grand Victorian villa in London’s Holland Park where the Meldrums were supposed to have lived.As word spread, more and more fans wanted to get in on the act, so they created a crowdfunding page to fly the cast to Budapest. Within a month they were forced to shut the page down, after being mobbed by 800 people, who pledged between 5,000 and 20,000 forint (£14–£55) for the chance of an audience with their comedy heroes. This in a country where the average monthly wage is just 200,000HUF.So it is that five British actors find themselves feasting in some of the Hungarian capital’s finest restaurants and being chased through its streets by autograph-hunters. This is all during a hectic timetable of stage and TV appearances, while a national comedy channel runs a 26-hour marathon of all four series through the weekend.In the queue after the ecstatic live event is young radio journalist Adrienn Csepelyi. “From the 50s, we were taught that aristocracy is something we should forget, that good Hungarians work hard all through their lives to build our great socialist country,” she explains.Other fans are more emotional. “Twenty years ago I had cancer,” says 76-year-old Katalin, whose son - a Catholic priest and law professor - has laid on a minibus for a sightseeing tour. “While in chemotherapy, I decided I needed to make sure that every day I laughed. It saved my life.”“You are a gay icon,” a young man with a buzzcut whispers urgently to 58-year-old mother of two Katie Rabbett, one-time girlfriend of Prince Andrew, who claims to have given television its first lesbian kiss as the boyishly elegant, monocle-wearing Cissy Meldrum.At the end, the most symbolic of many gifts are doled out: a pink plastic ukulele for Poppy, who is fondly remembered for an instrumental duet rich in double entendre with James (who gets cufflinks). There’s bottle of Air de Paris perfume for upwardly mobile housemaid Rose, and a red-star brooch for Cissy to honour her progressive views. Teddy (a now 81-year-old Michael Knowles) is mystified by the present of a red rubber-ring that may relate to some plot point he has long forgotten. Perhaps, he muses, it’s standing in for a whoopee cushion. But as any true Hungarian fan would assure him, quoting one of the show’s much parroted catchphrases: “Least said, soonest mended.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec598b028d6c09ccbd9ee5356befee63f9aea9a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06571bfecd7370048842563dbf34780e","title":"most innovative orchestra anywhere los angeles philharmonic turns 100","story":"The orchestra that brought high culture to Hollywood celebrates a century of taking musical risks and seeking to serve its communityResidents of Los Angeles are popularly maligned as shallow and obsessed with the next big thing. But since its first concert in 1919 – when the city was more wild west than Hollywood – the LA Philharmonic has brought live, high culture to the second-largest city in the US.For the opening concert of its centennial season last week, the bold and eclectic LA Phil brought in Coldplay’s Chris Martin and other pop stars. The performance was emblematic of the orchestra, recognized as among the very best in country and which has not been afraid to take risks. That has only increased during the tenure of its star conductor Gustavo Dudamel.As the orchestra begins its landmark season with an unprecedented 50 commissions and an approximately $125m budget – the biggest of any orchestra in the US – the Phil’s place in the cultural scene is only set to increase.One hundred years on, the defining factor of this orchestra is its ability to blend genres and styles to create totally new takes on classical works.The LA Phil’s new CEO, Simon Woods, a British transplant, said it employed an “expansive approach” towards programming, thinking “really, really hard about the kinds of experiences it provides for people from every different background you can imagine”. That results in shows and events based in classical, pop, jazz and world music.The orchestra is, “I think, the most innovative orchestra anywhere with their programming”, said Dr Robert Cutietta, the dean of the USC Thornton school of music, referencing the Phil’s focus on contemporary music and erse festivals.Beyond programming, however, Woods sees a deeper mission, given the weight of the Phil as an arts organization in LA. “You have a kind of big moral responsibility to think about how you make the greatest impact in communities beyond paying audiences,” he said.And it is here where the Phil’s reach may well turn out to be greatest. Beyond world music-themed events like last year’s CDMX (Mexico) and Reykjavik festivals, and free events like this year’s Celebrate LA!, the Phil runs Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, a music education program for low-income communities.“I see literally thousands of children on a different and more promising path than they or their families ever imagined,” said Dudamel, who was a beneficiary of Venezuela’s El Sistema program and holds a belief in music’s “magic power to transform”, he said.The Phil’s reach also extends to the art community at large. For Refik Anadol, a Turkish artist who moved the United States six years ago, the institution supported him out of university to manifest “life-transforming” projects that allowed him to open his studio.For the centennial, he created a visual projection derived from the Phil’s archive – 45 terabytes of data – which is displayed on the exterior of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in patterns determined by machine learning algorithms. “The LA Phil is like a dream machine,” he said.Cutietta said the orchestra “permeates everything” and is responsible for the “whole atmosphere” of things going on in the music community.“There is this whole ‘can do’ attitude here with the arts. The people who are doing classical music are excited about it it’s not (only) a job,” he said, mentioning several pop-up orchestras and experimental work being done here.Despite starting more than 75 years after the New York Philharmonic, the LA Phil quickly caught up, thanks to a rich founder, and has always had a knack for luring top talent from the east coast and around the world, including a list of guest conductors that includes Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, Leonard Slatkin and Arnold Schoenberg.The Phil has also developed its own legends, bringing in promising young men in their 20s and early 30s including Zubin Mehta, Esa-Pekka Salonen, and the exuberant Dudamel.The Phil has not had a gilded ride throughout its history, however.William Andrews Clark Jr, son of one of the wealthiest Americans during that time and a US senator, underwrote the Phil to the tune of $200,000 annually for the first several years.But the Phil would soon hit tough times, along with the rest of the country in the late 1920s – exacerbated by Clark suddenly deciding to cut his funding. The Phil rebounded after successful fundraising campaigns, though its fortunes would continue to yo-yo in the ensuing decades.Reflecting the boom and bust nature of the town when it comes to artistic endeavors, mid-century years would see the Hollywood Bowl close and reopen, the creation of a landmark venue, the Music Center, and later experiments featuring contemporary music, notably with Frank Zappa in 1970.The Phil’s current financial fortunes can be traced back to initiatives enacted by the executive directors Ernest Fleischmann and then Deborah Borda, which led the way to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Phil’s current, Frank Gehry-designed home.Ticket sales at the 17,500 seat Hollywood Bowl, a novel outdoor venue where the orchestra spends its summers, have also been a major source of revenue – one most other orchestras do not have.Throughout its years, from having a female conductor as early as 1925 to being the first symphony to issue a commercial recording of itself outdoors, the LA Phil has always stood as a representation of Los Angeles beyond Hollywood glitz, with its willingness to take bold risks, skepticism of accepted practices, and ability to inspire people well beyond its city limits, and within.“LA is different than other places, and the LA Phil has captured this. They’re not trying to be the Philadelphia orchestra they know who they are,” said Cutietta.Dudamel put it another way: “What they are sensing is our spirit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278f89daa6d4cdb9064d5fed4fc62caeed521602/11_0_3479_2088/master/3479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=214e76d78b1874449a265e50878b4d62","title":"french interior minister resigns in defiance of emmanuel macron","story":"President initially refused to accept resignation of Gerard Collomb, who is quitting to recontest Lyon mayoraltyPresident Emmanuel Macron of France has been forced to accept the resignation of his interior minister’s and early ally Gerard Collomb.Collomb, 71, a former Socialist party stalwart who became one of Macron’s most eager backers, had earlier said he wanted to resign so he could run for election as mayor of his hometown Lyon.“The French people and the people of Lyon need clarity so I maintain my offer to resign,” Collomb responded, when asked whether he would stay on as interior minister after Macron initially turned down his resignation on Monday.“Considering the rumours and the pressure I don’t want the fact I will be a candidate somewhere tomorrow to affect the way forward for the interior ministry,” Collomb said.Late on Tuesday, Macron’s office said the president had accepted Collomb’s resignation and the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, would assume his responsibilities until a replacement was found. Philippe reportedly cancelled a trip to South Africa.Collomb’s comments were seen by critics as an unprecedented challenge to Macron’s authority, coming a few weeks after the 40-year-old centrist was forced to replace his popular environment minister and the sports minister.Two weeks ago Collomb announced plans via a newspaper interview to quit the government and run for mayor of Lyon in 2020, returning to a position he has previously held.He initially indicated that he would resign after European elections in May 2019. But opposition rivals said the comments undermined his legitimacy as the head of one of the most sensitive portfolios in France where Islamist militants have killed hundreds of people since 2012.Collomb had in recent weeks been critical of Macron, speaking of a “lack of humility” in the president’s administration and dismissing expressions often used by Macron, such as “start-up nation”, as out of touch with common folk.A week ago presidential advisers said Macron had made clear to Collomb that the timing of his resignation would be decided by the president himself, who is regarded as running a tight ship with heavy demands on time and loyalty.Macron has said he is determined to do whatever it takes to overhaul the French economy and introduce other social reforms to put the country on a stronger path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6bd7f2c99d70e8f612ed5a65d76f5ff79287b0/0_135_3865_2320/master/3865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f036424cbc752fbccc53dfc990911b","title":"thailand bay made famous by the beach closed indefinitely","story":"Visitors flocked to Maya Bay on Ko Phi Phi Leh island after it was in Leonardo DiCaprio filmOne of the world’s most popular beaches, made famous by the 2000 film The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is to be closed indefinitely to allow it to recover from the damage caused by millions of tourists.The golden sands and crystal blue water of Maya Bay, ringed by cliffs on Ko Phi Phi Leh island, has become one of Thailand’s most-visited tourist destinations since it shot to fame as the movie’s location.The small beach has sustained extensive environmental damage in recent years, receiving up to 5,000 tourists and 200 boats a day.Thai authorities announced they would be temporarily closing the bay from 1 June, but have now extended the planned four-month closure to at least a year, due to the extent of the destruction caused by the thousands of day-trippers.Songtam Suksawang, the director of the national parks department, said: “We have evaluated each month and found out that the ecological system was seriously destroyed from tourism of up to 5,000 people daily.“It’s very difficult to remedy and rehabilitate because its beach was completely destroyed as well the plants which cover it,” he said, adding that it was “impossible” for recovery to occur in the allotted time.Despite evidence of the mounting damage to Maya Bay, for years, Thai authorities had been reluctant to shut it, because the location generates about 400 million baht (£9.5m) in revenue a year.However, a royal gazette published on 1 October by Thailand’s department of national parks, wildlife and plant conservation announced the restrictions on tourism would not be lifted until the ecosystem “fully recovers to a normal situation”.The news will come as a relief to local environmental campaigners, who had said a four-month closure was not nearly enough. Coral only grows about half a centimetre a year, so it will take years for the reef to be fully restored.The Maya Bay park chief, Worapoj Lomlim, said the parks agency and others had already rehabilitated coral reefs in the bay by planting more than 1,000 corals, and would keep expanding the project.Countries across the region from the Philippines to Indonesia are waking up to the problems that can be caused by excessive tourism.In April, the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a six-month closure of the Boracay beach resort, calling the destination a “cesspool”.Indonesia declared a “garbage emergency” last year along a stretch of the island of Bali, after coastal pollution was highlighted in a viral video that showed a er swimming through water full of rubbish."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister for Sport sharply criticised by Battle Arena Ireland for intervention at weekendMinister tells Oireachtas committee Sl\u0026aacuteintecare health reforms on trackSl\u0026aacuteintecare Implementation Advisory Council features people from many backgroundsEmployees of State-funded voluntary health and social services organisations strike dealWoman dies in hospital after incident with truck on Bulfin Road on TuesdayAuthority director apologises after travel disruptions in Cork and Shannon airportsWatchdog says HSE must implement nine recommendations on database used for health planningArchbishop Diarmuid Martin says Pope Francis told Irish bishops not to repeat past clericalismPressing matters identified in KARE organisation which helps the intellectually disabledConsultants identify governance issues at Dublin facilityUK preparing move on the backstop as DUP fears riseDeloitte report also highlights instances of underpayments to housekeeping and other staffLoss of planned project with writer Colm T\u0026oacuteib\u0026iacuten for Inis Me\u0026aacutein a significant blowIndependent TD says Paschal Donohoe gave him \u0026lsquoan overview of how the budget would be structured\u0026rsquoGroup is also digging in on insistence pensioners should be exempt from property taxColleagues knew Peter Fitzpatrick, who will run as independent in next election, was unhappyDUP rejects Irish Sea checks reportedly being considered in British version of \u0026lsquobackstop\u0026rsquoDecision on world-class facility \u0026lsquodamaging and dreadful\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Prof Louise KennyPassengers urged to check with their airlines before attempting to travel"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3649504.1538553378!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"druid theatre withdraws major production from galway 2020","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Garry Hynes, the Druid Theatre’s artistic director, says the theatre company had been forced to pull out due to the Galway 2020 project’s “loss of time, significant budget cuts and communication issues”. File photograph: Cyril ByrneGalway’s Druid Theatre is withdrawing its major international production from the Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture programme.Druid’s artistic director Garry Hynes confirmed to The  that the award-winning theatre company had been forced to pull out due to the Galway 2020 project’s “loss of time, significant budget cuts and communication issues”.“We have raised our concerns with the chair of Galway 2020 and are in ongoing discussions with them,” Ms Hynes said. She was commenting on the eve of the Dublin Theatre Festival opening of the company’s DruidShakespeare: Richard III in the Abbey Theatre. “Like other Galway producers, we want to make 2020 a success which builds upon the work of the Galway cultural community over the past decades,” she said.Ms Hynes said Druid had not pulled out of Galway 2020 completely as it intends to work with it to fund an alternative project that has as yet to be identified. It is understood the company had put two years of work into the Middle Island project, but the budget offered no longer made it feasible.The Druid Theatre decision is a significant setback to a project that is already mired in controversy since the loss of its creative director, Chris Baldwin, in late May. Its chief executive of just over a year, Hannah Kiely, stepped down last month. The Galway 2020 board announced on Tuesday that Galway City Council director of services Patricia Philbin had been seconded to replace Ms Kiely – but there is still no creative lead, in spite of a commitment to appoint one by late July.Druid’s joint production with Galway 2020 was to have been one of several flagship projects in the €46 million programme.The Druid production, entitled Middle Island, was inspired by Colm Tóibín’s novella and play, Testament, relating the story of Mary’s life after the death of her son, Jesus.The collaboration with Corsica and Theatre Cymru, Wales, was to have involved a journey by sea to the Aran island of Inis Meáin from Ros-a-Mhíl in south Connemara, with a cast of 10 professional actors led by Druid actress Marie Mullen and 20 people from the community. Some 20 other artistic projects sharing similar worries to those of Druid are due to meet the chief executives of Galway city and county councils later this week. The two local authorities are major funders of the European designation, with the Government giving the largest amount of the €46 million budget, at €15 million.The group, involving major players Macnas, Music for Galway, Galway Film Fleadh, Fibín, Blue Teapot and Branar theatre companies and Galway Community Circus, is seriously worried about a loss of creative vision, funding shortfalls and poor communication. Already budget cuts to arts groups have been signalled and the group believes the project may only raise half of its target. A source close to the group said it was “united in the aim of working constructively with the two stakeholders to achieve a profound shift away from the non-consultative approach that has brought us to this point”.Galway 2020 did not respond to a request for comment on the Druid decision. Its chairwoman, Aideen McGinley, said it was delighted at Ms Philbin’s appointment.Loss of planned project with writer Colm T\u0026oacuteib\u0026iacuten for Inis Me\u0026aacutein a significant blow"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3649562.1538518641!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"flights resume after severe disruption at cork shannon airports","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork Airport (pictured) is one of the regional airports to have been affected by the failed radar system.

In a statement just before 11pm, the IA said a “technical issue occurred with the Shannon ATC system”. “Safety is the IAA’s main priority and in accordance with normal procedure the IAA restricted air traffic while the issue was being investigated.”After switching to the back-up system, it said “traffic flows are now in the process of being restored to normal capacity”.An investigation is ongoing and despite restrictions having been lifted, those intending on flying from either airport are advised to check in with their airlines. In an earlier tweet, Cork Airport had said a “radar problem in the west of Ireland which covers airspace including Cork Airport is impacting all flights coming from the westsouth of Ireland”. “Anything already in the airspace was processed through or has landed but nothing else is allowed to enter this airspace at present.”Shannon Airport had similarly tweeted: “Air Traffic Control at Ballycasey, Shannon are experiencing issues with their flight radar. Work under way to rectify the situation. Arrivals and Departures at SNN have been suspended until the radar is fully operational.”Shannon Airport has said Aer Lingus flight EI 387 from London Heathrow and Ryanair flight FR3326 from Krakow have both landed there. Earlier it had said the flights would ert to Dublin.Aer Lingus earlier said the following four services had been cancelled:EI912 Knock to London Gatwick. EI249 London Gatwick to Dublin.EI724 Cork to London Heathrow. EI725 London Heathrow to Cork.An Aer Lingus spokeswoman said ground staff is providing those affected with hotel accommodation as required. Those scheduled to fly tonight are advised to check aerlingus prior to departing for airports.

Photograph: Arthur EllisPress22The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) are investigating the technical issue that temporarily shut down radar at Shannon and Cork airports last night.Radar was shut down at both airports in what was ‘likely a software issue’, says the Commercial, Technology and Training director of the IAA, Philip Hughes.But he said the exact problem will not be known until an investigation is completed, and that the back up system can remain in place for as long as necessary.Mr Hughes told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that it was not a question of the equipment being old as Ireland has one of the most modern air traffic control systems in Europe.“The equipment is relatively new and well maintained and updated frequently.”He explained that the IAA has a comprehensive back up plan so that safety is maintained throughout any technical incidents. At this stage the cause of last night’s problem is still under investigation.“It could be a relatively simple problem.”Mr Hughes apologised to any people who were delayed because of the technical issue.“A handful of flights were affected in Shannon and Cork, they were all dealt with. It was relatively quiet last night. The busiest part is after midnight.”There were very few overflights (flights to and from other countries that fly over Ireland but are monitored by the IAA when in Irish air space) during the time that the radar was down, most of them are after midnight, said Mr Hughes.At all times the IAA was coordinating with other air traffic control centres in neighbouring countries where a network operates in such circumstances, he said.“It is highly rare to have this kind of problem.”The managing director of Shannon Airport says that services are back to normal this morning following Tuesday night’s problems with the flight radar system that services Shannon, Cork and Knock airports.Andrew Murphy advised the public to keep up to date on social media and to check their flight details as there will be some delays.However, he pointed out that the system being used is a back-up which is allowing a phased resumption of take-offs and landings.The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has taken all actions necessary, he said and safety was a paramount concern.He said that they became aware of the problem at 7.30pm Tuesday when informed by the high level radar centre that there was an issue with radar cover. It did not impact Dublin airport which operates a separate system.“They (IAA) kept us up to date on their back up plans.”Mr Murphy explained that four inbound flights were affected, but that after delays of one to two hours all landed safely. Two departures were also affected.This morning’s transatlantic arrivals were on schedule while UK departures were also expected to depart, however, there could be delays, he added.The airport said flights from Heathrow, Manchester and Krakow had all landed on Tuesday night. Flights had earlier been suspended because of the problems with flight radar."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3649533.1538510841!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"budget 2019 independent alliance rails against vat changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDifferent ways of changing the hospitality VAT rate have been discussed. The Independent Alliance is objecting to significant budget changes in the special hospitality VAT rate, with one member of the group warning the Cabinet increases for the entire sector could “screw businesses”. The alliance is also digging in on its insistence that pensioners should be exempt from paying property tax, despite meeting resistance from Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. Ministers were surprised when Finian McGrath, the Minister of State for Disability Issues, challenged Minister for Business Heather Humphreys on how an increase in the 9 per cent rate would affect those in her sector.Different ways of changing the tax – such as increasing it to 11.5 per cent, shy of its old 13.5 per cent level, or isolating the hotel sector for an increase – have been discussed. Minister for Transport Shane Ross is said to have maintained a silence on the issue at Cabinet. But the alliance later held its own separate pre-budget meeting, at which it was agreed that changes to VAT should be targeted at larger operators and not affect smaller businesses. One Cabinet Minister present expressed surprised at Mr McGrath’s intervention, given Budget 2019 is next week and doubt over one of its main revenue raising measures could lead to uncertainty as Mr Donohoe finalises his tax and spending plan.Those in Government circles have been anticipating the alliance having a row with Mr Donohoe in advance of budget day. Although some have been taken aback by the strength of the positions the four members – Mr Ross, Mr McGrath, John Halligan and Kevin Boxer Moran – have taken. Mr Donohoe and Fianna Fáil, whose acquiescence is needed to pass the budget, agree there is only €800 million available for new commitments. This means some taxes will have to be raised for a package of measures expected to be well over €1 billion.Separately, Mr Ross and Mr McGrath are understood to have informally approached Government colleagues and raised concern about being described as “the auld fellas’ party” because of their focus on issues affecting the elderly. They maintained this was not a fair characterisation. How will it effect you and your finances?

Photograph: Kerstin Joensson AP PhotoThe Government clashed publicly last night with the DUP over Brexit and the future of the Belfast Agreement, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejecting suggestions the agreement could be changed to accommodate Brexit.While DUP leader Arlene Foster had suggested the agreement “wasn’t sacrosanct”, Mr Varadkar told the Dáil it “is not a piece of British legislation”. “It is an international agreement between the British and Irish governments as well as a multi-party agreement among the various parties,” he said.“And certainly as far as this Government is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation in these talks over Brexit.” With reports that the UK is preparing to move its position on the legal text of the border backstop – the guarantee of no hard border in Ireland – the DUP insisted it would vote against any proposal that would result in any new barriers between the North and the rest of the UK.DUP MP Sammy Wilson warned: “We’re not bluffing.”Mrs May’s government is reliant on the DUP for its majority in the House of Commons.But as time ticks down towards a crucial EU summit in a fortnight’s time, reports of imminent British concessions in the Brexit negotiations raised tensions at the Conservative Party conference. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to British prime minister Theresa May with a call before a packed fringe meeting to “chuck Chequers”.But The  understands that the British government is preparing to accept most of the European Union’s latest proposals for the Northern Ireland backstop and to propose that the whole of the United Kingdom should effectively remain in the customs union beyond the end of 2020. Senior figures in Dublin were privately positive about the moves.However, Britain will continue to demand that the backstop should be temporary and that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have a role in approving regulatory alignment with the EU.The proposal being considered by the British government, which is expected to be presented to the EU in the next two weeks, would accept that Northern Ireland should remain in regulatory alignment with the EU for goods. Under the latest proposal from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, the regulatory control of goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would take the form of market surveillance rather than checks at ports or on vessels.British negotiators also accept the need for sanitary and phytosanitary checks on agricultural products, which would be conducted at ports and vessels as they are now. Currently, just 10 per cent of such products are checked and Britain wants the EU to drop its demand that 100 per cent should be checked after Brexit.Britain is expected to present its new proposal within the next two weeks, in advance of an EU summit on October 18th. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

The city of Paris bathed the Eiffel Tower in golden light, broadcast Aznavour’s most famous songs from the Pont d’Iéna and projected photographs of the singer on to a giant screen.Aznavour was to have accompanied President Emmanuel Macron to Yerevan, to perform for the Francophonie summit on October 11th-12th. Instead France and Armenia will hold a joint homage to the actor and singer who described himself as “100 per cent French and 100 per cent Armenian”.When Aznavour’s friend Johnny Hallyday died last December, France indulged in a similar display of affection. Like “Johnny”, Aznavour rose from a\u0026nbsphumble background to global fame. Both men were household names whose songs punctuated French life.Halliday conveyed a biker image and was marked by substance abuse, muddled marriages and squabbling heirs. Aznavour is more consensual. Though he had only a primary school education, his life and oeuvre showed great wisdom. Aznavour believed in hard work and perseverance.He projected himself into the future, speaking of projects to keep himself busy until the age of 120.Yet back in the 1950s, Aznavour told the music publisher Raoul Breton he wanted to give up. He summarised his handicaps as “No voice. No looks. No luck.” Breton told Aznavour that if the French could learn to love Louis Armstrong’s voice, they could love learn to love his too, that Aznavour should keep trying. Uncharitable remarks by critics and colleagues continued. The British called him “Aznovoice”. Sammy David jnr said Aznavour’s voice was “a waking nightmare”.Aznavour’s concert at the Alhambra concert hall in Paris on October 9th, 1958, was a turning point. He sang Je Me Voyais Déjà, about a failed singer from the provinces who imagines top billing for himself. Aznavour had written the plaintive tale for Yves Montand, who rejected it. The audience seemed cold, and Aznavour felt humiliated. He nonetheless returned to the stage to take a bow. To his surprise, the crowd rose in a standing ovation. It could have been an allegory for his career.After Aznavour’s role in Jean Cocteau’s Testament of Orpheus (1959), Cocteau said “despair wasn’t popular before him”. Aznavour starred as a piano player in love with a woman pursued by gangsters in François Truffaut’s 1963 film Shoot the Piano Player. He acted in 60 films and worked with famous directors including Volker Schlöndorff and Claude Chabrol.Aznavour’s friends, including Hallyday, Catherine Deneuve, Charles Trenet and Jean Marais, attended his premiere at the Olympia concert hall in January 1963, where he performed 11 encores. He was 39 and his singing career was finally launched.Aznavour wasn’t satisfied. “No 1 in Paris, yes,” he said. “But if I’m only 10th or 20th in New York, there’s no point ... I want the whole planet.” Later the same year, he triumphed at Carnegie Hall. “The French Frank Sinatra” succeeded in the US where other French singers failed because he made the effort to speak the Americans’ language.Johnny sang French versions of US and British hits. Aznavour imposed his songs in the US. His hit Tu t’Laisses Aller, about a failing relationship, was sung marvellously by his friend Liza Minnelli as You’ve Let Yourself Go.In his three-volume autobiography, Aznavour wrote that there was only one rule: “Work, learning. When the metro is packed, you have to push your way in. Ideas are the same. When they force themselves on you, you do the best things.”Aznavour’s life changed forever when he met Edith Piaf in 1946. She was already famous and hired him to be her secretary, driver, dogsbody and confidant. Aznavour said Piaf would not have him as her lover, unlike most of the young men who gravitated around her.Though he wrote songs for her, including Plus Bleu que Tes Yeux and Jezebel, Piaf did not believe in his talent. She knew Aznavour was self-conscious about his nose and urged him to have plastic surgery, which she paid for.Aznavour, who married three times and fathered six children, never forgot that love – whether waxing or waning – is the most basic human emotion. Countless couples have danced to the lilting melody of The Old-Fashioned Way.Maurice Chevalier said of Aznavour, “He sings of love as no one did before, with a new vocabulary which is that of the physical gestures of love ... Aznavour is the first singer who dares to sing of love as one feels, makes and suffers from it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

owners of the ­surrounding land allowed archaeologists to explore the area because they were inspired by the BBC series.The home of the Seymour family, where Henry VIII first showed an interest in his third wife, Jane, fell into ruin within 40 years of being built and was demolished, its exact location never known.Now, original features of the 16th-century property have been uncovered by a team of archaeologists and historians who have proven ­beyond doubt its true location.The discoveries were made in the grounds of the much later built Wolf Hall Manor that stands today in ­Burbage, Wilts.The findings include a network of Tudor brick sewers, several large rooms and ornate tiles that are likely to have been walked on by Henry VIII.At a glance | What did the Tudors ever do for us? Off the back of Hilary Mantel’s award-winning books and the hugely popular television adaptation, the owners of Wolf Hall allowed ­archaeologists to explore the site for the first time.Dominic Binney, who inherited Wolf Hall Manor in 2013, said: “Before the books and the BBC series we got maybe one visitor a year, if that.

Under current rules they must be paid a minimum salary of £30,000 - a figure Mr Javid hinted could be reviewed.Azad Azam, managing director of building firm\u0026nbspDPB Ltd in East London, and a member of the Federation of Master Builders, said he was stunned by the government’s stance, which currently classes all building trades as low-skilled.Robot bricklayers to be deployed in Brexit BritainThree in five UK firms say it\u0027s getting harder to find skilled staffFirms face Brexit skills shortage, forcing up wages in some sectorsImmigrants face new \u0027British values test\u0027 to become UK citizensImmigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major reportImmigration has made the UK more productive and prosperousAbbott to dismiss ‘arbitrary’ immigration targets in major speech“We have not met the house building target for 12 years in this country and that’s with free movement of workers,” he said.Four in 10 of the staff he employs are from the EU, including many from Romania and Poland.\u0026nbsp“We were shocked when we heard the plans. I thought that, with housing supposedly being a top priority, there would be an exception for construction workers.”Mr Azam says he has a contract in the pipeline to build 300 houses near Walsall but if immigration is significantly reduced he simply will not be able to fulfil it.\u0026nbsp“It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.”A number of workers he employed from Romania have already had enough of the uncertainty over their future in the UK and have left to go and work in Spain.Finding British construction workers to replace them is hard, says Azam, whose father settled in the UK in the 1960s after moving here from Pakistan.“Work that many Asians were brought over here to do, like my dad in a steelworks in Sheffield - that kind of physical labour is now being done by EU migrants. It’s frowned upon by British workers. They don’t want to do it.”He advertised for an apprentice for four months in the UK and received just three applications. One young staff member he did take on left after just one day, saying, “It wasn’t for me.”It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.To make matters worse, the visa system soon to apply to all migrant workers under the government’s proposals is a “nightmare”, and will put firms off finding the skills they need, Azam says.He recently hired two highly specialised stonemasons from India. It took him more than six months to get the relevant permits, just for a three-month project.“If that is the system for all EU migrants as well it just won’t work. By the time I apply they will have found work in other countries.”Mr Azam said that while the approach would mean the country had no chance of hitting its house-building target, he was more concerned about a drastic skills shortage in the health and social care - another area the government has pledged fix.The social care system is strained by funding cuts and an ageing population but the Nuffield Trust said the planned approach to immigration would cause further damage.Helen Buckingham, Nuffield Trust’s director of strategy, said social care providers are already turning away hundreds of thousands\u0026nbspof people who would once have been considered in need of help.\u0026nbsp“If we cut off lower paid EU workers without putting in enough money to make social care a sector people in the UK want to work in, more and more people who really need help with the everyday tasks of life will find nowhere to go,” she said.“Either we address the financial crisis that has pushed social care providers too far into the red to pay decent wages, or we continue to allow migration to fill these gaps after Brexit.”It is not only companies hiring low-skilled roles that are being hit by falling immigration.\u0026nbspTobi Schneidler, co-founder of Bouncepad, which supplies secure enclosures for iPads and tablets, said the lack of clarity around immigration had stifled hiring and that he found the government’s approach “extremely frustrating”.“Uncertainty for businesses is the most poisonous of conditions,” he said, adding that several EU citizens he knew had returned to their home countries because the “atmosphere has soured” since the referendum vote.His own experience of applying for British citizenship has also been time-consuming and costly.Despite having first moved to the UK from Germany 26 years ago, he had to pay £5,000 in legal fees, complete\u0026nbspan 80-page application form and pass the British citizenship test.“I’ve lived in the UK and paid taxes here for years, which must have been registered at HMRC, but I had to provide proof of a stable income, which entrepreneurs do not always have.\u0026nbspFemi Oluwole confronts a Brexiteer claiming the EU forces uncontrolled and harmful immigration on the United KingdomHospitality, which employs around 7 per cent of the UK workforce, is another area in which immigration policy is on a collision course with economic reality.The government has touted the sector as a potential winner from Brexit.

The company offered no further details.\u0026nbspThe discount sports giant paid £90m for the troubled high street group, picking up all its UK stores, branding and stock. Mr Ashley said he planned to keep 80 per cent of House of Fraser outlets open, and outlined ambitions to turn the brand into the “Harrods of the high street”.However, last month it emerged that stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon were set to shut, with Mr Ashley blaming “greedy landlords”\u0026nbspfor “refusing to be reasonable”. The retail tycoon, who also owns Newcastle United, has come under fire from property groups for his approach to rent negotiations with landlords. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: “What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords – a two-party process – where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can’t cry ‘unfair’ in the media when it doesn’t get what it wants.”House of Fraser stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon face closureSports Direct should hug House of Fraser customers even if it’s priceyHouse of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validMr Ashley has also faced criticism for his failure to address House of Fraser customers’ concerns, after\u0026nbspall online orders were cancelled and gift cards were made invalid. Meanwhile, a number of brands have been left out of pocket following the sale of House of Fraser, after administrators EY revealed that suppliers including Gucci, Prada and Ralph Lauren, would not be paid money owed to them, with some amounts running to millions of pounds. Mike Saul, Mulberry founder,\u0026nbspwarned that luxury brands would “think very hard” about continuing to deal with House of Fraser under its new ownership.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

Issues were particularly affecting users in northern Europe, Australia and the west coast of the US, according to the outage-tracking website Down Detector. But that is probably because of time zones – in California, where Instagram is based, it was past midnight when the problems started.Facebook hack gets worse as company admits other apps were exposed tooThe problems come amid a difficult time for Instagram. The company\u0027s two founders left in recent days amid rumours that it disagreed with Facebook over how the company should be run.And after the Facebook hack was revealed over the weekend, it emerged that Instagram users and accounts might also have been caught up in it if they had used their Facebook log-in to create their Instagram account.Some of the accounts caught up in Facebook\u0027s hacks appear to be trading on the dark web, with cyber criminals able to buy access to people\u0027s accounts for just a few dollars, according to listings seen by\u0026nbspThe Independent.It\u0027s not thought that those issues have anything to do with the current outage, which is almost certainly simply a technical fault. Instagram goes down for time-to-time and can send major ripples across the internet, since more than a billion people use it each month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance – by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way.Applications developed through Solid may have a similar function and feel to familiar apps – such as chat apps,\u0026nbspvideo-sharing sites and music players –\u0026nbsphowever there is one key difference: All data that passes through them is under the control of the user.But while the decentralised platform aims to wrest power away from\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspgiants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, the effort will need to be huge to have any kind of impact.Facebook and Google now have direct influence over nearly three quarters of all internet traffic, thanks to the vast amounts of apps and services they own that\u0026nbspincludes YouTube, WhatsApp\u0026nbspand Instagram.\u0026nbspBerners-Lee, waves as he in introduced to the audience during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games (Getty Images)To realise this vision, Berners-Lee has founded a new company called Inrupt, which will provide the necessary infrastructure to support Solid.\u0026nbspHe will also be taking a sabbatical from MIT and his other projects in order to\u0026nbspdedicate his time to Solid and Inrupt.People want to have a web they can trust. People want apps that help them do what they want and need to do – without spying on them, he wrote.Apps that don\u0027t have an ulterior motive of distracting them with propositions to buy this or that. People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance... It is going to take a lot of effort to build the new Solid platform and drive broad adoption but I think we have enough energy to take the world to a new tipping point.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On Twitter, she added: Trust me it\u0027s worth the wait.Appearing on TMZ, West himself confirmed the delay, saying that he hoped to record in Africa later in the year. “It’s just a full Ye album, and those five albums that I dropped earlier were like superhero rehabilitation,” he said, referring to the five albums he produced and released earlier in the year.ORIGINAL: Considering how sporadic and temperamental West’s current behaviour appears to be, there’s no way anyone can know for sure whether he intends on still releasing the album or scrapping it all together.Delaying the album inevitably would not be an unprecedented move for West take, for instance, Turbo Grafx 16, a record he\u0026nbsppromised to release in the summer of 2016. The album never materialised, with fans having to wait until summer 2018 for West’s\u0026nbspThe Life of Pablo follow-up –\u0026nbspthe seven-track album ye.However, Turbo Grafx 16 never had an exact release date, unlike Yandhi which also has an album cover – a clear MiniDisk with purple tape on it, reminicent of the 2013 album cover for Yeezus. Fans\u0026nbspand music critics have speculated that West has delayed the album so it doesn\u0027t\u0026nbspcompete with Lil Wayne’s new record\u0026nbspTha Carter V, although a Tweet from West contested\u0026nbspthis.The Independent has reached out to West’s representatives in a hope of getting a new release date.What have we heard of Yandhi so far?Whether any previously released tracks will actually appear on the album remains to be seen. However, West has released a couple of\u0026nbsptracks over the last few weeks, including the aforementioned Lil Pump collaboration “I Love It” and the track “XTCY”.During his Saturday Night Live appearance he also performed “We Got Love” with Teyana Taylor, a track initially meant for her album K.T.S.E,\u0026nbspwhich was produced by West and released earlier this year.There’s also a snippet of a track available on Instagram. The nearly minute-long clip came alongside a message reading: “Yandhi is releasing this Saturday”.Who will feature on Yandhi?A variety of other artists are rumoured to appear on the record, including regular collaborators Kid Cudi, 070 Shake, Ty Dolla Sign and Young Thug.Perhaps the most controversial collaborators expected to appear on the record include\u0026nbsp6ix9ine and XXXTenacion, who West says recorded vocals before his untimely death earlier this year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So it\u0027s possible that you might spot part of the Orionids\u0026nbspany time from now until 7 November.Rare electric blue clouds captured on film by NasaAnd while 21 October marks the peak of the show, the Moon might mean you\u0027re more likely to see them the week before. Around the middle of the month, it will get out of the way in the sky and make it easier for the Orionids\u0026nbspto shine through.At their peak, the Orionids could see as many as 20 of the meteors streaking across the sky. That makes it a relatively muted meteor shower compared with some of the other annual displays, but it still should be visible for the ground.And what they might lack in quantity they can make up for in quantity: the Orionids are known in particular for the brilliance of some of their lights, making them especially easy to spot.As ever, astronomers recommend heading out to somewhere with relatively little light pollution so that the night sky is more visible. Find somewhere dark and allow your eyes to adjust before looking up into the sky – wherever you\u0027d like, and with no special equipment needed at all.In keeping with their name, the meteor shower\u0026nbspwill be most visible from famous constellation of\u0026nbspOrion. But in practise, you can look just about wherever you want – and some experts recommend looking up with friends, so that you can survey the entire sky at once.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They found that a mysterious planet of the kind previously suggested — a huge Super-Earth on a very wide orbit — fit with the way that their new find was moving through the solar system.The newly discovered object is called\u0026nbsp2015 TG387, is probably a small dwarf planet at just 300km across,\u0026nbspand is incredibly far away. It is currently lying\u0026nbspabout two and a half times further away from the Sun than Pluto is.There could be many more planets like Earth than we realisedIt often reaches much further away. Its orbit takes it\u0026nbspto about 2,300 AU — that is\u0026nbsp2,300 times as far away from the sun as we are, and vastly more than the already huge\u0026nbsp34 AU that the distant Pluto sits at.At that distance,\u0026nbsp2015 TG387\u0026nbspis one of the few known objects that is so far away that its orbit is not affected by even the giant planets in our solar system like Neptune and Jupiter.These so-called Inner Oort Cloud objects like 2015 TG387, 2012 VP113, and Sedna are isolated from most of the Solar System\u0027s known mass, which makes them immensely interesting, said Sheppard. They can be used as probes to understand what is happening at the edge of our Solar System.The object is one of the strangest things that astronomers have ever spotted within our own solar system. But there could be many more of them than we have ever realised, the researchers said.We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387 out on the Solar System\u0027s fringes, but their distance makes finding them very difficult, said the University of Hawaii\u0027s David Tholen. Currently we would only detect 2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the Sun. For some 99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see.The new discovery is being announced by\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union\u0027s Minor Planet Center.

The company offered no further details.\u0026nbspThe discount sports giant paid £90m for the troubled high street group, picking up all its UK stores, branding and stock. Mr Ashley said he planned to keep 80 per cent of House of Fraser outlets open, and outlined ambitions to turn the brand into the “Harrods of the high street”.However, last month it emerged that stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon were set to shut, with Mr Ashley blaming “greedy landlords”\u0026nbspfor “refusing to be reasonable”. The retail tycoon, who also owns Newcastle United, has come under fire from property groups for his approach to rent negotiations with landlords. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: “What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords – a two-party process – where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can’t cry ‘unfair’ in the media when it doesn’t get what it wants.”House of Fraser stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon face closureSports Direct should hug House of Fraser customers even if it’s priceyHouse of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validMr Ashley has also faced criticism for his failure to address House of Fraser customers’ concerns, after\u0026nbspall online orders were cancelled and gift cards were made invalid. Meanwhile, a number of brands have been left out of pocket following the sale of House of Fraser, after administrators EY revealed that suppliers including Gucci, Prada and Ralph Lauren, would not be paid money owed to them, with some amounts running to millions of pounds. Mike Saul, Mulberry founder,\u0026nbspwarned that luxury brands would “think very hard” about continuing to deal with House of Fraser under its new ownership.

Katie Hopkins, who was given her platform on the BBC series 11 years ago,\u0026nbsplost a libel case to the food writer\u0026nbspJack Monroe last year.TV preview: ‘Wanderlust’ continues as ‘The Apprentice’ returnsMeet the 16 new candidates on The Apprentice 2018Lord Sugar doesn’t have much sympathy for her. Speaking at the launch of the 14th series at London’s Soho Hotel, he said: “She caused her problems herself, I believe. She went a step too far.“She’s made her bed, she’s going to have to lie in it. It’s one of life’s lessons that she’s learned. Maybe it might be a wake-up call for her. She’s got to solve this and then move on. There’s no advice I can give her because she made her own problems, I think. I hope she’s learned\u0026nbspfrom it.”To avoid bankruptcy, Hopkins has applied for an insolvency agreement after failing to donate\u0026nbsp£5,000 to a migrants charity, as initially requested by Monroe. Her media career is also in tatters after she was dropped by LBC\u0026nbspRadio\u0026nbspafter calling for a “final solution” following the Manchester Arena terrorist attack.Created with Sketch.The Apprentice 2018: Meet the candidates Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.He says: “There are very few people that can genuinely say they’re going to make it - but I know that I’m going to.”She says: “I am used to laying down the law in the courtroom, but now I’m going to lay down the law in the boardroom.”He says: “I know everything.

He will solve the problem by building a bridge between the UK mainland and Ireland. Mr Boris Johnson is more known for burning bridges than for building bridges!We will never undermine the principles of the European project to rescue a political party who is not even capable to find a common line on the mess of Brexit“Then there’s Mr Rees-Mogg who’s saying ‘yeah, I have the proposals for the future of Brexit, ordinary citizens and their savings can be secure after Brexit!’ and in the meantime he’s opening for himself an investment fund in Ireland, to transfer his money to Ireland.”He added: “Jeremy Hunt, who is comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union. But in his case that is not so abnormal: he has once even confused Japan with China. This is not the first time this is happening.\u0026nbsp“The previous time he was insulting his wife, but this time it’s something far more different: he’s insulting not us, but millions of ordinary citizens who have lived under Soviet rule for so long. That is in fact a point on which he has to apologise, I think, because we cannot take it as such a thing he said.”Other senior Brussels politicians also used the debate to tear into senior Conservatives. Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right European People’s Party and an ally of Angela Merkel, told MEPs that British politicians would have to start taking responsibility for their mistakes.“Brexit means leaving the European Union and this means losing the advantages of this Union. That is the simple principle behind this,” Mr Weber said.“The big challenge for the politicians in Great Britain like Hunt and Johnson is probably that after March next year they have to take over responsibility.\u0026nbsp“For the first time they have to explain to people what they did, what are the mistakes of their political engagement, and they can’t blame Brussels anymore for what is happening in Britain. That is a big change for them.”Mr Weber, a likely candidate to be the next president of the European Commission, also called for “ringfenced” protections for EU citizens living in Britain and British citizens living in the EU in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

She asserts this amongst continued attacks on her approach to Brexit by Boris Johnson and the European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees MoggQuite the blow was dealt to the Prime Minister at a EU leaders summit in Salzburg on September 20. European Council President Donald Tusk stated that the Chequers deal will not workFollowing the rejection of her Chequers plan the day before, the Prime Minister voiced her anger that the EU had dismissed it without offering an alternative. She stated that “throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said: “We want a deal. Those who think that a no-deal would be a better solution are not aware of the difficulties such a scenario would imply.”Brexit talks have been effectively frozen in Brussels while the Conservative Party conference takes places in Birmingham, owing to the instability of the British government.The EU says a deal needs to be reached in the next few weeks, before this month’s meeting of the European Council.The prime minister is however stuck between the EU and her own party, neither of which appear to have compatible views on the issues of both the Irish border and the future trade deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If others join with us on that, great.”At the same meeting, DUP\u0026nbspleader Arlene Foster fired off a stern warning to Theresa May that\u0026nbspher party could not accept a backstop arrangement that threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom.She said: We have to ensure that there is no border down the Irish Sea. We have to continue to have the integrity of our country maintained from a constitutional point of view and also from an economic point of view.We do absolutely want to see a deal that delivers for Northern Ireland and for the whole of the United Kingdom.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She

NO-DEAL BREXIT READY: UK plans HUGE tax cuts to TURBO-CHARGE economy                Boris Johnson to SHAME Theresa May at Tory party conferenceMrs May will promise that, in the coming months as the Brexit negotiations reach a climax, the Tories will always act in the national interest and put the needs of hard-working people first.Signalling her desire to dominate the centre ground, the Prime Minister will accuse Labour under hard-Left Mr Corbyn of abandoning decency in political discourse.\u0026ldquoMillions of people who have never supported our party in the past are appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour, she will say.\u0026ldquoThey want to support a party that is decent, moderate and patriotic, one that puts the national interest first, delivers on the issues they care about and is comfortable with modern Britain in all its ersity.\u0026ldquoWe must show everyone in this country that we are that party a party that conserves the best of our inheritance but is not afraid of change, a party of patriotism but not nationalism a party that believes in business but is not afraid to hold businesses to account.She will say that the Conservative Party recognises the good that government can do but knows that government will never have all the answers and believes your success in life should not be defined by who you love, your faith, the colour of your skin, who your parents were, or where you were raised \u0026ndash but by your talent and hard work.Brexit news: Theresa May will issue a patriotic speech tomorrow (Image: )Mrs May will also signal her determination to stand up for the UK, saying the Tories are a party of Unionism, not just of four proud nations, but of all our people.And mocking Labour for the many not the few slogan, the Prime Minister will say that the Tories stand not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.Mrs May last night dismissed her warning from her business minister Claire Perry that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic.She said: We are preparing for a no deal because we don\u0027t know what the outcome of the negotiations is going to be.We are all focused - as Claire is and the whole Government is - on making sure we get a good deal from the EU.If we go into a no-deal situation, there would I believe - and others have said this - be some short-term disruption.What is important is that Government puts in place measures that make sure we can make a success of Brexit, regardless of the deal we get from the EU.Brexit news: Theresa May preparing her showpiece Conservative Party Conference speech (Image: PA)And after details of her plan for post-Brexit border controls were unveiled at the conference, the Prime Minister insisted she was still committed to bringing net annual migration down to sustainable levels in the tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands.She added: It will take time to get to where we want to and - as I\u0027ve always said in the past in terms of dealing with immigration - you constantly have to be looking to make sure you\u0027ve got the rules right and people aren\u0027t abusing the system.So it will take time to get to those numbers but of course having the ability to bring control in relation to those people coming from the European Union will help in that process.In another interview, Mrs May rejected suggestions that the economic squeeze over the last decade was driving voters towards the hard-Left agenda of Mr Corbyn.No, what I did when I became Prime Minister was recognise the concerns of people in this country - concerns from some people that globalisation had left them behind, she said.Brexit news: Theresa May will deliver a showpiece speech tomorrow (Image: PA)In recognising those concerns and addressing some of those concerns, it\u0027s important that we also recognise that it\u0027s free markets, it\u0027s capitalism, it\u0027s open economies, trade around the world that have brought many of the great developments in human life.We also need to make sure that it works for everyone. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve said I\u0027m working for a country that works for everyone.She added that the Government will soon publish fresh proposals for solving the Brexit row over the Northern Irish border.We are continuing to work on that new offer and we will put a new offer before the European Commission, she said.She added: We are working on the proposal that we will put forward to the European Union on this so-called backstop.People use this phrase \u0027backstop\u0027. What it means is a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland. We committed to that in December in the joint report.I did that because people of Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom. I think it\u0027s important that we are able to deal with their needs and requirements as we do with people across the UK.This concept of introducing no changes in that regulatory environment without that consent of the people of Northern Ireland was in that December joint report.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £billion orce billwe dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning thatthe PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask mecertain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids  years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing  women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as .He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one caresyou have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £ to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PMshe did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for  years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already .% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain  Northern Ireland in .FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many were found in village temples and played a part in local folklore.Mr Risbood told the BBC: We walked thousands of kilometres. People started sending photographs to us and we even enlisted schools in our efforts to find them. We made students ask their grandparents and other village eldersthey knew about any other engravings. This provided us with a lot of valuable information.The pair found petroglphs in and around  villages, but only about five of the communities were aware that the images existed.Tejas Garge, director of the Maharashtra state archaeology department, also told the BBC: We have not found any pictures of farming activities. But the images depict hunted animals and theres detailing of animal forms. So this man knew about animals and sea creatures. That indicates he was dependent on hunting for food.All kinds of animals, including sharks, whales and turtles feature in the carvings, while human figures and geometrical designs also appear.Since the remarkable discovery, the researchers have been working to document the thousands of ancient carvings and spur efforts to preserve them.The state government has designated  million rupees to study  of the petroglyphs in greater detail, according to the BBC."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438736326.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kate middleton materinity leave visit forest school paddington rec","story":"But the Duchess of Cambridge clearly had her own children on her mind as she greeted students at the forest school in Paddington, cooing over a seven-month-old almost the same age as my little boy.The mother has been on maternity leave for five months, with her visit to Paddington Recreation Ground her first official solo event since giving birth to Prince Louis in April.And today the -year-old was inundated with young fans, left beaming as a little girl rushed forward to hug her around her waist.Kate, clearly surprised, laughed as the girl gripped her arms around her waist, and a second rushed in to make it a royal group hug.The duchess, wearing a khaki green Fjällräven jacket, a silk Joseph and Penelope Chilvers shirt, and riding boots, is today visiting Sayers Croft Forest School and Wildle Garden to see how it is helping childrens emotional and physical well-being.It was a charming start to Kates first official solo event since welcoming third child Louis into the world.The duchess made sure to speak to as many students and families as possible as she was taken around the facility -

The Prime Minister will announce yet another year of tax cuts for drivers that her Chancellor Philip Hammond admits will come at signicant cost to the nation. It comes as the Dailyreports fresh discussions have begun about when Mrs May should be oustedshe refuses to quit before the next election. Despite her dficulties shell claim Britains post-Brexit future is full of promise - urging Jeremy Corbyn voters to switch to the decent, moderate, patriotic Tories. It is the first formal spending announcement to be included the Budget in four weeks time. It will benefit hard-pressed motorists but comes as other groups continue to struggle - with working-age benefits still frozen for four years to .  Mrs May will claim the benefit of having a “little bit of money left to put away at the end of the month” isn’t “measured in pounds and pence”. She will add: It’s the joy and precious memories that a week’s holiday with the family brings. It’s the peace of mind that comes with having some savings. This years fuel duty freeze alone has cost the Treasury poundmillion. The red meat to tax cut-hungry Tory activists comes after scheming Boris Johnson savaged her Brexit blueprint as an “outrage”. He told delighted supporters it is time to “chuck Chequers”. Blasting Mrs May’s withdrawal plan again, he said: “This is not what we voted for – this is an outrage. “This is not taking back control, this is forfeiting control.” He quit the Cabinet in July so he could oppose the Chequers plan, which he said yesterday would keep Britain too closely tied to Brussels. The ex-Foreign Secretary, who has split from his we and has previously faced claims of extra-marital affairs, added: “If we cheat the electorate – and Chequers is a cheat – we will escalate the sense of mistrust.”  Activists even cheered his suggestion the PM risks being prosecuted under a th century law stating “no foreign court or government shall have jurisdiction in this country”. Mr Johnson, who chickened out of a  leadership bid after he lost the support of Environment Secretary Michael Gove, accused Mrs May of losing her nerve over quitting the EU. He said: “If we get it wrong, my friends –we bottle Brexit now – believe me, the people of this country will find it hard to forgive... “If we remain half-in half-out, we will protract this toxic, tedious business.”  At a ConservativeHome fringe event, he aimed a broadside at Mr Gove by warning against leaving the EU with a deal then hoping to sort it out afterwards – a move floated by Mr Gove. Mr Johnson told , Tory activists in Birmingham: “Do not believe that we can somehow get it wrong now and fix it later... Total fantasy.” In his -minute speech he outlined a traditional  for a leadership bid by calling for low taxes, boosting home ownership and devolving power. He laid into Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , mocked Chancellor Philip Hammond and slammed Mrs May over police stop-and-search powers. She responded by saying in an interview: “There are one or two things that Boris said that I am cross about.”  Mrs May also slapped him down by saying: “Of course, Boris, when he was Foreign Secretary, signed up to the Chequers plan and then a few days later resigned from the Cabinet.” Business minister Claire Perry said Mr Johnson “doesn’t have a policy backbone anywhere on him”. In her speech Mrs May will claim the Tories are the party of virtue. She is due to say: “Millions who have never supported our party... are appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour. They want to support a party that is decent, moderate and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first... And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its ersity. “We must show everyone in this country that we are that party.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what tory brexit going look","story":"NewsopinionThis is what the Tory Brexit is going to look likeTheres bad news for borders, badgers and BorisShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are  days until Brexit, theyve got a full tank of prats, half a pack of loons, theyre doomed and theyre wearing blue rosettes. Welcome to the Conservative Party conference of , where the Tories are trying to pretend they can organise a knees-up that doesnt somehow end in whacking themselves in the testicles.Its day one, and theyve already failed. Their Great Blond Hope has not only been victim of a Big Daddy splash by Lord Digby Jones, hes been impersonated by Phil Voldemort Hammond and had his ideas characterised as not much good by David Mine Are No Better Davis.We are now uncomfortably close to the arbitrary date for leaving the European Union, chosen by a Prime Minister who herself was chosen because she wasnt someone , and as is the way with things on horizons it looks worryingly like an out-of-control hydrogen explosion.We all know whats happened - the referendum supposed to uny the Tories has caused them to turn on each other like cannibals who gave up chlorinated chicken for Lent, the question supposed to be settled for a generation remains unanswered, and Theresa May is still PM primarily because she isnt someone .So what is Brexit going to look like, under the Tories  . Project Oh Dear Jeremy Hunt is a man who has more in common with an Anglepoise lamp than the rest of the human race. He can be pointed, turned on, and turned off again, but usually fails to illuminate anyone. He is now second-favourite to be Prime Minister next year, which should be adequate proof of just how boked the Tories are.Boris is trolling, Sajid and Gavin are manoeuvring, Chris Grayling is in a siding outside Melton Mowbray and Hunt - a man who, the Leveson Inquiry heard, tried to hide behind trees to avoid journalists while still being visible to them - is now, let me say it again, one of the favourites. Its a bit like saying the green Opal Fruit is your favourite. Or that the USSR, which invaded countries that tried to leave it and killed millions, is just like the EU, which negotiates, even with people who dont know what theyre doing. .

Boo hiss to foreigners! Elephants are British! Wait, what  . Project Is This Really The Best You Could Do  Brexit, the Tories are assuring us and their donors, will mean a bonfire of unnecessary rules and regulations about meaningless, bureaucratic tripe like child car seats, not getting killed at work and hiding your money from the taxman.It gives us a chance to set our own rules such as only banning dangerous cladding  months after it burned  people alive, and onlyits on new buildings, which means all the people living in older properties can go sizzle.It also wont matteryou sleep surrounded by highly-flammable material on the sixth floor, oryou dont have a sprinkler system, or the fire exits are blocked or non-existent. After Brexit, you wont want to live anyway. . Project Genuine Fear  The government of the UK is trying to exit a union it doesnt want while protecting one that it does. To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now,  months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.Patrick Kieltys dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime. The Tories border solution involves asking those self-same people to pretend theres a border where there isnt one, and file paperwork well in advance before smuggling guns, drugs and people across  miles of hedge that we cant police. Laugh  Youll die. . Project It All Onto Someone Else Presiding over economic chaos  Watching John Lewis go down the pan, the world turn against you, and Jacob Rees-Mogg destroying all his own suggestions by moving his investment funds to the EU and trying to get a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of Jam Jar Or Something Like That  Well, why not shoot some more badgers. Not in the head, thats too quick. Kneecap them and watch them suffer. Burn some cattle, bankrupt some farmers, blame it all on the EUs crazy rules about bovine TB which isnt harmless so long as you pasteurise your milk, mostly doesnt kill cows and could easily be stopped with a vaccineonly we could be bothered.When someone says but Brexit means we can abandon these rules! Save the badgers! point out we still have to abide by EU ruleswe want to sell beef, milk or cheese to the EU. And dont, for heavens sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, youre looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.Youll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we havent dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything  that moved because, after Brexit, theyll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past  years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

This includes “corn snacks, wheat snacks, prawn crackers, poppadums ”, the paper states.  However, a Scottish Government spokesman last night claimed poppadoms and prawn crackers would be classed as part of a main meal - despite there being no mention of any exemption in the consultation document. The spokesman said: “We’re not looking to make restrictions in relation to main meals and it is not our intention to restrict restaurants from including savoury foods, such as prawn crackers or poppadoms, as part of meals.” According to Cancer Research UK, obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking, responsible for  cases in Scotland every year.

He said: “It usually takes at least a couple of days of criticism before the Nationalists go into reverse. “The document made it quite clear that there was to be a nanny-state approach on extras like poppadoms. “To slam the brakes on when it fears bad headlines are around the corner is contemptible.” Scottish Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick said his proposals are “groundbreaking”.

Lord Sugar, who trades on his no-nonsense image, suggests some high street shops would be okay. “Touchy-feely stuff, where you need to actually go and touch and feel or eat it, I suppose has still got a le,” he says. “But our high street is made up now of coffee shops, delis and little cafes and nail bars, and all that type of stuff.”  Is he not worried our communities could become derelict unless we turn high streets around  “It’s worrying but I don’t know what the solution is,” he says. “Unless it’s some niche market like clothing or dresses or menswear or whatever that’s specialised.” Lord Sugar appears resigned to shypeople now shopping online, saying: “I mean, most people now, young ladies in particular, buy a load of their clothes online. “You have the opportunity of buying five dresses at once and sending four back just to see which one suits you more. “You’ve even got the situation where a nasty person will buy a dress online wear it to a party and send it back anyway.” Lord Sugar, whose dad started in the rag trade, warms to his theme: “On top of that you have giants like Primark and Matalan that now have not the traditional season you used to have in fashion – autumn, winter and summer – but  seasons, every week they are replenishing the store with new range. “And the cost of the merchandise is such it’s disposable. Many years ago, a young lady would buy herself a rather expensive dress in relation to her salary.  “Now she can go and buy a dress for the same price as a gin and tonic and throw it away.” This is not, it should be said, entirely on message with the Mirror’s High Street fightback campaign, which is promoting positive ways of reviving our towns and cities.

But this is proving something of a challenge, as every time she starts to speak Lord Sugar interrupts her. These cakepreneurs, explains Alana, sell her products at food festivals, country shows and markets. “Let me try and explain it,” says Lord Sugar. “You have got the ambassadors who have exclusivity for a certain area where they can sell at fairs and places like that.

Jordan Adams from Redditch, Worcestershire, has been told the chances of getting his condition are less than winning the EuroMillions and says he has been incredibly unlucky. Although he has no signs of the illness now, doctors have said he could lose the ability to walk, talk and eat for himself at any time. He has also been told his le could end in his fties, like his mum Geri, who died at the age of .  Jordan was told he would develop early onset frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson’s Disease after inheriting a gene - which caused the degenerative conditions - from his mum. Last month, doctors gave the entrepreneur the crushing news he had a rare mutation of the MAPT gene, which causes the condition. And he has been warned his health will deteriorate as he gets older. He now plans to have his sperm screened for the gene so he and girlfriend Lucy Thomas, , can start a family before his symptoms develop.  Jordan also plans to tick travelling to Hawai, buying a house, and doing a skye off a bucket list. He said: “When I was told the diagnosis I was devastated. “We had been in the waiting area for what seemed like hours – it was only  minutes but it felt like an eternity. “As soon as I walked into the room I knew it wasn’t a positive result. “Nobody can prepare you for that. “If there are no advancements then I’ll have a shorter le than most. It’s like a death sentence. “Its very hard to explain. Were all dealt cards in le and I was just incredibly unlucky.  Jordan was given the news he had tested positive for the gene when he and sister Kennedy,  decided to get themselves checked after watching mum Geri deteriorate over a period of six years. He was finally given the results on September  after three gruelling months of consultations and blood tests. Jordan said he saw the full impact of the disease while caring for Geri, as he watched her lose the ability to talk, walk and eventually eat and breathe for herself. Her family first noticed something was wrong in , when she suddenly began acting out of character. However she was not diagnosed until  and sadly passed away in . Jordan said: “Mum was full of love and very much a people person. “No one had a bad word to say about her, she was very kind and lovely. “We’d noticed irregularities in her behaviour. I remember one Saturday she went to pick up Kennedy from school but it was a weekend. “Her character changed from being a loving woman and she became quite cold. “She seemed to lack compassion which was a huge change from when she’d covered us in love. “She slowly got stripped of her communication. She couldn’t talk a lot and then she began to lose her mobility and couldn’t go out alone. “As the disease progressed she lost the ability to walk and care for herself and for the last  months she was bedridden. It was heartwrenching.”  Jordan said that despite his initial shock, he and girlfriend Lucy have discussed plans for their future together and that he feels like his diagnosis will give him a unique perspective on le. They are considering having IVF when they decide to start a family as the process will allow doctors to screen his sperm for the dementia-carrying gene. Jordan said: “I feel like the diagnosis is actually a licence to live. “It’ll make me step back and appreciate the bigger picture. It’s going to allow me to make choices to live a fulfilled le. Lucy added: “We’ve decided that it’d be probably best to have children first and then get married. “We know it’s dferent to how most people would it do but it’ll give Jordan more time with his kids. “It’s hard to deal with knowing he won’t be there one day but it’s important to retain perspective. “We will have a le together despite everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum claims deputy head told","story":"NewsMum claims deputy head told girls knee- skirts were only OK on slender pupilsEllie Porter-Smith and her friend Jasmin Stacey, both aged , have been kept off school following the ongoing row with staff at Hounsdown School in HampshireShareCommentsByLaura Forsyth:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsEllie Porter and her friend Jasmin Stacey were told their garments were too tight \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo schoolgirls have been left humiliated after their deputy head told them their knee- MS skirts were too distracting as they have curvy figures, a mum has claimed. Ellie Porter-Smith and her friend Jasmin Stacey, from Totton, Hampshire, were both threatened with detention as their garments were said to be too tight. The pair, who are both -years-old , were also advised to cover up in shin- skirts by Hounsdown School’s headteacher Julie Turvey and deputy David Veal. Both have been kept off school for  days as a result of the ongoing row. Ellies outraged mum Gemma Porter, , believes that the girls were being punished for having curves and claims that Mr Veal said the skirts would be better suited for more slender figures.  Mrs Porter said that when she got in touch with the school after the girls were spoken to about the issue last week during the new term, she was asked to buy a new skirt for the next day. AndEllie came into class with the same inappropriate garment she would face detention, despite the skirts being the same ones that the pupils had worn the term before. Following talks with school staff about the garments the mums took their teenage girls shopping with their teachers, which they say was an embarrassing experience for them. Mrs Porter has also been sent letters from the school saying that clothes that are suited for one pupil may not be suitable for another. Ellies aunt Carly Hughes, from Gosport, Hampshire, posted pictures of the two girls wearing their skirts on Facebook , which has sparked anger from other parents. Ms Hughes wrote: Apparently [my nieces] skirt is unsuitable and the school want to put her in inclusion until the situation is resolved, however her parents disagree as she is being punished for something out of her control, basically for being curvy and for skirts not fitting her body shape. School have refused to send work home for her to do and even after ious meetings with school and even a teacher accompanying them to Skoolkit where she tried on  skirts none of which fitted, the school have then gone on to order more for her to try, reaching a total of  skirts it is not only embarrassing but uncomfortable for her and making her feel fat and self conscious.  She added: I am almost certain they wouldnt be addressing the issue of a skirt thats too tight on an overweight obese child. So as a young impressionable girl, this is all kinds of wrong she is at a critical time in her last year at school when she should be studying for her exams the only thing she is learning right now is discrimination, body shaming and negative body image all of which could have a serious impact on her wellbeing and self confidence. But its ok the school have said they will offer counselling for body confidence issues when she finally s back to school, yet they have been the contributing factor to this...ridiculous! The post sparked outrage, with other parents saying the school was being unreasonable. It has since received , reactions, , comments and , shares.  Mrs Porter is said to have taken the girls shopping to school outfitters School Kit with their teachers to make sure the right skirts were purchased. However after an unsuccessful and embarrassing experience both Ellie and Jasmin’s mums bought ‘plain’ skirts from a clothes website for curvy girls. But when the girls came to school wearing the skirts they were told the small slit at the back was against the rules. Despite the mums offering to sew them up, the teachers said this would not help. Mrs Porter said that Mr Veal and his we then went shopping to Debenhams to choose more suitable skirts, which she described as horrible, shin- and way below the knee. Sixteen days after the families took their children out of school, and after trying  other skirts bought by both the parents and school, the parents decided to send them back to class. However the A-line, jersey fabric skirts which were checked by the teachers using a special blue laminated ‘skirt rule’ were deemed to be too short.

Model Kira Mayer, , claimed she was victimised behind bars with many prisoners resenting her glamorous looks.Her chest was scalded “to the bone” in the alleged attack and months after the incident she still has a “red bleeding scar,” she said. She claims she got into a row with her cellmates who expected her as a “newcomer” to clean the cell and toilet. And the social-media star is shocked by le in prison in general - and says she wants to be fed oysters and have hotel service.  Speaking of the alleged attack, Mayer said: “Its been two months now, there was a deep burn to the bone. “And here they did not even give me any special medication to treat this. “I was just sent to the punishment box. “Im not a rebel, but I was strongly against the pressure on ‘newcomers . Despite reports that she suffered facial injuries the model revealed to a human rights monitor that the serious wound was to her chest. Human rights monitor and prison visitor Eva Merkacheva - also a prominent Russian journalist - wrote: “Incredibly, she manages to look the same behind bars as she looks in her Instagram. “Long hair, and huge doll-like eyelashes.”  The prisoner, used to tropical photoshoots and exotic holidays, said: “I’m always beautulthe media visit me.” And Mayer has not let the incident prevent her from making a series of extraordinary demands from warders in her Moscow detention centre ahead of her move to a penal colony for her  month sentence. But insistence on being served oysters and deliveries from top restaurants has not gone down well. Mayer said: When they brought me some strange porridge for breakfast, I asked: Can I have a hot croissant, orange fresh, mixed omelette and cheese  “I thought it was possible to order food here like in hotel. They laughed. “Next, they have such ugly metal bowls here. I cant eat from them, I’m afraid.” She said she only eats on plastic plates delivered by her family. “I am offering to introduce a paid service for delivery from restaurants so that they can bring oysters and fish, she said. “I want oysters so badly.”  She complained: “My bed is made of metal bars. “I asked for a normal one with an orthopaedic mattress, and they laughed at me again. It also turned out phones are not allowed here. I used to have three mobile phones and was on Instagram all the time. “I askedI could get even the most basic iPhone with internet but they laughed at me even more.” Mayer pleaded guilty to assaulting a traffic police officer who stopped her driving her Mercedes without a licence on the way to a manicure in Moscow. She offered a threesome to the officer and his colleaguethey ignored her motoring offence, according to reports citing law enforcement sources. The policemen “declined her offer and detained her”, it was reported.  From her cell she admitted to Merkacheva that she was “very afraid” of jail. Later she said she “told myself I had to continue living. “Now I almost dont cry,” said Mayer, ex-girlfriend of Russian pop-singer Alexey Vorobyov. “My regular le is gone. “I was on the way to my manicure - but ended up in a detention jail.” She said: “Only now do I realise I used to live like a princess. “I spent the whole summer behind bars, its sad. “I want to go to the Seychelles. “I do breathing exercises and it makes it better. “Half of my fellow inmates didnt like me straight away for my looks. “The other half were asking me all sorts of girly questions.”  She also blamed her female judge Katerina Kirichenko for her “harsh” sentence, claiming she “did not like me”. “In our country you can go to jail simply because you annoy someone,” she said. She admitted trying to hide the fact that she had been jailed “but it leaked out”. She said: “I realised that jail might be good and will increase my popularity.” Her latest ploy is to suggest a hair selling business to her jail governor.

The image, alleged to be suspect Anatoliy Chepiga, appears to disprove Kremlin denials that he was awarded the Hero of Russia honour by Vladimir Putin .Chepiga, , unmasked as a GRU spy, is believed to be the man behind the alias of Ruslan Boshirov.Chepiga and accomplice, identied under another alias Alexander Petrov, travelled to Salisbury in March at the time Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with a deadly nerve agent . The new picture was found after Russian journalists trawled through hundreds of images showing a Wall of Heroes at the Far-Eastern Military Academy attended by the suspected poisoner.“From ious photographs it could be seen that the wall is decorated with portraits of alumni who have received the Hero of the Russian Federation award,” reported the British-based Bellingcat investigations team which has led revelations on the story .The Hero of Russia honour is the highest the Kremlin can bestow. Bellingcat said that “many photographs” discovered by Prague-based Radio Svoboda “showed a portrait at the far end of the wall that resembled Chepiga”.  But “no photograph found until today showed the last column of photos in sufficiently high resolution to be able to identy the face of the colonel.” Now an image emerged showing “the face and name of Col. Chepiga with sufficient quality to make identication possible”. The team claims that the image matches of pictures of Chepiga and those of Boshirov from CCTV cameras on his controversial visit to Britain with another suspected GRU agent using the alias Alexander Petrov.  Bellingcat concluded: “This new photo, seen against the backdrop of a mountain of additional evidence, will present a fresh challenge to Russian authorities who can no longer credibly deny — or even equivocate — that it was Colonel Chepiga who, in his own words, travelled to and back from Salisbury, and that he was furthermore the recipient of the Hero of the Russian Federation award, traditionally presented by the Russian president himself.” Initial claims that highly-decorated Chepiga and Boshirov are one man were dismissed as “nonsense” by the Russian foreign ministry. The latest finding disputes a claim by Putin’s own spokesman Dmitry Peskov that “there is no data that the Hero of the Russian Federation has been awarded to [anyone named Anatoliy Chepiga.]”  He also claimed that any similarities were coincidental and said the Kremlin would stop commenting on the matter since the claims did not have official backing in Britain. “The Kremlin’s denials rang exceedingly hollow against mounting additional evidence corroborating Bellingcat’s report that was being unearthed by media organisations and open-source investigators alike,” stated Bellingcat.  Separately, it has been claimed that Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga was the Russian intelligence officer who sprang toppled Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych to safety during the  Kiev revolution. The sensational version may explain the award by Vladimir Putin to Chepiga of the Hero of Russia award. Another claim suggests that the -year-old military intelligence officer’s we Galina - mother of his two children - has also worked as an undercover operative. These two claims come from journalist Sergey Kanev of the DoseCentre. Kanev fled Russia before making his allegations and is now “safe” in a foreign location.  Pro-Putin Yanukovych was spirited out of Ukraine in  as protesters took hold of capital city Kiev. The fallen president - renowned for his gargantuan corruption - claimed he was shot at as he fled. He was smuggled to Crimea and now lives under close guard in Russia. “Chepiga-Boshirov took part in the evacuation of Yanukovych to Russia - at least my sources claim so,” wrote Kanev. “He and his special forces unit arrived at the Yanukovych residence in Mezhyhirya . He was there, guarding . “They transported him from there to Crimea and further to Russia.” One theory is that he was taken to safety by a Russian submarine. The operation was led by former Putin bodyguard Alexey Dyumin, now governor of Tula region. Dyumin is being groomed by Putin as his choice as his Kremlin successor, claim some experts.

The tropical storm is currently strengthening in the mid-Atlantic and is expected to develop to hurricane strength by tomorrow.  Storm Leslie has dramatically veered eastwards and is on course to hit northern Europe by the end of next week. The low-pressure front has the potential to bring powerful winds and stormy conditions as schools close for Autumn half-term.

He said: “Large swells generated by Leslie will continue to affect portions of the southeastern coast of the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and most of the Greater and Lesser Antilles for another day or two. “These swells could cause le-threatening surf and rip currents.

A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “A marked front will move over the north-west through Thursday, stalling over northern and central England and Wales during Friday and Saturday. “There will be some cloudy, wet and windy weather, especially on Saturday, associated with that front. “It will finally clear to the near-continent overnight Sunday, but turning much cooler in clearance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"weather forecast cyclone leslie set","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Cyclone Leslie set to U-turn and head straight for BritainCyclone Leslie is currently causing hurricane-force winds, in the Atlantic, off the coast of BermudaShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video could-hit-uk-watch-storm-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA huge storm bringing wind and rain could hit the UKa le-threatening cyclone changes its track.

But I kept thinking about my words, they kept rolling through my head over and over that day and left me feeling like crap: let myself go. I knew I didnt look the same as I did before, but had I actually let myself go  Ten extra lbs and a messy bun would point to yes, but my heart screamed HECK TO THE NO YOU HAVE NOT, GIRLFRIEND. Im more confident now. Im more sure of myself. Im less likely to cry over a breakout, or miss out on a night with my girls because of dirty hair. Truth is, I kind of like myself now, definitely more than I did before. I wouldn’t go back to that girl with the good hair for all the skinny jeans and skinny lattes in the world.  Amy then asked why it is we continue to use the phrase let herself go and saidpeople just took a step back and thought about it all for a moment, theyd realise they hadnt let themselves go at all. There’s a good chance we’ll discover they have in fact found themselves and appreciated themselves and loved themselves and realized that who they are as a human has absolutely nothing to do with their fake eyelashes or their highlights or their giant leathery feathery earrings , and absolutely everything to do with their heart, and their mind, and their soul, she proclaimed. She ended her post by reminding other parents that they are so much more than just a pretty face. You haven’t let yourself go. Stop saying that. It’s rude. It’s derogatory, and it’s downright absurd. You haven’t let yourself go, you have simply let go of the need to look perfect all of the time, she said. Put on makeup when you can, get your hair did when you find the time, pamper yourself, take care of yourself, splurge on a new outfit and don’t you dare feel bad about it for one second — just know that none of those outside things define you. Not anymore. They aren’t you. They are things, and there is a huge dference between the two. You are more than just a pretty face.  You are a momma. You are a we. You are a sister. You are a lover. You are a fighter. You are a warrior. You are a daughter. You are a student. You are a teacher. You are a dreamer. You are a doer. You are a giver. You are a believer. You are you, and that can never be taken away from you. The emotional post has been liked over , times and shared more than  times. Many women said that they were grateful to have read it.

Whether its putting jam on a scone before the cream, or the milk in the tea before adding hot water.But when it comes to cooking a fry-up, youd think the way to do it was pretty straightforward - heat some oil in a pan and get frying. However one mum has proved theres a very dferent way to go about cooking a full English breakfast.Sonia Cheetham, , has come up with a simple and healthy way to give her family a treat before school, reports Liverpool Echo.Instead of throwing the mushrooms and bacon in a frying pan, she puts all her ingredients into a slow cooker. She says you could even cook scrambled eggs in a mug in the slow cooker the same way.The mum, from Little Fransham in Norfolk, first had the idea to do this in September, and when it worked out so successfully, she shared the hack on Facebook. Her post, in a group called Slow Cooker Wonders, has since gone viral with over , shares. Miss Cheetham said: “Using a slow cooker is so easy, Im type one diabetic so I dont like cooking with all that fat, and it gets everywhere as well so this saves your arms. The slow cooker is a much healthier way of doing things, dont add any oil or water to the pan, just a bit of butter to the mushrooms. I find that the meat, in particular the sausages, taste much better, theyre far softer and have a lot more flavour.

The figure was stated in Parliament by unication minister Cho Myoung-gyon, who said it was given to him by the intelligence services. It is the first time the south has released an estimate of the number of weapons stockpiled by Kim Jong-uns secretive state. But Mr Cho stopped short of branding North Korea a nuclear state - meaning diplomatic efforts by the government in Seoul to get Kims regime to abandon its weapons look set to continue.The North is said to have have produced around  pounds of weaponised plutonium, NBC News reports.In April Kim met his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in and the neighbours agreed to sign a peace treaty by the end of the year.  But on Saturday North Korea dramatically ruled out nuclear disarmament - saying it does not have enough trust in the US. The countrys Foreign Minister, Ri Yong ho, told the United Nations that continued sanctions on Pyongyang were deepening its mistrust in the United States. He said: Without any trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first. The Foreign Minister, representing ruler Kim Jong-uns secretive state, said North Korea had made goodwill steps, but these had not been reciprocated. It comes after US President Donald Trump praised Kim at the UN, a year on from branding him a rocket man on a suicide mission.The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped, some military facilities are already being dismantled, Trump said. I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done, Trump said. The sanctions will stay in place until denuclearisation occurs.

A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on  minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay#s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on  minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United#s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

Last year he had two games in the hotseat after Ray McKinnon was sacked and led the team back to the top of the ision via impressive victories over eventual champions St Mirren and away to Dumbarton.At the time that prompted the board to urge him to apply for the job permanently but Ellis felt he lacked the experience to take on a club of United’s size.A year on that view might have changed and, was he to succeed Csaba, he would be a popular appointment in the dressing-room.The fact he’s a leading contender is further indication of how highly he is rated by his employers. While it was hoped Csaba would be the man to lead the team back to the Premiership, for some time now the former Raith Rovers stalwart has been viewed by many within Tannadice as a future boss.That said he does face competition from others with more experience and both Neilson and McIntyre will be interested.The pair could need convincing the Tangerines can succeed.Although he’s been out of a job since ending a dficult spell in England with MK Dons in January, Neilson’s stock north of the border remains high.As head coach of Hearts for two years from , he guided the Tynecastle outfit to promotion from a Championship that included hot favourites Rangers and Edinburgh rivals Hibs.On a tight budget, he then steered them to a top-six finish and Europa League qualication in their first season back in the Premiership.McIntyre has considerable experience from his time in charge at Dunfermline, Queen of the South and Ross County, where he lted the League Cup.He’s been out of a job since being sacked by the Staggies in September last year.While it’s known both are keen to get back in management, they’ll onlyin the right circumstances.In August, McIntyre turned down the offer to succeed Paul Hartley at Falkirk. He felt the budget there would not be sufficient to mount a promotion challenge.Likewise, earlier in the summer the vacant post at St Mirren was there for the taking for Neilson.After talks with the board, the -year-old decided their expectations were unrealistic and the job wasn’t for him."},{"url":null,"title":"vandals target the same vehicle on local road three times in six weeks","story":"Vandals have targeted the same vehicle parked on a local road three times in the past six weeks.Police Scotland has issued an appeal after the vehicle, parked in Fairport Road, suffered damage to the bodywork after being scratched.A statement said: #Anyone with any information should contact Police Scotland on , quoting CR   or speak to any police officers.#Alternativelyyou have any information about the incident you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers % anonymously on    or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org.#"},{"url":null,"title":"work begins on eight units for start up companies in dundee","story":"A printing firm is hoping to reinvigorate a historic industrial estate by attracting up-and-coming businesses to its new work spaces.Work is under way on a group of eight units designed for “start-up” companies to be used as either offices, for industrial use or for storage at Dunsinane Industrial Estate.The units arNee being built by printing firm Winter and Simpson, and will be located next to the company’s own facilities.Stephen Simpson, managing director at the firm, said: “The units have been designed to be attractive to small, possibly start-up companies.“There is a dearth of small units on Dunsinane Industrial Estate.”Dunsinane was once home to firms such as Valentines and Levi’s, both of which have since closed down.However, new firms which have moved in include car sales firm Peter Vardy, which opened a branch of its showrooms on the site last year.Dundee firm DPL also moved to Dunsinane from its -year headquarters on Dock Street in .Some of Dunsinane’s other tenants include Audi and Mercedes dealerships, and wholesalers such as Plumbstore, Toolstation and Booker.Building work is also ongoing to create a retail park next to Peter Vardy.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore#s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a - victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September  when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine. The Duke’s younger brother Lord Richard Wellesley lives on the Knockdolian estate nearby. This was their maternal grandfather Douglas McConnel’s property. South Ayrshire Council will reach a decision later on whether to grant listed consent.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Mr Ung nor Miss Ung could be contacted for comment. He bought the Station Hotel eight years ago for pound, as an investment. Since then South Ayrshire Council has tried and failed to negotiate with him in an attempt to keep the rat-infested building safe. Two dangerous building notices were issued. Finally they were forced to seal off the area on public safety grounds, effectively banning longer electric trains. And such is the present danger close to the road bridge, no diesel trains have been able to head south to Maybole, Girvan, Barrhill and Stranraer. The  bed railway hotel opened for trade in  and later had a succession ofowners including Stakis, Quality and Swallow. Ghostly pictures taken inside six months ago show rows of glasses await a nice French white, candles remaining upright on tables waiting for a light and beds made-up ready for the next guest.

Strictly Come Dancing has been watched by millions across the country since  with viewers voting for their favourite celebrity to be crowned winner. But before the television dance contest took over our Saturday night evening watch, viewers got their ballroom fix from the series Come Dancing, which later reformed becoming the follow-up show we know today as Strictly. Back when the show aired on and off on the BBC from  to , it featured professional contestants and not celebrities. Doonfoot’s Janet Stirling danced on the original Come Dancing series as a member of the West of Scotland formation team. Now the dance queen is displaying her gowns at a special showcase in the Carnegie Library in Ayr for fans of the series. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet relived her dancing days. She said: “We trained twice a week - on a Thursday evening and a Sunday afternoon for two and a half to three hours. “And the whole team met up to do that. “There was  in a team all dancing in unison.  “So the men had to keep in line with each other and when the girls went out to curtsy we all did that at the same time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that millions of people were watching you. “And you didn’t want to make a mistake because in a formation team,you did, you’d stick out like a sore thumb.” When Janet started to dance she was  years old and in her teenage years she achieved her bronze, silver, gold, British Medallion and Blue Ribband medals in ballroom. She then went into formation dancing on the series when she was , under the reign of trainer Jim Graham. The Jim Graham formation team were Scottish Champions for three years and represented Scotland at the British Open Amateur Championships in Blackpool until the team disbanded when Jim emigrated to Canada. And the ballroom beauty even met her late husband through the art of dance. Janet said: “George and I were actually dancing at that same time. And that was how we met. “I was dancing with the team at the Albert Ballroom in Glasgow, which is no longer there, and he walked up and spoke to me. “It wasn’t very often you got chatted up by a man in white bow tie and tails.”  Although George never danced on TV, he was Janet’s partner when the pair competed together in amateur competitions. And she even learned a new style to compete alongside her love. She added: “I remember we were also having private lessons because he had done Ballroom and Latin American but I didn’t know anything about Latin American so we went for lessons so we could compete in the Latin American status as well.” Janet remembers nervously waiting for her team to appear on television, as the formation dancers were the last to feature. She said: “In the original Come Dancing there was a modern ballroom section, where somebody danced the Waltz or the Foxtrot or Tango. “And then there was a Latin American section and they either did the Cha Cha, Rumba or another dance. “The Jive was in the off-beat section and that got points as well. “And then the formation team were the last to go on. “Now they don’t do it that way. “But we were dancing against maybe north east England or south of England, and they were filmed in their ballroom and we were filmed in the La Cava in Glasgow. “The dresses that I wore were the team dresses but when the team was disbanded nobody said ‘give us them back’ or whatever as the trainer went to Canada.”  Now the dancer will display a few of her dresses for fans of the original series or for those with the Strictly fever. On display will also be Janet’s yellow dresswhich she wore when she danced as an amateur with husband George. “There’s a wee bit of history to that dress,” said Janet. “My formation team trainer Jim Graham was actually the Scottish Open professional champion in Ballroom. “And he and his we May competed and that was May’s dress so I bought it from her. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet added: “There’s a lot more dress than flesh in these days. “They were big and puffy and layers and layers of net and jewelled skirt. “Now when you watch it, although I enjoy it, they’ve not got much dress on! “I think I preferred it my way but I suppose that’s natural. Janet admitted Ballroom was always her favourite style of dancing, and she was sad when the Come Dancing series had come to an end. She added: “I missed it but I still enjoy watching it.” You can view Janet’s dresses at the Carnegie Library until October .

The budget for this current financial year has dipped into pound. million of reserves. Figures from March showed the council had pound. million of reserves stocked up. Auditors said using up reserves was sustainable in the short-term. However they warned the council only to reach for reserves within recommended levels. The finances were presented to the Audit and Governance Panel last Wednesday by Deloitte. Auditors said the council had strong budget setting and financial monitoring processes robust enough to achieve financial targets despite challenges. Independent councillor Alec Clark said: “Overall this report shows the good work done by the council.” He added: “I want to congratulate the team.”  He told the auditors the council is hampered in devising a long-term strategy as it relies on Scottish Government funding, which is dficult to predict. The finance strategy for  to  estimates a funding gap of between pound. million and pound. million. The report from Deloitte said: “It is imperative that detailed plans are developed to demonstrate that the required savings can be made, with the associated supporting infrastructure to be able to deliver on these.” Following a senior management reshuffle a fresh transformation plan is to be submitted at South Ayrshire. The meeting also heard one per cent of the entire budget should be subject to community engagement. The Scottish Government set a one per cent participatory budgeting target for .

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

A rare non-biting midge and several other species have since been discovered after surveys of the estate.In total, more than , species have now been recorded at the charityrsquos forest restoration site with at least  of these are priority species for conservation.These include unusual species such as the strawberry spider with several never having been recorded in the UK before, or were feared extinct in Scotland.Research also includes successfully encouraging aspen ndash a rare tree that rarely flowers or sets seeds in Scotland ndash to flower under controlled conditions, enabling it to produce seeds for propagation.Other pioneering trials include introducing a mix of spores from mushrooms when planting and growing selected trees and seedlings, to improve growth and resistance to drought, heat and pests.Doug Gilbert, Trees for Lersquos Operations Manager at Dundreggan said: ldquoThis first decade of rewilding at Dundreggan has been an inspiring success story. Thanks to hundreds of volunteers, , hectares of new forest are now growing from valley to summit.ldquoThese flourishing woodlands full of le are helping us save the Caledonian Forest ndash one of the worldrsquos magical forest habitats ndash from being lost forever. A renewed forest is being created that will benefit people and wildle for centuries to come.Other key findings during the charityrsquos recent survey season included two rare gnats whose larvae feed on fungi. One of theseis only known from four other UK sites.The otheris only known in the UK from a handful of Scottish sites and had not been seen since .The charity also found two parasitic wasps, for which there are very few Scottish records, and ndash for the first time in Scotland north of the River Tay ndash a pseudoscorpion called the knotty shining claw.A micro-moth, the small barred longhorn ndash only documented at three other locations in Scotland, and never before this far north ndash was also found during one of the volunteer Conservation Weeks.Other new species for the UK discovered on the estate have been three sawflies an aphid two aphid parasitoids, three fungus gnats and a mite.Dundreggan has also revealed the second-ever British record of a waxfly species, a golden horsefly only seen once before in Scotland since , and the juniper shieldbug, thought to be the first Highland record.Last weekend, the charityrsquos supporters and children from Invergarry Primary School attended a celebration event at the ,-acre bioersity hotspot to the west of Loch Ness.They visited Dundregganrsquos tree nursery, where they squashed rowan berries to release seeds, and also joined wildle tours to see the conservation in action."},{"url":null,"title":"philip-hammond-forecasts-post-brexit-dividend-once-deal-with-brussels-is-sealed","story":"The Chancellor in his keynote address told delegates: \"Im going to stick my neck out here today and make a prediction to you that when the Prime Minister gets a deal agreed there will be a boost to our economic growth.\"A deal idend, which we will share in line with our balanced approach between keeping taxes low, supporting public services, reducing the deficit, and investing in Britains future.\"He said that following the Labour Party conference of last week the nation faced a clear choice.\"A choice between the seductive simplicity of the brave new world of Corbyn and McDonnells populism where the narrative is all about easy answers, and our pragmatism, which is sceptical of ideologues, which starts with the real world we live in, and seeks to make it better and recognises that there are no shortcuts and no free-lunches on the road to a better Britain, that no wealth is created without work, no gain without sacrice, no reward without effort.\"Denouncing the Socialism espoused in Liverpool as a \"discredited ideology\" and branding Labour a \"backward-looking party, Mr Hammond told conference: \"We will not outbid Corbyn with short-term gimmicks that cause long-term damage. We will not outspend him with reckless borrowing, we will not promise the illusory utopia he offers because, as those who have tried it have shown time and time again, it is based on a lie and it always ends in tears.\"He explained how no one should mistake the Conservative belief in evolution over revolution for a lack of passion or commitment to change, to a paucity of values or ideals.ldquoThroughout history, Conservative governments from Peel to Disraeli to Thatcher have delivered momentous change, drawing on our values that have stood the test of time.ldquoThe importance of family and community the strength of our nation, united by history, culture and identity standing strong as a force for good in the world the insight that economic freedom goes hand in hand with political freedom and, above all, the belief in the power of enterprise as the route to unleash talent and to improve lives.ldquoThat is why we back business, declared the Chancellor. ldquoWe back business as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society and as an essential expression of our values.ldquoSo just in case anyone, anywhere, was in any doubt at all, let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business.Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Hammond threatened internet giants with a new digital services tax to ensure they paid their fair share of the cost of public services.He stressed that, with international talks stalling, Britain was ready to go it alone with a levy on the tech companies.The measure formed part of a programme to \"regenerate capitalism\" which the Chancellor said was needed to tackle the challenges of the modern world and renew the appeal of the free market to a new generation.\"The best way to tax international companies is through international agreement,\" explained Mr Hammond.\"But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own,\" he declared.The Chancellor acknowledged that many voters felt \"left behind\" by economic change and feared they would fall further behind as new technologies like articial intelligence and driverless cars made their jobs obsolete.He warned that the Tories must persuade these people that the market system could work for them or see them fall for the \"seductive simplicities\" offered by Labour.In response, John McDonnell for Labour said: ldquoThe Chancellorrsquos speech confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory Party increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day le most people experience.The Shadow Chancellor added: ldquoThe Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long outdated slogans.

Cue a couple of decisions from the Court of Session and the current administration has been left staring down the barrel of a multi-million-pound liability that should have been settled years ago.The problem is that the longer the issue has been allowed to fester the bigger that liability has become and the authority appears to be at a loss as to how to deal with it. Though council leader Susan Aitken committed in January to agreeing a settlement this year, so far nothing has been forthcoming, with the womenrsquos legal and trade union representatives accusing the council of burying its head in the sand over even the most basic of issues.Unsurprisingly, the women are irate, and those who are members of the Unison and GMB trade unions are preparing for strike action that could see key cleaning, caring and cooking services in the city grind to a halt in the coming weeks. Yet while their anger is understandable and their cause is deserving of support, the prospect of the strike is worrying precisely because of what it is designed to achieve.All industrial action has an end point in sight, whether it be to increase wages or protect existing rights, and the end point for the Glasgow strikers is to force an immediate settlement of these long-overdue claims. The problem is,Glasgow settles now it is likely to open itself up to further claims of discrimination in the future, with the perfect storm of its discredited pay structure and its obligations under pensions legislation putting any woman approaching retirement at risk.A  update to local government pension rules means that pension contributions must be paid on all equal-pay settlements. Yet because pensions are calculated based on salary, any claimant retiring before Glasgow replaces its pay scheme - something it has committed to do, but which could take years to complete - will have paid extra into the Strathclyde fund without the guarantee of receiving the correct pension in .No wonder Glasgow is baulking at the prospect of brokering a deal. Nor is it the only local authority to freeze in the face of its pension obligations, with the Herald on Sunday revealing at the weekend that councils across the country are playing fast and loose with the pensions legislation, to the degree that some are complying with it while some are merely thinking about it and others are ignoring it altogether.The end result is that women are being discriminated against simply because of the area they chose to live and work in, with an equal-pay cleaner in Dumfries and Galloway getting her pension rerated long before the law was changed to say that was her right while her counterpart in Argyll  Bute has effectively been told to whistle.And so, while some councils grapple with what should be a simple concept, the women who help keep this country going with their daily graft are being left to suffer the consequences. Indeed, while it seems clear that Glasgow City Council has neither the means nor the wherewithal to give its equal-pay women what they deserve, the scatter-gun approach councils in general are taking to observing their pension obligations is creating yet another layer of inequality. The fact that that layer lies between the very women that were discriminated against in the first place is beyond ironic - and beyond unacceptable.Which is why, far from taking their strike to the streets of Glasgow, the cityrsquos workers should be leading women from every part of the country in a march to the gates of Holyrood to demand the Scottish Government intervenes. Councils have had long enough to tinker around the edges of equal pay it is time a higher power took control to ensure unorm justice for all.Such action would likely be a success, too,recent history is anything to go by. Indeed, just last year First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cut short an official engagement in Germany to come to the aid of the male workers of troubled engineering firm BiFab after they took the fight for their livelihoods to the streets of Edinburgh. The Government handed over a total of pound million and helped broker the buyout of BiFab by Canadian firm JV Driver, even though the dire straits the business had been floundering in meant practically all the workers went on to lose their jobs anyway.Buthundreds of boiler-suited men marching on parliament can prompt such a reaction, just think what thousands of tabard-wearing women could achieve. Who knows, they might even be able to force the Government to sort this whole mess out in time for the th anniversary of the  Equal Pay Act. And wouldnrsquot that be something "},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-urges-snp-to-take-indyref2-off-the-table","story":"Scottish Secretary David Mundell has urged the SNP to take a second independence referendum \"off the table\".Mr Mundell, speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to snap out of her \"constitutional Groundhog Day\" and get on with the day job of running Scotland.The Cabinet minister also criticised Jeremy Corbyn for his decision not to rule out another independence vote.The Labour leader previously said he was \"not ruling out\" giving consent for a second referendum and he would decide on the issue \"at the time\".Mr Mundell said: \"Every day that Scotland is stuck in a constitutional Groundhog Day is a day that our economy is being held back and that the SNP Government is not getting on with the day job of managing our schools and hospitals.\"So I want to use this opportunity to say to Sturgeon, it is time to end the constitutional uncertainty that we have lived with for the past four years.\"It is time for Scotlands two governments to work together in the best interests of the Scottish people.

He said: ldquoIn my view, a hard Brexit would represent the most unhinged example of national self-sabotage in living memory ndash and everyone in public le has a duty, a moral obligation, to do what we can to prevent it.ldquoAny politician refusing to try ndash who wonrsquot even attempt to soften the pain of Brexit by making the case for single market membership which all logic tells them is the right thing to do ndash is guilty of a serious dereliction of duty.ldquoAndtheir failure of leadership sets our economy and our society back for generations, history will judge them very harshly indeed.Glasgow City Council has commissioned analysis from Strathclyde Universityrsquos Fraser of Allander Institute showing that some , jobs in the city region depend on EU links.Sir Anton has been advising the Scottish Government on Brexit and cited figures showing that the worst case scenario leaving the EU could cost Scotland more than  billion in lost economic growth. Economists call this a ldquoheadwind, a drag on the economy whether it is growing or shrinking. ldquoWe simply cannot allow this to happen, he said. Sir Anton believes there is now a ldquo- per cent chance of a clf edge, no deal Brexit.The economist, like many others had been dismissed as a scaremonger. Now, he said, Project Fear had become ldquoProject Fact. Theresa Mayrsquos Chequers deal - her compromise offer to the EU hated by Tory Eurosceptics - was ldquodead.Lord John Kerr, the former UK diplomat who drafted the now infamous ldquoArticle  - the technical means by which Britain looks set to leave the EU - agreed Mrs Mayrsquos plan was lost.But he told the same conference that it was not too late for the UK to change its mind. ldquoLegally, we have not burnt our boats yet, he said.Glasgow-educated Lord Kerr is campaigning for a second referendum on the EU and believes article  - due to end the UKrsquos membership of the EU next spring - can be put on hold pending such a vote.The politics around a ldquoPeoplersquos Vote remains complex with both main UK parties split. Lord Kerr warned that a ldquoheavy responsibility would fall on the third party in Westminster, the SNP, to help get any such second referendum through the Commons."},{"url":null,"title":"supporters-welcome-rethink-over-hampden-semi-finals","story":"Describing the controversial plans as ldquoa shambles and ldquoridiculous, supportersrsquo groups from the teams involved in the League Cup games described the decision by the SPFL to look to move one of the matches as common sense.Aberdeen fans, who faced arriving in Glasgow after the midday kick-off due train scheduling, also said they now hoped that their match against Rangers would be moved to allow fans more time to travel.Chris Strachan, of the Aberdeen fansrsquo group Blazing Lambs, said: ldquoHopefully now they have seen sense and listened to the fans and realised that these fixtures simply should never have been allowed.ldquoHow they ever thought that it was acceptable to host the two matches at the same venue on the same day is unbelievable.ldquoI hope they now move the Aberdeen match to later in the day to allow fans time to travel to the match.Derek Ledingham, of the Aberdeen Granite City supporters club, added that the original scheduling of the semi-finals was ldquojust asking for trouble.He said: ldquoThere was the potential for four dferent sets of supporters to meet at the train station or around the city and it just takes one or two idiots to start trouble.The two matches were scheduled to take place on October  - the Aberdeen-Rangers match at midday and the Celtic-Hearts match at .pm.However, the SPFL released a statement on Tuesday saying it was now looking to move one of the matches to another venue.Joe OrsquoRourke, general secretary of Celtic Supporters Association, welcomed the decision, saying: ldquoThe whole thing has been a shambles.ldquoThere were big issues with transport - especially for Aberdeen and Hearts, but also for Celtic and Rangers fans trying to move around the city with that many people.ldquoThere were also issues with safety having four sets of fans in the city on the one day, as well as concerns over the state of the pitch for the second match.ldquoIt was always going to be a struggle, surely now they will reschedule one of the matches or move it to Murrayfield.ldquoThat seems to be the sensible way forward, but that also throws up problems for fans who have already booked transport or accommodation.The Rangers Supporters Association described the plan to host the two games at Hampden as ldquoridiculous, warning of the problems with transport around the stadium.General Secretary Claire Wallace said: ldquoTrying to get away from Hampden is dficult at the best of times.

September has a high rate of babies being born.ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

My organisation, Walking to Save Dogs, raises funds to support carefully selected local shelters and projects that rescue dogs from these Festivals and the meat trade.ldquoThe ultimate goal is to put an end to the dog-meat trade through education that dogs are sentient beings, changing legislation, and providing dog-meat traders with alternative means to support their families.Robert aims to reach John OrsquoGroats by September , although he has already lost one of his canine companions.He added: ldquoSadly, Madeleine recently developed an eye problem so has gracefully pawed out.ldquoShe continues to support the rest of the pack from a comfy armchair at home.ldquoMy pets are the voice of millions of less fortunate dogs.ldquoThey have been well-prepared for this task and they love the outdoors.ldquoWe have been walking  miles a day on average and hope to finish our walk within a couple of weeks.ldquoI am touched beyond words at the kindness and generosity of the Scottish people I have met along the trail and look forward to meeting lots more on the way to John OrsquoGroats.To follow Robertrsquos progress and to donate, go to: www.walkingtosavedogs or www.justgiving crowdfunding walkingtosavedogsWednesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117727.jpg","title":"Grand Tour takes Paul to Altnabreac and Kildonan","story":"TV presenter Paul Murton makes his way to Caithness and Sutherland in next weeks edition of his current series, Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs.During the course of the half-hour programme Paul heads to one of Britains remotest railway stations, Altnabreac.

This places Orkney third nationwide in terms of the highest empty property rates — behind Shetland and Western Isles specically.Councillor Rob Crichton, chair of the council#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: #Empty homes represent a signicant drain on rural communities, affecting their ability to rejuvenate and grow.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said pound, in total would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotWednesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar  was incomplete and that some ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar .Mr Black offered an apology for the auditrsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and itrsquos costing us a lot of money. That canrsquot be changed unless wersquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: ldquoThe councilrsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. Itrsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive yearrsquo is cold comfort.

Essentially, both need to have sustainable ways of making a living to avoid the young people moving away, and ensure that the unique culture survives, Gavin says.ldquoWhat I will be looking at in the talk, as well as giving an insight into le amongst the turquoise lakes and snow-capped peaks, is how Nomadic Skies Expeditions will attempt to test a whole new form of tourism that will benefit these remote cultures.ldquoHow can we prevent the negative and unintended consequences of tourism and make sure the local benefits are maximised  I am sure people will have their own views, from the Scottish perspective and it will be good to hear them.ldquoPeople will also be given the opportunity to be part of the journey with us.The talk will take place in the Gale Centre in Gairloch next Thursday, October  at .pm.For more details about Mr Andersonrsquos tours visit www.nomadicskiesThe  day expeditions start and finish in Kathmandu and typically feature no more than eight to  people, accompanied by Mr Anderson and a local Nepalese guide.

The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £.

He could not understand why locals should not be able to access the pool facilities at this time.He said: \"I work with sustainable tourism myself. This does not sound like sustainable tourism to me. In my opinion tourism should benefit local communities. The best reason to have tourism in the first place is so that it can benefit local residents in a dferent way.\"It can increase services locally, create job opportunities and more vibrant communities. To me it is almost impossible to imagine that we should have a situation like this happening here.\"David Butterworth, chief executive of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, told the Strathy: \"In smaller rural communities you have to have facilities like this shared with the local population.\"I think in many instances local authorities when giving planning permissions for ventures like this have a condition in there that the facilities must be made available to local people.\"That to me seems the right thing to do. If Macdonald Hotels have come up with a reason not to do that then it has to be pretty good reason to change it.\"Its a nonsense.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinleyI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead EnnisThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday th, September. Thousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.Sinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. “Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. “The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit.

Such a move would require their MPs to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning British monarch.Deputy Martin made the remarks after he was asked about the possibility of Fianna Fáil merging with the Social Democratic and Labour Partyto contest elections north of the border.Speaking to reporters in Malahide, Martin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.Before taking a seat in Wesminster, successful MPs must swear either an oath of allegiance or a solemn affirmation to “be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors”.In February, Fianna Fáil held an event to honour Constance Markievicz who  years previously became the first woman MP when she was elected to Westminster as the Sinn Féin MP for the St Patrick’s ward of Dublin. She refused to take her seat and instead sat in the First Dáil.Sinn Féin MPs in the North continue to stand on an abstentionist ticket.Responding to criticism from other Fianna Fáil TDs over their continued policy of abstentionism, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said in March :“We are not British MPs, we are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046550.jpg--.jpg?1537864027000\n","title":"ballymena rockers out to spread some joy","story":"A new rocking phenomenon is taking Ballymena by storm in the form of finding and creating little painted rocks hid around the town.Ballymena Rocks was born out of an idea by local woman Doreen Armstrong who became involved with Rocks NI after finding little painted rocks around Portrush and enquiring what their purpose was.The idea is that people paint rocks with colour and add some words of inspiration and then hide or leave them around public places such as parks or town centres to bring a smile to the person who finds them with the Ballymena Rocks Facebook page already having over  members, all creating, hiding and finding rocks around the town.Doreen was keen to bring the practice to Ballymena after having great fun finding and creating her own rocks over the Summer in Portrush. Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.Its a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.The craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others. Rocks dont have to be hid, they can be left visible.There is no particular theme to the rocks, just bright colours and whatever little saying or phrase or words of wisdom that youd like to share.If you find a rock you are able to keep it or  move it for someone  to find.Doreen is keen for more rocks to appear. She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!“Some people put our Facebook link Ballymena Rocks on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.The more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!There certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.Doreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.In Ballymena the most likely places to find a rock is at the Peoples Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.Dont forget to upload a picture of a rockyou find one.Doreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.Cmon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while youre doing it!

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice. However, it has been delivered through genuine commitment and a willingness to challenge the deep rooted, often unquestioned, attitudes, values and practices which can and do discriminate against some children and families. “It is not about ‘treating all children the same’. Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"A spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.The church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.   The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.   Minister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd “You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”Of the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm.Sad passing of Molly Lutton Shoppers urged to continue to show support for Belfast city centre retailers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

The installation of new seating, lighting and landscaping along the route will help make the trail accessible to all.It has been a goal for many years to connect all council owned open space along the river and this latest set of works is the final piece of the jigsaw which has been made possible thanks to £, funding secured from SOARVillage Renewal Measure.During the course of the works some disruption to the area may be necessary including the temporary closure of the footbridge at Gilford Community Centre and certain access points to the park.

The centre has been part of the Upper Springfield since  but it has changed and developed since then. I came onboard around two years ago and the centre is really about addressing the physical and mental health needs of the area.”The Healthy Living Centre is one of many successful projects managed by the Upper Springfield Development Trustwith physical activity classes including boxercise, zumba, pilates and circuit classes running in Corpus Christi parish church hall throughout the week. “We are open to what people want to do,” added Rosie, “we have an extremely popular Couch to K initiative and we have armchair aerobics as well for those less abled.“We also offer a counselling service here, the space here is really utilised. We run a social ‘prescribing programme’ which is a popular concept offered by your GP so that instead of prescribing medication, for say anxiety or in some cases depression, they may refer you to your local healthy living centre and that is where we come in.“Our activities have been proven in many cases to have improved the mental health of a person in that they can talk on how the centre has improved their lives.”Rosie spoke of how community engagement has increased at the Whiterock community gardens and allotment site.“We do hope to see the Men’s Shed model on the gardens, it would be another development that would address a particular need as older men as a group can become socially isolated.“We have weekly walking groups that go up the Black Mountain, Cave Hill, Bog Meadows and our cycling group is also up and running. There is great scope.”Looking ahead to the autumn and winter months, Rosie said that the centre will be encouraging parents and carers to participate in their Health Promoting Homes programme which is “trying to change mindsets in terms of healthy living, which incorporates nutrition.”“The programme is all about promoting the home as a healthier place for the children who are living with parents or grandparents,” she went on.“People are realising the connection between good physical activity, good diet and the impact that it has on their own health.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning. Customer services staff were on hand to deal with any passenger queries and  indeed any passengers with feedback or complaints we would ask them to contact the airport directly so that we may resolve their issues.\"Dont forget to arrive at least  hours before your flight and that carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security.

He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said.\"I just couldnt understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit did dup mp say build irish border as high as you like","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

He said that, sadly, he was \"not surprised\" by Mrs Fosters rhetoric. \"Even when she was First Minister she was never really in tune with the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement, which seek to create equality of le here in the north of Ireland,\" he said. In the interview, Mrs Foster praised Boris Johnsons \"positive\" Brexit vision and said it was wrong to think the Good Friday Agreement was sacred when determining any final deal with the EU.She also said it was \"deeply frustrating\" to hear people suggest that \"we cant touch\" the  accord which has been held up as \"a sacrosanct piece of legislation\" by those who have misinterpreted it. Mr Mallon urged Mrs Foster to think beyond the political terrain which her party currently finds itself on, which will inevitably sht.\"Let me just say this to Mrs FosterI may: this agreement you have with the Tory Government is transient and will pass away, but the foundations upon which the Good Friday Agreement was built will last,\" he said.\"Those foundations of peace, justice and equality is something you should think about.\" In a stinging critique, Mr Mallon said her words only bolster his belief that she \"finds great dficulty with all of the principles\" which underline the Agreement. Mrs Fosters comments also provoked criticism from Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Ms McDonald called on the Irish Government to make it clear the Good Friday Agreement was \"not a chip to be bargained\".She warned that Mrs Fosters comments \"revealed a reckless disregard\" for the peace process, which was endorsed by the vast majority of people on both sides of the border in the  referendum. \"It should be remembered that Arlene Foster left the UUP, which supported the Good Friday Agreement, to join the anti-Agreement DUP,\" she added.\"It appears the DUP leader has learnt nothing over the past  years.\"Ms McDonald also claimed Brexit was \"incompatible\" with the Good Friday Agreement and called on the DUP to \"commit to the full implementation of the Good Friday, and other agreements, rather than seeking to undermine them\", which she said would lead to the restoration of devolution. Addressing the Dail, Mr Varadkar said that while it was factually correct to say the Agreement could be changed, he sees Dublins role as \"co-defenders\" of an international agreement and vowed to protect its \"primacy\". \"I dont think we should forgot all that has been gained by the Agreement,\" he said. \"A peace in Britain and Ireland, power-sharing most of the time in Northern Ireland, and ever closer co-operation between north and south.\"Mr Varadkar added the peace deal \"is not a piece of British legislation it is an international agreement between the British and Irish Governments, as well as a multi-party agreement among the ious parties\".\"While it may be factually correct to say that the Good Friday Agreement, just like any international treaty, could be changed, it can only be changed with the agreement of British and Irish Governments, and can only be changed with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, and indeed across cross-community consent.\"It is not something that can be changed by any one political party or by any one government.\"Certainly, as far as this government is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation in these talks over Brexit.\" Tanaiste Simon Coveney took to social media to rebuke Mrs Foster, who addressed delegates attending a DUP fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham yesterday. \"I have respect for Arlene, but she is wrong on this,\" he wrote on Twitter. He too vowed to defend and protect the Agreement. UUP leader Robin Swann branded Mrs Fosters comments as \"strategically short-sighted\" and said the principle of consent \"should be sacrosanct\" to all unionists. \"The reality is that the principle of consent is what binds us to the United Kingdom, it is the best settlement for unionists,\" he said. \"We should be looking to build on this principle and ultimately remove the changes made at St Andrews to finally do away with the sectarian politics which continues to plague us to this day.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long called on Mrs Foster to clary her comments and pointed out that there is \"a world of dference\" between reforming structures with the consent of the population \"and undermining the spirit of the GFA\" against the wishes of the electorate.She also warned that a \"headlong rush\" towards a hard Brexit could render the founding principles of co-operation and interdependence as collateral damage. \"Its success relies on every one of us, including Arlene Foster, showing it the respect it deserves and understanding how signicant it is in building towards the united community we all desire,\" she added. But yesterday Mrs Foster said the Agreement is not infallible and has already been \"changed on a number of occasions\" citing the St Andrews Agreement and Stormont House Agreement as examples. \"It is a thing of its time and changeable,\" she added."},{"url":null,"title":"good friday agreement not up for renegotiation says leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Des Stewart, chairman of the Ulster Grand Prix Supporters Club, said a groundswell of opposition to the -acre site had united fans, race promoters and residents, and prompted more than , letters of objection, which were handed to the council in .\"Race fans far and wide felt so strongly about the impact these plans could have on this international event that they launched a Dont Bury the UGP petition, which has been supported by motorcycle fans around the world,\" he said.It was estimated that the lespan of the cemetery would be  years and would require an initial investment of £m. The proposed site would also include funeral facilities, catering, parking, woodland walkways and a memorial garden.But Mr Stewart had warned that the economic impact on the Ulster Grand Prix - which attracts tens of thousands of international visitors and generates millions of pounds to the local economy - would be signicant.The local authoritys planning committee agreed that the economic benefits of the cemetery would be limited following the construction phase, which they considered to be excessive and unacceptable.Councillor James Tinsley said: \"From day one local residents told the applicant in no uncertain terms that the proposal was not acceptable to them, due to the unsuitability of the site, road infrastructure, the areas propensity for inclement weather and the harm it would cause to the local area and community.\"Noel Johnston, UGP Clerk of the Course, also welcomed the rejection. However, the company behind the proposal, Carston, expressed its disappointment that \"there is apparently no need\" for the cemeteries, and pointed out that pressure is growing on existing burial plots.\"It is well known that there is no available land within the Belfast City Council area for a cemetery mainly due to underlying geological conditions,\" a Carston spokesperson said. \"In west Belfast, we understand there are less than , plots remaining in Milltown cemetery and virtually none where in that locality. \"Funeral directors have expressed concern about the lack of affordable burial provision.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.Senior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.During the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Irelandpresented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.Local authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent  to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.In addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.Since March last year, the local authorityrsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy.The current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.However, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8724270.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I’m pleased, obviously, to be working in the victims’ and survivors’ sector. “It is a huge opportunity but there is also a huge need to support families and iniduals from a security force background, from a military service background, and innocent civilians through the Troubles.”During his career as an MLA, Mr Kennedy had campaigned on behalf of Troubles victims but he stressed that his new role was not political.“Those are issues that I would have campaigned on,yes, but this is a non-political role. It is a matter of providing services and support to families and iniduals.”Reflecting on his experience of signing up for unemployment benefits for the first time in his le after losing his Newry and Armagh seat in the Assembly elections of June last year, Mr Kennedy said: “It was the first time in my le doing that and, in many ways, it was a chastening experience. “But that’s not an uncommon experience for a great many people.”He added: “That’s le, but I’m opening a new chapter with this new post and I look forward to making a contribution.”The Ely Centre is pleased to have appointed the former Stormont minister.Lee McDowell, from the centre, said: “The Ely Centre are delighted to have appointed such an experienced and local inidual to lead the development of this new outreach project.

First, there is what we might call the #Celtic Sea border# between Ireland and the rest of the EU. Ireland is in a common travel area with the UK and is not in the Schengen area, so there are in principle passport checks between Ireland and the rest of the EU at the Celtic Sea border. Second, there is what we might call the ‘Irish Sea border’, between Great Britain and the island of Ireland. There are currently controls on the importation of live animals into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.   Andrew Lilico, Executive Director and Principal of Europe Economics and the Chairman of Economists for Britain during the referendum campaign. Undated picture taken June  from the Europe Economics website Third, there is the ‘North-South’ border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, including some  crossing points. This borderis controlled via a combination of administrative cooperation, whistle-blowing, auditing, site raids by customs, tax and regulatory enforcement officials, occasional random spot-checks on roads leading up to and at the border , and cameras and other physical infrastructure at the border .Once the UK leaves the EU, under all scenarios — whether there is a deal or no deal, and whether any deal includes a customs union or not — all three of these borders will continue. The question of the Brexit trade negotiations is how many additional controls will be required , and the question of the Irish border negotiations is how, and in what balance between the three already-extant borders, any such additional controls will be implemented.It is of particular interest, therefore, to ponder what might happen at these three borders in the event of no deal. Some UK press discussion suggests that the EU would impose stop-and-check controls at the border, akin to those at the border between the EU and Turkey. The EU could choose to attempt to do that, but that seems highly unlikely because of the sheer scale of the task , because the Irish government claims it has been given undertakings by the EU that no such controls would be introduced, and because Ireland seems unlikely to be willing to allow such controls to be imposed eventhe EU sought to introduce them.Instead, in the event of no deal a much more plausible scenario would be: The EU would add additional stop-and-check controls at the Celtic Sea border, including tarf enforcement, rules of origin enforcement and regulatory compliance checks. This would ensure that any materials entering the rest of the EU from Ireland were compliant, reducing the task of North-South border controls to those necessary and proportionate for goods destined for Ireland itself. In a no-deal scenario, we should probably assume the Celtic Sea border checks would be one-way — i.e. the EU would not be checking that product was not coming from, say, Italy or Bulgaria, that was intended to enter the UK but was not compliant with UK regulations or tarf controls.In no deal, the UK would presumably considerably increase its number of customs officials in Northern Ireland, making ious random checks in factories and shops, auditing heavily and gathering intelligence so as to anticipate and intercept any smugglers, including potentially at the north-south border itself . The Irish government would presumably need to act similarly.The Irish government and the Stormont assembly might chooseto coordinate certain key regulations so as to balance the number of checks required at the Celtic Sea or Irish Sea borders and to obviate the need for any such controls at the North-South border. Unionists should not and would not object to Irish Sea border regulatory checksthose were purely the result of the Northern Ireland assembly itself choosing to make its regulations dferent from those in GB.Once we grasp that this is how the Irish border would work in the event of no deal, we can ponder how to improve it. First, an agreement to eliminate tarfs would reduce the need for tarf enforcement . Second, in the event of no deal there would be collaboration between the EU and UK enforcement authorities, so presumably as well as checking compliance on products leaving Ireland at the Celtic Sea border, EU officials, with UK officials working with them, could check products entering Ireland at the Celtic Sea border that were intended to pass through into the UK. Similarly, EU and UK officials could work together at the Irish Sea border to check products entering Northern Ireland that were intended to pass on into the EU.Third, in the event of a deal it seems likely that there would be more appetite both to grant powers to the Northern Ireland assembly to have autonomy over relevant regulations and to exercise those powers so as to sht some regulatory checks from the Celtic Sea border to the Irish Sea border. Provided that the precise extent of such a sht was flexible over time and was the choice of the Northern Ireland assembly, rather than being specied and fixed in detail in a Treaty, such an arrangement should be acceptable to Unionists and Leavers and in periods of both good will and reasonably similar attitudes to and goals of regulation, quite signicant proportions of Celtic Sea border checks might move to the Irish Sea border. In other periodsand in particular sectorsthe balance might sht back more to the Celtic Sea border.Fourth, with a deal UK and Irish customs and regulatory enforcement officials could collaborate closely, with Irish officials permitted to do raids and spot-checks on UK sitesand vice versa.Such an arrangement would allow the focus of “maximum facilitation” administrative and intelligence-based checks to be solely on the island of Ireland. That would be more practical than the need for UK and EU officials to check and raid potential smugglers across the entire EU.Legacy Scandal: ‘London and Dublin must not let IRA snatch victory from jaws of defeat,’ says Ruth Dudley Edwards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The above proposal could work, it could be designed so as to be acceptable to unionists and Leavers, and it could be an improvement in terms of EU Single Market integrity and the integration of Ireland into the EU Single Market on what would happen in the event of no deal.It now remains to be seen whether the EU would be willing to accept such a proposal in advance of no deal, or whether it would need to see what new post-Brexit reality emerged at the Irish border in the event of no deal before it saw the advantages of the scheme. Either way, I believe this is clearly the way forward.Dr Andrew Lilico is executive director of the consultancy Europe Economics, and lead economist for Leave campaignJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8655155.1538553690!/image/image.jpg","title":"man wanted by rhi inquiry has left northern ireland  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+          TriggerPrompt url  http:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude +url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Man wanted by RHI Inquiry has left Northern Ireland   Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Sam McBrideEmail Published::Wednesday  October Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valA potentially important witness who alerted others to looming RHI cost controls in  left Northern Ireland about a year ago, the RHI Inquiry has been told.Fergal Hegarty, business development manager at major renewable energy company Alternative Heat Ltd, is on the other side of the world in Australia and is not due toto Northern Ireland until the end of this year or the start of next year.   Connel McMullan, pictured at the inquiry, is Fergal Hegartys boss The RHI Inquiry is due to be finished by that stage.Yesterday a lawyer told Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry that it had not even obtained a witness statement from Mr Hegarty.He was first named publicly in relation to the RHI scandal in January  by the News Letter after this newspaper received leaked emails showing that he had disseminated information which he received from civil servants to others in the renewables industry.The emails from mid-summer , the point where the scheme was running out of control, show that the industry had advance warning of looming cost controls – a factor which enabled more people to pile into the uncapped ‘cash for ash’ scheme.Before publishing details of the contact, the News Letter repeatedly sought to contact Mr Hegarty by phone and email, but he did not respond.Yesterday his situation arose in questions to his boss.Connel McMullan, a director of Alternative Heat, yesterday gave evidence to the inquiry.Senior counsel to the inquiry David Scoffield QC put it to him: “A lot of the emails that we’ve seen from your company involve Mr Hegarty some of them involve you.“Mr Hegarty would have been someone that the inquiry was interested in getting evidence from. Our understanding is that he has been out of the country for most of the last year, year and a half, travelling. Is that right ”Mr McMullan said: “Yes, he’s on a sabbatical travelling around the world.”Mr Scoffield asked: “Is he being paid by your company while he’s away ”Legacy Scandal: ‘London and Dublin must not let IRA snatch victory from jaws of defeat,’ says Ruth Dudley Edwards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr McMullan said that he was not being paid and was “on leave”.Mr Scoffield said: “On the basis that he has been away, we haven’t been able to get evidence from him directly, which is one of the reasons that I’m asking you about some of the emails that he’s sent. Was his sabbatical in any way related to this inquiry or the possibility that he might be asked to give evidence ”Mr McMullan said: “Not in my understanding, no.”When askedhe had discussed that with Mr Hegarty, Mr McMullan said: “Em. It’s not something that I’ve discussed with him, no. Em, he is aware of the inquiry and aware of the media stigma that runs with that but he is also well aware of his position and where we stand as a company so I don’t believe it would have any bearing on any decision he would make on that front.”Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin askedMr Hegarty’s expenses were being paid during his absence from Northern Ireland. Mr McMullan said: “No.”He added that his job was being retained and “he is set to[at the] end of this year, start of next year, I believe – that’s where he was hoping to be back so, yeah, he’s a year out basically...”Mr Scoffield said that the inquiry did not even have a written statement from Mr Hegarty, despite attempting to contact him through his company.In one of Mr Hegarty’s emails which the inquiry has compelled his company to release, he referred to “the fact that the poultry industry is exploiting the scheme”. Mr McMullan said that he did not have evidence of the scheme being abused in the poultry industry.Mr McMullan said that his company “did supply every email that we had on the system that was in relation to him”.Mr Scoffield said that it seemed that whatever information was being provided to Mr Hegarty by civil servants was being written down in emails and “sent out quite openly”.Mr McMullan said that Mr Hegary was “very good at his job”.Although his company had received advance notice through Mr Hegarty that RHI was to be made less lucrative in , Mr McMullan said that he had not realised until “early February”  that the scheme was to be shut completely.However, in one of several questions which only Mr Hegarty can answer, the inquiry was told that an email from Mr Hegarty showed that the previous month he was aware that the scheme was likely to be closing and was asking civil servants to send him details of what would be happening.Mr McMullan said he did not know how Mr Hegarty knew that the scheme was likely to be closing and then told the inquiry “I can find out”.Sir Patrick asked him: “How can you find out ”The witness said: “Well I can ask him I can ask Fergal.”Sir Patrick said: “So you’re in touch with him, are you ”Mr McMullan said: “Aye, yeah. He carries his phone and he’s contactable, yeah.”try catch     .               ..

Everybody was widely aware of this – but this was accepted.”He said that tarfs in GB – where there were cost controls to stop unlimited burning – were also higher than the cost of fuel to speed uptake.Stormont’s Department for the Economy has told the inquiry that those who knew that the subsidy was higher than the cost of fuel did not alert it to that fact. It described this as a “conspiracy of silence”.Mr Hegan said: “I say that’s a similar argument to saying [major gas suppliers] firmus and Phoenix Natural Gas have a conspiracy of silence that they’re not telling the department what price natural gas is...there’s no conspiracy of silence as to the price of pellets.“As several people have alluded to, Google’s a wonderful thingthey don’t know. But I’m actually astounded –this is true – that the energy department in [Stormont] would not know the price of fuel on a scheme that they’re rolling out. It’s the equivalent of saying ‘we don’t know what price diesel is we don’t know what price petrol is’.”Mr Hegan said that he never thought to tell officials about the price of biomass fuel because he believed “this was government policy”, adding: “This was seen as a certied upright government scheme...I was under the illusion, shall we say, that there’s people a lot more qualied and a lot more intelligent than I was that had made these decisions and we were out there as a business to implement this.”He said that he would have seemed “a fool”he had pointed out to civil servants what price biomass fuel was, adding: “It would be like me ringing up the department at the minute and saying ‘do you know what price mains gas is ’“I can’t fathom that they wouldn’t understand the price of pellets in a scheme that they’re rolling out - this is a £m, £m scheme and they don’t know what price the fuel is  It can’t be right.”In his written evidence, Mr Hegan said: “It is my steadfast opinion that DETI was aware but chose to ignore the issues, in their quest to roll out the programme.”Sir Patrick put to him the evidence of an energy expert who told the inquiry that energy efficient systems were unattractive because the kwh boilers were so lucrative, with no limits on what could be earned. Mr Hegan said: “Yeah. Well, it was the way in which the scheme was designed [which] led to the proleration of kwh boilers.”Sir Patrick asked: “Why do you think it took so long for that to dawn on the people who designed the scheme ” After a y pause, Mr Hegan said: “I believe they knew.”Danny Kennedy: Former Stormont employment minister off the doleOur little WD - William Dunlops partner Janine shares picture of newborn baby girl Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Sir Patrick said: “If you believe they knew, what do you think the motive was to have a scheme that was extremely monetarily attractive – [that] offered you a profit as opposed to an incentive – what was the motive for that as opposed to one that incentivised an energy effective solution ”Mr Hegan said he believed it was deliberately designed to be ultra-attractive to encourage uptake, as is common with green energy incentives, but that a key flaw had been the failure cut that rate as uptake quickened. He said that when questions were asked of officials “nobody wanted to hear it nobody cared”.try catch     .               ..

Neil included  “We’re not alone as there are so many more people who are missing him every single day.”Neil lived with his family in Garrison, close to the border with Leitrim and Donegal, and had been in a relationship since last November.Neil was the youngest of four children – “the baby of the family” as Cherith describes him.She said: “We’ll remember his laid back approach to everything and his soft and caring nature. His love for animals, driving tractors and country music.    Cherith and her late brother Neil, whom she describes as the baby of the family “We definitely won’t forget the  hens he brought home in the boot of his car or Rosie the goat. “He loved trying to fix anything technical and we’ll miss his handiness.”Neil had left Portora Royal School in Enniskillen after doing his GCSEs, to follow his love of machinery and fixing things.He had also intended to follow his father Eddie into the Orange Order. Legacy Scandal: ‘London and Dublin must not let IRA snatch victory from jaws of defeat,’ says Ruth Dudley Edwards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In terms of starting a career, Neil began a course in land-based engineering in South West College in Omagh. As part of this course, he was doing a work placement three days a week. It was while he was on one of these work experience sessions at a garage in the Boho Road area, to the west of Enniskillen, that the incident which led to Neil’s death occurred.An inquest has yet to take place but it is understood Neil was repairing a tractor when a part fell on him.Emergency services attended, but he died at the scene.Cherith said: “We’re so happy he got to achieve what he did in his letime, it just feels terribly cruel that it was cut so short. “We’ll never forget him. I used to think it couldn’t be true when people say that they thought of someone they have lost every day but it’s absolutely true for us.”At the time of Neil’s funeral his family had asked for donations in lieu of flowers. A total of £, was raised for Air Ambulance NI and £, for Garrison Parish Church.In addition to the money raised in lieu of flowers Neil’s sister Cherith took part in the Great North Run in Newcastle-on-Tyne on Sunday to raise further funds for Air Ambulance NI.Cherith said: “The fundraising hasn’t been easy for all of us. I know I personally have struggled quite a lot. “It’s sometimes hard to feel positive about it because we would do anything to have Neil back.But at the end of the day this is the situation we are in andby supporting Air Ambulance NI in particular, it might even help save someone  one day.”Of the Great North Run, she said: “I have run one other half marathon previously – the Royal Parks half marathon in  – so this was my second half marathon race. “I found the lead up to the Great North Run more dficult that the run itself. “Dedicating the run in Neil’s memory made it a very emotional experience and I was totally bowled over by friend’s and family’s generosity in their sponsorship for Air Ambulance NI. “I was doing each step for Neil so I made sure to enjoy it. As I came down the hill at mile  towards the coast and a country song was playing I knew he was with me. “I was never a sporty person by any stretch of the imagination and only picked up running just over a year ago“It was always something Neil found a bit funny so that made me enjoy it even more to think I would have been putting a smile on his face.”Askedshe planned to continue to motivate yourself in her brother’s memory, she said Neil’s memory would always “push her on to greater things” but that she did not plan on undertaking any more physical challenges for the foreseeable future.Of the possibility of a permanent memorial said: “We are thinking about replacing a plain window in our churchwith a stained glass window that could be in memory of him. “The window is in the porch of the church and almost the last thing you see as you leave so I think it would feel like he’s there watching over us all on a Sunday and on all the special occasions that we’ll have there in the future.“We don’t have any plans for more fundraising ourselves.”Discussing her own grief, Cherith said: “For me this felt and continues to feel like nothing I ever could have imagined. “I find talking about it, especially during the bad times, helps and I’ve been doing whatever  I can to figure it all out.“That could mean listening to podcasts – Griefcast is a good one and not too morbid – or reading articles from other people who’ve been through bereavement.“This week I went to my first bereavement counselling session.” She commented: “I trained as a mental health first aider at my work and through that am really aware of the need to help yourself because no one  can know what’s going through your head or what will help.”Cherith added: “Our community have been a huge support for my family through this time. From the moment of the accident our wider family have helped us through each step and our local community have been pillars of support. “Even on the day of the funeral when there must have been over a thousand people, there were friends and neighbours making sure we were okay and that everyone attending the service was okay, even bringing trays upon trays of iced water to the many people stood around the church as it was such a hot day.“I know my parents especially really appreciate every single card and visit from friends and even strangers they have received and continue to receive. The kindness has been strengthening for all of us.”Sadly the family are no strangers to heartbreak – during the Troubles, Neil’s mother’s brother was murdered by the IRA.Joy Graham’s brother Ronnie Funston – an ex-UDR member – was shot dead by the IRA in March  as he was preparing to feed cattle early in the morning on a farm at Lowery near Pettigo. “Unfortunately I know only too much what it’s like to experience tragedy like this,” Joy told the News Letter at the time of her son’s death in May.Of her son Joy said: “He was a great people person. He loved country music and jiving, going to the country jamborees. He was a great boy – a lovely caring boy. “He wanted his own business. That’s what he’d have loved – that was his dream. “He was trying to get his qualications, learn his trade, and open his own business some day as a tractor mechanic.”Cherith told how important her family’s faith has been in the dark days since Neil’s death.Such is their devotion to God that half of the money raised in lieu of flowers has gone to Garrison Parish.Cherith said: “It’s been a really important place for us. “We go every Sunday we’re at home and my mum plays the organ for every service.“We’ve leaned on our faith a lot over the last few months and our minister Ngozi has been a great support too. “[The donation] felt like the least we could do and we know Neil would have been pleased with that choice. “It was only three days before his accident that Neil had been helping to mow the grass in the graveyard, little to know it was for his own funeral. Although I think he’d say, ‘well at least I got to do a good job’.”The other half of the money raised in Neil’s memory went to Air Ambulance NI: “We are so grateful to everything that the Air Ambulance NI team did when they tried to save Neil. “If it wasn’t for them we’d always have wonderedhe could have been saved.”try catch     .               ..

Fortwilliam and Macrory Presbyterian Church. The -year-old building on the Antrim Road, at the junction of Fortwilliam Park, is to be put up for sale, with the proceeds going towards “mission purposes” in the North Belfast Presbytery and around Ireland.The congregation will be amalgamated with Whitehouse Presbyterian Church at Shore Road, Newtownabbey.Rev Jim Stothers, deputy clerk of the general assembly, said the “exceptional demographic change” in the area over the last  or  years meant the congregation has dwindled to the point where it is “no longer viable”.Attendances at the once thriving church have dropped to a few dozen each Sunday, with only  people contributing to the weekly offering, meaning the income cannot sustain the congregation.   The church has a number of beautul stained glass windows. “While many of our congregations are growing and attracting new families, it is a sad reality that in some areas, parts of north Belfast in particular, some congregations have experienced the opposite,” Rev Stothers said.Other Presbyterian churches in the area that have closed over the past few decades include Duncairn, Clton Street United, St Enoch’s, Oldpark and Macrory Memorial.“This isn’t the first time we have had to take a decision like this in this part of the city,” Rev Stothers continued. “In  there were  congregations made up of around , families. Today there are  congregations, including Fortwilliam and Macrory, with , families.“I can appreciate the deep sadness felt by those who have worshiped faithfully at Fortwilliam and Macrory for many years and the upset that this brings,” he added.   Rev Jim Stothers, deputy clerk of the General Assembly. Fortwilliam Park Presbyterian Church was founded in  to cater for the expanding population of north Belfast.Two ministers of the church – Rev James Breakeyand Rev John Thompson– served as moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.The Antrim Road church amalgamated with nearby Macrory Memorial Presbyterian Church in July  to form Fortwilliam and Macrory Presbyterian Church.

Then I made an eagle on number  after I topped it off the tee.\"I stuck my second to about  feet and holed the putt. The American Golf event makes you feel like a professional golfer because Sky Sports film you for T.V. Itrsquos pretty cool.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However in business, things are really moving and the way we do business is evolving at a breath-taking pace.The biggest change we’re seeing is in all things digital. We now adopt new technology quickly and easily because developers are getting better at using a human-first approach to make complex things intuitive. Take contactless payments.Remember how the first few times you waved your debit card at a machine, it was a bit scary and surreal. We’ve rapidly become accustomed to contactless payments and things like Apple Pay. This once futuristic stuff is now common place and it is really transforming how companies transact.Along with these complex advances come the obvious threats of cyber security, the potentially ransomable value of inidual or company data post-GDPR, and the competitive market risks to businesses which aren’t already on their digital game.While we’re seeing a burgeoning community of tech start-ups through both our own Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and a growing number of incubator hubs in Belfast and Derry, as well as impressive numbers of IT jobs created from inward investment, it’s never too late to begin your digital transformation. The thing is,you’re a tech firm, your financial tech needs to be walking the walk too. Increasingly, we’re finding clients placing more emphasis on this in their choice of banking partner, above all .Barclays was the first bank to develop an ATM over  years ago, and the first UK bank to launch a credit card. In more recent years we were among the first to launch contactless cards, and we were the first bank in Northern Ireland to make cheque imaging available to our clients. In the past  years we’ve invested over £bn in new technology which has meant our clients can be sure our digital technology is right up to date. While other banks are now facing a catch-up period of investment and the challenges of upgrading their s, Barclays has the technology already in place. Our personal banking app was recently voted best in the UK, and our small business  allows businesses to access a pre-approved overdraft limit at the touch of a button.  Our award-winning corporate cash management system, Barclays.net, is tried and tested by the % of UK companies which put it through its paces every day.BEYOND NI: EXPORTS AND CONNECTIONS The spotlight is being turned on Northern Ireland’s exporting capabilities, brought into sharper focus by the issue of Brexit. Without doubt, export sales are one of the key opportunities for growing the economy. We are really excited to work with established export businesses like Moy Park at one end of the spectrum and a successful new tech business, Neurovalens, at the other. This start-up began le as one of the first tenants in the Barclays Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and due to growth, has recently moved into its own premises to accommodate its now more than  staff.While access to money is obviously important for business growth, access to our networks can be just as valuable for NI companies. With Barclays’ major presence in the UK and US, our London and New York private equity contacts are opening doors for Northern Ireland firms looking for market intelligence.This style of partnership working with a local banking team, which can link into a well-established international network, is exactly the foot up our companies need to make them competitive in a global economy.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"justin rush taking pride in recruitment","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Anyone that attended the  Belfast Pride Festival would have been bowled over by the number of participants in the parade, the huge crowds of well-wishers who assembled, and the sizeable number and range of employers supporting the event. It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards.
