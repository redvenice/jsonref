If someone is a total pain in the bottom, I am not afraid to tell them so.’Despite his combative stance, he insisted that life had mellowed him. Alliss was first married in 1953 to Joan McGuinness. They had two children, Gary and Carol.He had four children with second wife Jackie, whom he married in 1969, but their younger daughter Victoria was born with severe mental disabilities. She died, aged nine, in 1982. They also lost an unborn child, eight months into the pregnancy.Those tragedies, he said, taught him tolerance. You never knew, he said, what someone else might be suffering.

In November, Bookshop, a socially conscious alternative to Amazon, launched in the UK, while British company Hive offers a similar service, allowing shoppers to support a local bookshop at checkout. The indie music industry launched Love Records Stores in March to help out traders. Other websites are less conventional – every small business listed on Not On The West End is run by someone who usually makes their living in UK theatre.The cavalry may also be arriving for small traders, albeit belatedly, in the form of a proposed nationwide local shop site run by the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira). It would be run “to enable retailers to effectively sell online to their local markets, not for huge amounts of profit”, says the Bira CEO, Andrew Goodacre.“We’re never going to beat Amazon, we’re never going to be as big as Amazon but perhaps we can compete on a local basis,” he adds.Big stores are expensive to runDepartment stores were once celebrated as temples of consumerism. But mid-market chains like Debenhams and House of Fraser are saddled with large high street stores in town centres where shopper numbers are dwindling but costs, such as rent and wages, are rising.The internet is killing the high streetBy\u0026nbspthe end of 2018 Britons had splurged nearly £70bn via their phones and tablets. That spree is expected to continue, with online sales predicted to hit almost £100bn by 2021, according to consultants at Retail\u0026nbspEconomics. Department stores are in the firing line as fewer Britons now bother to physically visit the high street, with clothing and household gadget sales having moved online fastest.Many indies pivoted immediately, says Goodacre, working hard on social media, installing online payments and click and collect services, but thousands face closure. Research in April suggested almost a fifth of the UK’s small businesses could go bust within a month.But the desire to keep independent shops open is robust, recent research suggests. Working from home has kept people – and their spending – local. A survey carried out by Visa for Bira found that while three in five shoppers were worried independent businesses would not survive, four in five said they were shopping local as much as or more than before the pandemic.Other decentralised, hyper-local sites created on a shoestring are already popping up across the country.In the North of England, towns are queuing up to use the free Totally Locally open source marketing kit. In September, Hebden Bridge became Totally Locally’s first local site to give shoppers the chance to buy from multiple local shops with one online checkout and 30 towns are on a waiting list, says founder Chris Sands.“You can’t just put a sticker on the window, say shop local, and expect everyone to change their mind and do it,” he says. Instead, Totally Locally’s in-depth kit helps local traders create brands and change habits it’s free, all they ask is if you have an idea that works you share it. “We call it the economics of being nice,” he says.The site has made a big difference, says Jim Leach, the co-founder of bespoke plywood kitchen maker Wood \u0026amp Wire based in the Yorkshire town. “A lot of people are putting a lot of effort into getting these things up and running,” he says. “But ultimately people have just got to use it so the ecosystem becomes sustainable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87db1a7b025f1175c6286d9b391f8beb3b746c0/0_13_5231_3139/master/5231.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=182aa66a86f53401a1408d6a4162e2fd","title":"have you experienced racism at a uk university","story":"We would like to hear from black and minority ethnic students and lecturers about their experiencesA new report has concluded that UK universities perpetuate institutional racism.

Now, the palaeoecologist is reaching global audiences with a project that brings to life the microscopic world of pollen by producing giant 3D-printed models from high-quality scans of pollen grains.“Being able to identify pollen is important for many reasons,” he says. Because they can survive millions of years and are tiny and tough, they can help track changing climate patterns, reveal the quality of honey and even provide forensic evidence at crime scenes. “But I love seeing what else people do with the models,” he says. Already they have been used by bee ecologists in Brazil, US school teachers and Irish archaeologists, among others.Wilson’s quest to provide open access to scanning and printing pollen grains in 3D began after winning some money on the online teaching platform I’m a Scientist, Get Me Out of Here for his success in engaging students. He was determined to use the money to share his enthusiasm for pollen, which, he says, most people overlook as dust, except when they have hay fever. He recognised that providing open-access giant models of these tiny unique shapes would have enormous uses for science and education.He has since created a fast, free and accessible way for anyone to print outsize replicas of pollen grains, magnified 2,500 times, via his online 3D Pollen Project. So far, pollen from 35 plant species has been scanned and modelled and he is ready to get to work on the next 100 species sent to him from around the world, including from Europe, Colombia, Tanzania, Ecuador and Mongolia. “It was a long process of trying to figure out how to do it well. But we’re there, and so far they’ve been downloaded 2,500 times in 45 countries,” he says. “I’d like to create a broad spectrum with each branch of the tree of plant life represented, for researchers, schools and other users.”The project has found fans beyond the world of science. “I’ve had emails from mechanical engineers in Israel, fashion designers in Denmark, others in China, the Netherlands … it would be good to make mint pollen chocolates too! 3D printing also has huge potential to revolutionise teaching, especially while social distancing.”Wilson is now a final-year PhD student at the University of Reading, researching, by studying pollen, how climate change and indigenous cultures have influenced critically endangered araucaria forest trees in southern Brazil. He describes pollen shells as “the diamonds of the plant world, one of nature’s toughest materials. They act like a time machine, lasting for millions of years. They tell us how forests are shaped by climate change and people.”To create the 3D Pollen project, Wilson collaborated with Hull University and also had help from Cardiff University’s Bioimaging Research Hub and Dr Katherine Holt, a senior lecturer at Massey University in New Zealand who first developed a set of accurate, 3D-printed scale models of pollen up to 3,000 times their actual size. “The idea has received a lot of interest and uptake, but that should be credited to Oliver, he’s built the profile for the concept,” she says.Wilson’s first scans included pollen from several wind-pollinated European trees that are among the worst for inducing hay fever: oak, birch, alder, hazel, willow, pine and small-leaved lime. His models also include pollen from several important insect-pollinated wild flowers, including from an ox-eye daisy collected in Sweden that looks like a naval mine, that of a vibrant pink coneflower from Chicago botanic garden, plus grains from English meadow clary, ivy, fat hen, wormwood, meadowsweet, knapweed, heather and autumn hawkbit. Most of the pollen grains he has scanned and modelled are 100th to 1000th of a cm in size. Alastair Culham, associate professor of botany at the University of Reading, said: “3D printing has great potential in teaching. It’s the modern equivalent of the famous Blashcka glass flowers at Harvard. They were intended as scientific educational objects primarily, so fall into the same category as 3D printed objects now. They have become works of art but they are very technically precise models and the product of a unique combination of technology, skill and practise.“While printed technology might have the feeling of a mass-market product, those models still need cleaning and de-burring and there is a lot of skill in making the 3D computer model,” he adds. Tony Hayes at Cardiff Univeristy’s bioimaging hub has made 60 pollen models for science centres, plus a prehistoric swamp fossil insect, a giant head of a red ant and a zebra fish larva. “We also created pollen models from an archaeological dig called Footprints in Time, from 5,000 years ago,” he says.”Dr Alex Ball, head of imaging and analysis at the Natural History Museum in London, says exhibits of all sizes are now often being 3D scanned and printed or magnified.“Some exhibits are too small or fragile to handle, whereas these can be made cheaply and replaced easily,” he says. “This is one way of making a collection more accessible. We are exploring how to use them to teach visually impaired people about microscopy. This includes 3D prints of sand and sugar grains, insect heads and coins.”The museum recently worked with artist Emma Gibson on scanning, magnifying and printing grains of sand from a beach, turning them into car-sized sculptures called Quicksand, exhibited at Selfridges in London and destined for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.Dr Paul Wilson at the University of Warwick, who hosted an online symposium this week on the future of 3D visualisation in cultural heritage which brought together museum experts and scientists, says: “Covid is forcing museums to do a whole plethora of different levels of immersion and think in new ways.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3be4336381eab98bfd56120f076437af532c6970/0_120_3238_1943/master/3238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df180ab6d903d530d6b564e3eade5029","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of this week’s best flora and fauna images, including a festive robin and a moth trap"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59d40ee673c88ecbd01f2025e3f5a116393ba2ed/1741_913_2011_1207/master/2011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99cf9805dd7233c6102bc1930632bda0","title":"can tiktok help me teach old cats new tricks","story":"After attempting to train my stubborn moggies to no avail, these 20-second tutorials had my pets following my orders in no timePeople think that cats can’t be trained. They’re wrong. Through careful coaxing and iron patience, I have drilled my cats to stop taking bites out of my mashed potato. They no longer wake me up at the crack of dawn by leaping on to my face. And thanks to my persistence, they are regular, enthusiastic users of the cat flap. Particularly at night when it’s locked and they bash their paws against it like amateur feline bongoists.But this is where my cat-training prowess plateaued – I couldn’t manage to take things to the next level. I did buy a tedious 700-page book that promised feats such as teaching your moggy to sit. I tried random websites’ impressive-sounding tutorials on high-fiving, vaulting and convincing cats to happily don a harness and be walked like a dog. But, invariably, my cats would stray from the plan and I’d be left scouring 800 words of text for a solution. What did my efforts actually teach them? That there’s no better time to steal snacks than when your confuddled owner is staring at his or her phone or into a book. So I gave up.Until today. Now, I am armed with the teachings of School for Cats – a series of TikTok videos, each one around 20 seconds long, making it easy to refer to while training my two beloved feline companions. There’s Mochi, a three-year-old tabby and highly strung madam. Also Poirot, an elaborately moustachioed and insanely rambunctious five-month-old kitten. They’ll be taught separately, though, because – to put it mildly – they are not the best of friends, and it’s difficult to conjure up an informative educational atmosphere in the middle of a fist fight.Day one of training starts well as a super-keen Poirot turns up wearing an elegant tuxedo (which, admittedly, he always does thanks to his black and white fur pattern). But I quickly learn that some of these skills might well be beyond my cats. I’d thought that “lay down” would be the ideal trick to teach a pair of cats that border on narcoleptic. However, when I try gently pushing Mochi into a lying position, she stares balefully at me – her sad, wide eyes dripping with betrayal. Poirot thinks we’re roughhousing, so uses my hand as a scratching post.Another trick, known as “paw” or “shake”, involves getting your cat to give you a high-five by offering them a treat. However, Poirot just ends up biting my fingers until I drop the treat in pain. I move on to the tutorial “over”, in which a compliant cat jumps over an owner’s foot. Mochi, being the contrary moggy that she is, instead learns how to slide under my leg.However, when I find the right trick, I am genuinely astonished by the results. The 360-degree turn that is “spin” is a hit with both of my cats. Not only do they quickly comprehend that they’re meant to follow a treat around in a circle but, after a couple of sessions, they even start following my empty hand in the hope of being rewarded afterwards. Which is the first time I have ever managed to get my cats to do anything without food-based bribery. I mean, if I’m honest, it’s also one of the few times I’ve managed to make them respond to instructions with anything other than a sarcastic narrowing of the eyes. So it’s a double win.What’s more, the training for a trick called “sit pretty” genuinely becomes one of Poirot’s favourite things in the world. Apparently, standing up on his hind legs to reach for a treat is the absolute pinnacle of exciting playtime for a kitten. Hours after one training session, my wife inadvertently points at Poirot during conversation, causing him to leap four feet into the air on to her finger. So successful it is, I’m tempted to rename the trick “fly, my pretty”, or “rocket launch”, or “TAKE COVER! INCOMING CAT!”I’m chuffed. Initially, because the training exercises are a lot of fun. They’re simple to follow, easy to refer to during training and perfect for a creature that has a five-second attention . Plus, they suit the cats.But, eventually, I come to appreciate them for something I hadn’t anticipated. They’ve had lovely consequences for my relationship with my pets. It was fairly predictable that Poirot would take to it, given that he’s an excitable, pliable kitten. But Mochi’s response has been a revelation. She has spent the past two hours sitting next to me on the sofa, just watching me operate a Word document. She’s even begun hopping on to my lap for a snooze – something unheard of since the honeymoon period of her moving in with us. If I’d known that teaching her to spin in circles would make her this content, I’d have done it months ago.Frankly, there’s only one small disappointment in this whole process. No matter how much I scroll, there is one thing I can’t find. Seemingly, School for Cats has no lessons on how to stop your pets playing your cat flap like a bongo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bc9cfd344ef14f902f863df2c81f4fcabb7856/1425_908_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4448c44920eda0df46b69b9db1f6210c","title":"pause and breathe how i learned to meditate with tiktok","story":"Are you finding it hard to switch off and relax? Short and snappy mindfulness videos were just the thing to help me refocusThings I’m good at: multitasking, overcommitting, starting things and not finishing them. Watching Netflix while listening to a podcast while cooking dinner while messaging a friend, while skim-reading an important article.Things I’m not good at: silence, boredom, focusing on the present, being alone with my thoughts. And so, by extension, meditation.I’ve tried to meditate several times over the years, encouraged by stories from friends and experts about how beneficial it is for our mental health, motivation, confidence and clarity. So far, I’ve never managed to make it more than several minutes into a session without: a) falling asleep b) remembering something very urgent that needs to be done right now or c) allowing my thoughts to wander in such catastrophic directions that it leaves me more stressed than when I started. But if I’m ever going to change that, 2020 seems a good time to try.This year, like so many people, I’ve felt my anxiety skyrocket while my productivity and creativity have plummeted. My silence-aversion and phone addiction have reached new lows (I’m talking watching TV on the toilet), and it often feels as if the only way to coax myself through another working day is offering my brain episodes of Gilmore Girls like dog treats to a wayward puppy.So can I finally learn to be mindful? And could I do so by using the zeitgeist social media platform TikTok? The irony of using social media as a tool to refocus my attention isn’t lost on me. But the truth is that beyond the dance challenges and celebrity lip-syncs, TikTok is fast becoming a hub for short and snappy instructional videos about a variety of subjects and skills.Videos tagged #meditation clock up a cool 643m views. And after the number of adult users multiplied more than six times between October 2017 and March 2019, it is little wonder that lockdown saw an influx of professionals and experts using the platform as a teaching tool.But where to begin? While I’m open to a certain amount of omm and woo (a walk that consists of crossing one foot over the other while hopping), it’s fair to say my tolerance for wind chimes is low. One of the first videos I land on is “meditation tips for witches”, which worries me. If witches are struggling, what hope do us muggles have?Still, TikTok’s pick and mix buffet of content suits my natural impatience. There are as many different ways to meditate as there are users to teach me – I just have to find the one that resonates. So I learn about third eye activation. I experience my first sound bath. I watch absurdly beautiful yogis demonstrating their perfect lotus pose and feel burdened by an extra thought: “How can I get my skin to look like that?” I hope the answer is “by aligning my chakras” and not a serum that costs £300.Then I land on Headspace, and things begin to click into place. An extension of the wildly popular mindfulness app, Headspace’s TikTok is filled with videos delivered in the brand’s signature fluff-free style. Here, instead of a woman walking dreamily through a cornfield or a dandelion clock blowing in the breeze, I can breathe in time to soothing images of fresh linguine falling languidly from a pasta maker. My kind of therapy.Having picked up some beginners’ tips, naturally my first impulse is to multitask. Can I meditate in the shower? While running? At Sainsbury’s? But deep down I know that looking for shortcuts only leads me into a mental cul-de-sac. So I commit to 15 minutes of pure meditation every morning. I sit in an armchair I never normally sit in, and feel slightly more enlightened just by seeing the room from a different angle. Deciding it’s probably best not to start off too ambitious, I begin with the easiest possible exercise: breathing.One myth every instructor I watch seems determined to debunk is the idea that meditation means emptying one’s mind in fact, the goal is to let thoughts pass through without panic or judgment. During my second session, I can’t stop thinking about what I’m going to eat for lunch. But as @lovecolbyjanine reassures me, “distractions can be messages”.Next I discover the Miami-based spiritual coach Estefanía, who posts as @alignwithmee. From her Meditation Hack Tuesdays, I’m thrilled to learn about whistle breathing. Whistling is something I am good at. I’ve often lamented the lack of opportunities for talented whistlers to monetise our skills or harness them for good now I can whistle my way to a higher plane! My downstairs neighbours are thrilled.The next morning I move on to fire meditation, as guided by “spiritual seeker” and author @vishuddhadass. Staring at a candle flame for 15 minutes feels more comfortable than keeping my eyes closed, and with the flickering light to focus on I find that it’s easier to gently bring my mind back each time it wanders. For the first time, I’m disappointed when my meditation ends. For all digital tools, there’s a fine line between companion and crutch. I’ve saved more than 20 videos for future reference, but @whitneycatalano advises that when we find ourselves scrolling the internet in a desperate hunt for more information, that’s when we should turn to meditation instead. “You’re craving connection,” she says. “And information is not the same thing as connection.” Like all good teachers, TikTok can only take me so far before I need to put my phone down and go it alone.After a week of morning sessions, I may not have unlocked bountiful secret reserves of creative energy, but I do notice I’m sitting down to work with less weary apprehension than before. I’ve stopped taking my phone to the loo. And I’ve realised something: successful meditation isn’t like conjuring up the image in a Magic Eye picture. It’s not a knack you grasp, or a hypnotic trance you slip into – at least, not at my amateur level.Rather, it’s a practice, in every sense of the word. The most important thing is being prepared to pause, breathe, and see what happens. Sit with my feelings, as the kids say.It turns out, I wasn’t “failing” to meditate all those times before. I was just giving up before it got good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208c4c7316bbcefac43001292d41c149503dee45/1435_723_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0da95454495fe8554b679e6415dd0d7a","title":"fast and fun learning how tiktok became my fount of scientific knowledge","story":"Are you fascinated by the universe but find in-depth online tutorials on existence a bit long-winded? For one writer, short and snappy videos opened his eyes to a different worldThe worst thing about living in a 3D spacetime continuum is how boring the explanations are for it. Having taken almost a year to finish Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes – an experience that felt longer than the creation of the universe – I’ve always been on the lookout for scientists and cosmic experts who can give me an insight into what this thing we call “reality” actually is.I hoped the internet would allow knowledge to travel at warp-speed, enabling my brain to consume information as easily as black holes do galaxies, but found myself confronting the snore-inducing perorations of science geeks who managed to extend their insights on string theory into infinity. Most video platforms allow their experts too much time to show off their intelligence, but that approach quickly drains my enthusiasm. Luckily if, like me, you like your science fast and fun, the video-sharing network TikTok can be an unexpected starburst of scientific know-how.Using simple hashtags to search for the most useful user-generated videos, my learning began. “Everything is connected!” enthused @kerwinrae over stellar visuals, stating that quantum theory dictates that everything breaks down into “nothing but strings” that are laid down like a web over the entire universe. “Pluck a string on Mars,” he says, “and it’s going to vibrate on earth.” In less than a minute, I realised that God is simply a great guitarist, like an ethereal Jimi Hendrix ecstatically playing everything into being.Over a slow Richard Rodgers jazz song, @physicsdude gave me a quick but very comforting chalkboard introduction to the four basic principles of physical reality – these four being the only reactions that cannot be broken down into simpler reactions. Now I know electromagnetism is the reason everything has a solid structure, while the strong force keeps those crazy quarks in order in the nucleus of an atom the weak force, however, is responsible for all nuclear decay. Gravity, I came to understand, is simply “the curvature of spacetime” – but it could be a particle, though that hasn’t been observed yet.The best thing about TikTok is how it captures the “gee-whizz!” enthusiasm that should accompany the understanding of the universe. Given that it’s the greatest creation of all time, you’d think people would discuss it with more excitement than the wearied waffling that is the usual online lecture. Giving users of Tiktok only 60 seconds to get their messages across really helps the material to be easily digested.Another TikTok user, @weirdpioneer – who describes herself as a wife, mother and psychologist – conveys her awestruck fascination with the universe with a special-effects video of the epigeneticist Bruce H Lipton jiving on the structure of existence. Matter, he enthuses, “is just an illusion of energy and light … there is nothing physical”. Physicists, he argues, have broken down the atom to find that, at its fundamental core, “there is nothing material at all – it’s an energy vortex”. The existential implications of this were mind-blowing. “According to quantum physics,” Lipton says, we’re not physical but merely “energy vortices” – just a flicker of the cosmic light-switch, basically.I was saved from the depression that might have accompanied this recognition of my irrelevance by science communicator Athena Brensberger. She makes sure she is easily comprehensible with short, joyous flashes of insight, such as into the “super position” taken by quarks – those particles that make up the particles that make up atoms.While anything bigger than a quark has to have a fixed location in time and space, quarks can occupy two places at once – until, that is, you observe them, when, like naughty children on being discovered, they stop dead in one place. The fundamental cheekiness of reality – hedging its bets until forced to decide what it is by a grownup – is a bit like my romantic history, and made me relate to the universe a lot more. My commitment issues, I can explain to my next girlfriend, are just the underlying fickle nature of the cosmos playing out through human experience.The universe is a big and complex place, and I’m just a small speck in one tiny corner of it. I could spend my whole life studying, but would only grasp the merest fragment of it.In many ways, TikTok is the ideal platform for a layperson to tackle the big questions of existence, keeping me interested while never pretending to arrive at an answer. I might never entirely understand existence but I can always take joy in it, and TikTok seems to be the ideal platform for that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2218bf4efdab78c5e74e573533ecc9718f4821c8/283_800_2488_1493/master/2488.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bfd00d3b6529998d998d6c612d31bf21","title":"alex morgan scores first wsl goal as tottenham ease to win over brighton","story":"A new home, a new manager, a first win and Alex Morgan’s first goal. Finally, life has been breathed into Tottenham’s season. Rehanne Skinner said her introduction to management in England’s top flight “could not have gone any better” after a 3-1 defeat of Brighton.Having moved her team into the club’s Hotspur Way training facility full-time, the former assistant to Phil Neville at England had a very short time after the international break to make an impact, but the win, a performance full of fight and a late penalty for the USA superstar Morgan have transformed the fortunes of the previously winless side.Skinner had said before the game it was “a lot to ask in a short space of time to turn things around”. After, she was “really pleased” with how much had filtered on to the pitch.“They’ve come into the environment, listened to what we want to get out of it and then bought into how we want to play moving forward,” Skinner said. “If you have that you get in a position where things will start to translate into the game a bit better.”Skinner has a much kinder run of fixtures than the one that led to the departure of the co-managers Karen Hills and Juan Amoros. They played top-five teams seven times in their opening 11 games in all competitions, leaving Skinner to inherit players who have gone through test after test against the best in the league.Her attempt to lift spirits swiftly appeared to have worked. Early pressure on Morgan as she skated towards the box led to a generous free‑kick and Kerys Harrop stepped up to whip it into a top corner, grazing a hand of the Brighton goalkeeper, Megan Walsh. At 11 minutes it was Spurs’ earliest goal this term.A hat-trick from Australia striker Sam Kerr helped Chelsea past a resilient\u0026nbspand manager-less West Ham and ensured the Blues stay three points behind\u0026nbspleague leaders Manchester United with a game in hand.England\u0027s Rachel Daly had equalised for the Hammers early in the second\u0026nbsphalf following Kerr\u0027s opener but two more goals from the former NWSL and\u0026nbspW-League top scorer ensured the Chelsea had done enough before a late own\u0026nbspgoal from captain Magda Eriksson.Arsenal remain two points ahead of their London rivals in second after\u0026nbspthree goals in just over 30 minutes crushed Birmingham for a 3-0 win. Hannah Hampton\u0026nbspsaved a Kim Little penalty to keep her team in the game before goals from\u0026nbspforwards Caitlin Foord and Jill Roord and another Little penalty ended\u0026nbsphopes of taking something from the game.Manchester City\u0027s 3-0 victory over Everton, to leapfrog them into fourth,\u0026nbspwas marred by injury to US World Cup star Rose Lavelle. Having scored a\u0026nbspcracker for the US against their World Cup final opponents the Netherlands\u0026nbsplast week, Lavelle was making her second league start for City before being\u0026nbspforced off at half time. First-half goals from England striker Ellen White,\u0026nbspcentre back Gemma Bonner and Canadian forward Janine Beckie had already\u0026nbspensured the win.Bristol City earned their second point of the season in a 1-1 draw after taking the lead\u0026nbspagainst Reading just before half time on the counter. Emma Bissell\u0027s goal\u0026nbspwas cancelled out by Fara Williams but a dominant Reading could not find\u0026nbspthe win.Brighton struggled to carve out chances, with signs of Skinner’s aim of putting her team “in a position where we’re making it difficult for teams to break us down” showing. But just past the half-hour a wild and unnecessary attempt at an overhead clearance from the Australian Alanna Kennedy caught Brighton’s Aileen Whelan in the head and Inessa Kaagman rocketed the ball in to equalise from the spot.Spurs, though, were dominant and Morgan looked to be starting to settle and find her fitness on her return from the US camp in the Netherlands. Making her second start, and fourth appearance, the two-times World Cup winner forced a fine save from Walsh towards the close of the first half.As energy started to sap, Brighton saw more of the ball and had the odd chance. Fliss Gibbons’s long-range effort did not having enough power, though.Morgan had the ball in the net at the far post in the second half but was flagged offside, and it would be the 20-year-old Addison who edged Spurs towards victory, the forward going on a driving, dribbling run, skipping round Walsh and slotting coolly home.Morgan would finally score to ease nerves after Kaagman rattled the bar. Victoria Williams shoved Ria Percival and Morgan slotted in the penalty. There were high-fives all round and it would be her last action she retired to the stands with the other substitutes before turning round and asking her husband, Servando Carrasco, whether he had missed her first goal since the World Cup and pregnancy as he bounced a grumpy baby Charlie up and down.The win lifts Tottenham to ninth, doubles their points tally, and suddenly things don’t look quite so bleak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6c782db25f5e6a3102d178f58851b26afc3300/0_30_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f98540aa4639b963fe888d898f0cbc6","title":"liverpool wolves premier league match report","story":"Five months after the coronation the Kop finally reverberated to the sound of “champions”. Liverpool showed the watching faithful and the rest of the Premier League why with a ruthless dissection of a Wolves team that looked lost without Raúl Jiménez as their focal point.“If no one is injured then it was the perfect night,” said Jürgen Klopp, having dusted off his fist-pump celebration in front of the Kop for the first time since March. “When we came out for the warm-up and heard the noise it was a proper goose-bump moment. It was so nice to hear You’ll Never Walk Alone again too. It was nice that we could give them something back.”Liverpool gave 2,000 fans a first-hand demonstration of their defensive resilience, with the goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher – who changed his shirt at half-time after starting with Kellher on the back – assured once again in the absence of Alisson, and their ability to punish any lapse in the opposition ranks. Unfortunately for Conor Coady and Nuno Espírito Santo’s team, they offered up plenty.Coady endured a night to forget back at his old club as his error led to the opening goal for Mohamed Salah and VAR overturned a penalty he won with a dreadful e. Georginio Wijnaldum, with a stunning second, Joël Matip and Sadio Mané – via a final touch from Nélson Semedo – completed what proved to be a rout. “The high standards we have set were not there,” the Wolves manager lamented. “No doubt we missed Raúl but we need to find a solution fast because we cannot repeat this performance and result again. It was bad.”Liverpool were sharp and quick to exploit any lapse in the visiting ranks. Adama Traoré was initially dangerous on the right of the Wolves’ attack and both defences were regularly stretched in an entertaining first half. Kelleher, handed his Premier League debut for Liverpool after an excellent display against Ajax, produced a fine save to deny Daniel Podence when Jiménez’s replacement attempted to chip the young goalkeeper from Traoré’s lay-off. Traoré created another opening when he skipped away from Fabinho but good covering by Neco Williams prevented Neto connecting with his cross to the far post.The game was finely balanced when Coady’s return to his boyhood club began its descent into a personal ordeal. The England international appeared to have a routine situation under control when Jordan Henderson guided a long ball into the heart of the Wolves defence. His attempted chest towards Willy Boly lacked power and accuracy, however, and with his central defensive colleague sold short Salah pounced on Coady’s error to drive low beyond Rui Patrício. Salah’s 11th goal of the season may have been gift-wrapped but was also reward for his predatory instinct.Coady’s calamitous evening was under way. Wolves were awarded a penalty two minutes before the interval when the defender went down as he challenged for a loose ball inside the Liverpool area with Mané. The Senegal international made a risky attempt to clear Curtis Jones’s header with an overhead kick and the referee, Craig Pawson, immediately pointed to the spot when Mané appeared to connect with Coady’s midriff. But there was no contact. Mané withdrew his foot before Coady came into his sphere and, having been advised to study the pitchside monitor, Pawson rightly overturned his penalty decision. He should have booked the Wolves captain for his attempted deception, however. The Kop made its feelings clear with chants of “cheat, cheat”.Wolves’ display deteriorated from that point. Mané served notice of a dominant second-half performance by the champions with two chances from fine passages of play. For the second opening, side-footed wide by Mané, Salah found Robertson with an inch-perfect cross and the full-back teed up the striker with a first time touch through the legs of Semedo. Liverpool were just getting warmed up.Moments after Coady failed to capitalise on Traoré’s cross into the area Henderson launched a Liverpool counterattack with a first-time ball to Wijnaldum. As the midfielder attacked and surveyed his options, the Wolves defence backed off. Wijnaldum used Coady as a marker and curled an unstoppable finish around the defender and into the top corner from 20 yards.Liverpool’s third arrived from a short corner and another wonderful delivery from Salah. His cross pierced the Wolves defence for Matip to head beyond Patrício from close range.Alexander-Arnold had only been back in the fray for 10 minutes when he provided his latest assist for the fourth. Receiving Jones’s pass in space on the right, the full-back drilled a low cross into the visitors’ area where Mané’s mis-hit shot struck Semedo and trickled over the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d4ccd110ab55825b27bf9baecddd21f355eee1/0_157_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=672d0493a924afbf46f1b85be0b306e5","title":"tottenham arsenal premier league match report","story":"Harry Kane to Son Heung-min. Goal. Son to Kane. Game over. The most lethal double act in the Premier League were at it again, combining to give Tottenham a 2-0 lead by half-time and the platform for a comfortable return to the top of the table.The numbers alone are worth highlighting. Kane has scored 14 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions this season while for Son it is 13 goals and six assists. But it is more than that. It is the understanding that the pair have built, the instinctiveness of it, how they operate at such tempo and with such ruthlessness.It was stamped all over the second goal, in particular, with Kane bending his run around Son on a rapid break before accepting the pass and blasting high past Bernd Leno. Son’s opener had been more of an inidual effort – and a beautiful one, at that – although Kane did get him up and running, and it became a question as to whether Arsenal’s misfiring attack could penetrate the meanest defence in the ision. Most of those present, who included 2,000 vociferous home fans, knew the answer.It was the latest triumph of José Mourinho’s counterattacking gameplan and Kane’s goal meant he became the highest all-time scorer in this derby with 11 – one clear of Emmanuel Adebayor and Bobby Smith.Arsenal’s woes go on. Mired in their worst start to a Premier League season, it is now five defeats in the past seven games in the competition and they cannot buy a break in front of goal. Only the bottom three clubs have scored fewer than their 10.Mikel Arteta played Alexandre Lacazette in a roving role behind Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and he did not look like the creative solution as Arsenal struggled to break the lines or get in behind Spurs. They dominated possession but their play was almost always in front of their rivals – in other words, where Mourinho wanted them. It felt as though Arsenal could have worked their patterns all night without reward. They crossed and crossed and then crossed some more but Spurs kept on clearing.Arsenal knew they had to be wary of Spurs’ transitions but it is one thing to know that and quite another to stop them. They fell behind after one of their moves broke down on the edge of the Spurs area and it was Eric Dier clearing from Héctor Bellerín’s cross and Serge Aurier helping the ball up to Kane on halfway.Kane held the ball up, as Gabriel stepped off him – a bad idea – before he turned and played in Son up the inside-left channel. Son cut inside and unfurled a trademark curler for the far corner, getting everything just right and leaving Leno clutching at thin air. Bellerín sank to his knees in anguish.The contrasting fortunes of the key central midfielders on either side was instructive. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg was once again outstanding in front of the Spurs back four whereas Thomas Partey lasted only 45 minutes for Arsenal upon his return from a thigh injury. Even worse, when Partey felt a recurrence of the problem and headed off, he left a hole for Spurs to exploit for the second goal. “We had four versus three and suddenly Thomas is walking towards me,” Arteta said, doing a good job of hiding his exasperation.Aurier intercepted a Bellerín cross that was meant for Aubameyang and when he set Giovani Lo Celso away it was shocking to see that Spurs had four counterattackers against two defenders. Lo Celso, who played in place of Tanguy Ndombele, who was ill, found Son and there was an inevitability about what happened after that. Kane’s overlapping run was well timed the finish from a tight angle was lashed in off the underside of the crossbar.Arteta pushed his full-backs high at the start of the second half and it added up to him going for broke in light of how threatening Spurs were on the break. Having failed in the first half to work Hugo Lloris, who was passed fit after a health scare, the visitors knew they needed the next goal and they had a couple of openings straight away.Lacazette drew a save out of Lloris with a flicked header from a free-kick before Kieran Tierney picked out Aubameyang with a lovely cross. The Arsenal captain headed high – a bad miss. He has not scored a league goal in open play since 12 September.Arsenal camped inside the Spurs half after the interval but their only other real chance came on 68 minutes when Lloris fumbled a Lacazette header around his post.Mourinho has never lost a home game against Arsenal while Arteta has never beaten him as a player or manager. Neither record felt in peril."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872f4ba4ccda7f091afb21b276e6700e16ac6b4e/0_154_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ebf83bc909386335ce18d0175b4227","title":"covid deepens south and north of england inequalities study finds","story":"IPPR North report reveals few signs of government’s levelling up agenda becoming reality Covid-19 has deepened inequalities between the north and south of England, with little sign of the government’s “levelling up” agenda becoming a reality, a thinktank has warned, in an urgent “wake-up call” to Boris Johnson.The north is experiencing levels of unemployment not seen since 1994, with areas put under the strictest tier 3 restrictions among the worst affected, IPPR North said in its annual health-check of the economy of the north of England.In October, 657,900 people claimed unemployment-related benefits in the north of England, with tier 3 Blackpool, Middlesbrough and Hull among the hardest hit. That is almost double the number in October 2019, when there were 340,220 northern claimants.But the government’s “one size fits all” approach to compensating affected areas takes no account of the fact the UK entered the global pandemic with deep, growing ides between and within England’s regions caused by decades of centralisation and 10 years of austerity, IPPR North said.“Covid-19 makes the challenge of reducing regional inequalities even greater than before – especially for a government whose election platform rested heavily on a promise to do just that. ‘Levelling up’ is the latest in a long history of initiatives that refer loosely to regional rebalancing … to date, however, it is also one of the most striking for its lack of detail on how rebalancing is to be achieved,” the IPPR North’s report says.A £4bn levelling up fund for England was announced last month, to pay for “local infrastructure that has a visible impact on people and their communities”.“Unfortunately this will be a centrally administered fund, thereby missing an opportunity to strengthen devolution, build on the local knowledge and expertise of combined and local authorities,” IPPR North says.Covid has affected the health, livelihoods and future prospects of people in different ways, depending on where they live. It has “created new regional inequalities and deepened old isions”, the report adds.But there are fewer job opportunities in the north compared with the rest of England, IIPR North found, with 0.7 jobs per person in the north, lower than the English average (0.74 jobs per person).In addition, median wages are lower in the north than England as a whole, with 5 million northern workers paid less than the real living wage.The director of IPPR North, Sarah Longlands said: “Our regional ides are severe and growing, we face a climate emergency, and Brexit is just around the corner, so a recovery from Covid-19 that simply restores the status quo – which has failed so many northerners – would be unacceptable.“We need to challenge old, reductive assumptions about our economy because they’ve failed to create the conditions for a good life for everyone in the north. In particular, we have to stop assuming that the centre knows best and commit once and for all to a clear programme of regional devolution in England. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past … This is a wake-up call. Is the government listening?”An Treasury spokesperson said: “Recovering from coronavirus is the biggest challenge the UK has faced in living memory and we can’t shy away from the fact our national recovery will be difficult. But we are totally committed to levelling up opportunities across the whole of the UK as we build back better.“Whilst we have taken unprecedented action to protect jobs through the furlough scheme we have also taken significant steps with new investment in green technologies to create thousands of high-quality jobs in the north, setting out plans for freeports, and investing £100bn in infrastructure to boost growth.“Our new £4bn levelling up fund will support the fabric of everyday life, including high streets and train stations. The Treasury is also reforming the green book, which appraises the funding of projects, to focus on regional impact, as well as plans to open a new Treasury office and our new UK infrastructure bank in the north in the coming year.“The civil service has committed to relocating 22,000 civil service roles outside of London and the south-east, as well as a step change in investment in skills to boost people’s chances of success wherever they live.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace86bcf57f832d8d6030a0da4a74a6166df944c/0_2072_4219_2530/master/4219.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cf9e66ab017dc6897d629eb34815bb5c","title":"how to have a covid safe christmas","story":"Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

My history with Greece began in my 20s, although I arrived here via Cyprus, where I spent some of my childhood.I initially trained as a cub reporter with the Associated Press, before working as a freelance for various print media and the BBC.When communism collapsed and it was clear the Balkans were about to go up in flames, I took the decision to make Athens my base. It was for a series of long reads in the New Statesman and an Observer investigation I conducted on babies born of rape during the Kosovo war. I came away with a renewed sense of purpose, a desire to dig deeper, think bigger, speak truth to power, but also with an innate appreciation that in any journalism, emotional intelligence is key.Whether it was migrant abuse in the heart of Washington DC, human trafficking, honour killings in Turkey, or Iraq-bound weapons inspectors rotating in and out of Cyprus, their regional base, I resolved to take a broader approach.Every country has its challenges: writing about Greeks and Greece comes with its own set of perils. Perceived criticism – though this has abated – is prone to igniting debate and denunciations. The Macedonian question, issues of identity, and ethnic and religious minorities are especially sensitive, as is the 1946-49 civil war and the tumultuous events that preceded it.A natural suspicion of foreigners, derived from decades of interference in domestic affairs, has no doubt played a role. I have yet to forget how one rightwing paper reacting to a seemingly innocuous story on the rivalry between Athens and Thessaloniki back in the 1990s ran the front-page banner headline “ and Foreign Office are carving up our country”.Years later, the newspaper’s retired editor gamely told me that in deciding to run the story so prominently he must have been “in particularly conspiratorial mood”.I received death threats during the Andreas Papandreou era, which prompted the British embassy to send a protection officer to “sweep” my then home.When a story creates such ripples it results in change – for the better. That was certainly the case with the Kosovo rape babies investigation. Years later, campaigners spoke of the impact it had had highlighting their plight.Greece may be the land of mythological heroes but I have met more than a few modern heroes too great Greeks like Manolis Glezos, a man who blended humility and resilience with extraordinary conviction and strength of mind. Being denounced as a “dirty piece of rag” by Jean-Marie Le Pen’s Front National after swimming out to interview him on a floating deck off Corfu was unexpectedly flattering, closely followed by Pope Francis on Lesbos waving in my direction and the hundreds around me as he stepped on to the tarmac at Mytilini airport.Barack Obama referencing a piece I had written on his last international trip as US president was more seriously uplifting. It was his final big speech on foreign soil, barely two weeks after Trump’s unforeseen victory, and he chose to repeat the words of Melia Eleftheriadi, an Athens prefecture employee I’d interviewed at the height of the refugee crisis, saying it was women like her who gave him cause for hope. I’d met Melia by chance in a work cabin outside an Olympic Games stadium that was serving as a drop-off depot for refugee aid. She was describing the generosity she had witnessed despite the debt drama that was pummelling so many Greeks, when she said: “The feeling, right now, is we live under the same sun. We fall in love under the same moon. We are all human – we have to help these people.”It was such a wonderful quote I underlined it in my notebook. Hearing Obama utter the same words to rapturous applause eight months later gave me pause to reflect on the power of reportage at a time when the man who had made “fake news” part of the political discourse had just won the US election.It wasn’t until the summer of 2018 that Greece exited its final bailout. The crisis began in late 2009, and at its most intense, when a chaotic eurozone exit seemed inevitable, it resembled being on a runaway train. No one knew what was around the next bend. It was an existential crisis with potentially explosive effects for Europe. That became clearer as events unfolded and in that sense it gave new meaning to the old adage: beware of small states.In 2015 the rollercoaster intensified. Syriza assumed power on a radical left agenda pledging to “erase” the austerity measures Athens had voted to adopt to avert bankruptcy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s decision to then call a referendum on the onerous conditions set by creditors saw the drama crescendo.It was hard to recognise the country I love. It had become one big wound. I had friends who were badly affected and that was heartbreaking. A decade after the 2004 Athens Olympics, people in middle-class districts beneath the Acropolis were struggling to feed themselves as hunger and malnutrition emerged in tandem with joblessness and homelessness. The crisis undoubtedly exposed the flaws of the state. But it also confounded expectations. Although struck by loss in myriad ways, Greeks exhibited admirable fortitude and became a poster child of the resistance and resilience of our age.Absolutely. Despite analysts predicting a dip in the party’s popularity when snap elections were called by Alexis Tsipras in September 2015, Golden Dawn retained its position as the country’s third biggest political force.An estimated 500,000 Greeks voted for the anti-immigrant group. Only months earlier its leaders had been put on trial accused of operating a criminal gang under the guise of being a political party.The showing was testimony to the extremists’ ability to not only exploit anger and despair – pernicious side-effects of the crisis – but fears stoked by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees when that crisis also hit Greece. It also got precious support from sympathisers in the police and security services. Both provided the cover that enabled the party to survive despite Golden Dawn hit squads so flagrantly sowing terror on the streets.The murder of the popular anti-fascist musician Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013 was a turning point. It took the assassination of a Greek by a professed Golden Dawn operative to galvanise public opinion and re-energise the anti-fascist movement. Before his death, attacks on migrants had been tolerated by authorities.As the trial progressed and the case file of incriminating evidence assembled by female magistrates became increasingly apparent, support dropped.Golden Dawn cast itself as a nationalist force and, until the end, rejected any label that linked cadres to nazism or fascism. Its racist ideology was dressed up as patriotism.By July 2019, when Greece had marked almost a year of post-bailout “normality”, the centre-right New Democracy party was able to win over disaffected voters, shamelessly playing the nationalist card itself. After Golden Dawn failed to enter parliament, it was a matter of time before infighting and defections sealed its fate.The era as we have known it is over. Golden Dawn fell victim to its own proclivity for violence. The party’s leadership received 13-year prison terms and are expected to remain behind bars for several years yet. But it will be harder to stamp out the ideas that fuelled its meteoric rise. Far-right nationalists will want to regroup and may well be boosted if the pandemic’s corrosive effects are overly felt and migrants and refugees begin landing en masse on Greek shores again.Few media organisations have elected to cover Greece with an Athens-based correspondent as comprehensively or consistently. As the world’s oldest Sunday newspaper, the Observer was writing editorials about Greece and asking: “What is to be done with it?” – only decades after its emergence as a modern state in 1854.In the name of cultural justice both papers have always backed the repatriation of the Parthenon marbles to Athens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4903c685a4f8f2be69eddc54e7c118b7e6a2e0/31_217_3911_2347/master/3911.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=47b552a7b24b89778bb5819c9a0be1a7","title":"the best albums of 2019 no 10 moses sumney grae","story":"Sumney’s playful, genre-splicing second album showed a man determined to present life in all its richness and contradictionMoses Sumney’s music is often two things at once. Intimate yet communal, spiritual yet lustful, his piercingly clear falsetto is interchangeable with a full-throated roar – it all speaks of the tension between the mind and the body, feeling and identity.The American songwriter’s delicate first album, Aromanticism (2017), was full of whispered yearning for emotional connection. Its follow-up is more mercurial. As with the fused diphthong of its title, Græ’s two parts, released in February and May, communicate an “inherent multiplicity”, as the author Taiye Selasi says on the track Also Also Also And And And.From the playful oppositions of its track titles – JillJack, NeitherNor – to Sumney’s genre-splicing of R\u0026ampB, folk, jazz and ambient electronics, Sumney’s moods swing and sway. Cut Me pairs rumbling synth bass with an infectious top-line melody, and his lyrics about wanting things that cause him pain capture an occasional paradox of desire. Virile is a distortion-fuelled rallying cry against masculine stereotypes, with Sumney ironically toasting “cheers to the patriarchy”. The languorous Two Dogs is a seemingly irreverent ballad concerning the song’s opening lines: “I had two dogs  In the summer of 2004.”These meandering references, coupled with Sumney’s musings on perception, belonging and acceptance can make Græ seem impenetrable where Aromanticism was a forlorn testimony to vulnerability, Græ enacts the whole mess of living itself. But therein lies its value, with its nuances and apparent contradictions presenting the breadth of experience that makes up a life. (Perhaps its sprawl is also in defiance of an early critical tendency to pigeonhole him as an R\u0026ampB artist.) As with previous collaborators Sufjan Stevens and Perfume Genius, Sumney wrangles with his identity without boxing it in.Like Marvin Gaye, another great falsettoist and purveyor of intimacy, Sumney shores up the solipsism of standout ballads Me in 20 Years and Bless Me with the whispers of multitracked harmonies – but as they are constructed solely from his voice, this is an illusion of company. Sumney is alone for other facets of his creative output, too: he directs his videos, such as in the bodily abstractions of Bless Me, and he is the centre of the Græ album cover, draped nude over a glistening rock like a new element unearthed from the surrounding fauna.It doesn’t feel egocentric:Græ enacts a messy and complicated psychology in a deeper exploration of identity. Across its 20 tracks and two sides, we witness that multiplicity of a life – from considerations of death (NeitherNor), to being wanted (Polly), to analysing our sense of morality (Bystander) – all through Sumney’s unmistakable and unshakable voice. Certainty is a trap, he seems to say, as he chooses to live in the in-between."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1365c618cfe2643d40d2f8674b037b90f67df179/491_205_2777_1667/master/2777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb37f7c0fd7fcea74002cc578008213","title":"uk music streaming startup backed by kylie secures 13m funding","story":"Investment puts Roxi on track for a potential £200m flotation on London Stock ExchangeA British music streaming startup backed by Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams has secured multimillion-pound funding from investors including the former EMI chairman Guy Hands and the private equity firm Sun Capital, whose portfolio has included Pizza Express and Punch Taverns.The investment puts the firm on track for a potential £200m flotation on London’s stock market.Roxi touts itself as the world’s first “made for TV” music experience, offering products including karaoke and a 55m song catalogue, and is currently available on Sky’s Q service and Google’s Android TV.Last month it announced Minogue as an investor in a three-year deal that includes fronting its advertising campaigns.It has raised £13m in funding to accelerate the delivery of the service and expand internationally.This is Hands’ first dabble in the music industry since his private equity firm Terra Firma’s ultimately disastrous £4.2bn takeover of EMI, then home to Minogue and Coldplay, in 2007.The funding round, which is thought to value Roxi at about £50m, will be used to expand the service to potentially 500m devices by 2022 by launching on platforms from Samsung and LG smart TVs to PlayStation and Apple TV.“We have seen huge growth during lockdown, with people using their TVs for more interactive entertainment at home,” said Rob Lewis, Roxi’s founder. “The fundamental thing is when you are looking at a potential initial public offering in the future you want to be growing as quickly as you possibly can be. And with this funding, Roxi is ready to start to roll out on other platforms and in other countries.”The funding round, the first to bring on an institutional investor, includes figures such as Henrik Holmark, the former finance chief at the music service Pandora, and Chris Wright, the founder of Chrysalis Records. Other backers include Lorna Tilbian, the chairman of Dowgate Capital and a former board member at the ad group M\u0026ampC Saatchi, and Roxi’s chairman, Rupert Howell, a former senior executive at ITV and the publisher of the Mirror.Existing investors include the McLaren Group founder, Ron Dennis, and Paul McGuinness, the former manager of U2.If Roxi can hit its growth targets it is understood to be looking to make an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in 2022. Interest is booming in businesses attempting to tap into the music streaming phenomenon, with the world’s three biggest labels – Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony Music – also shareholders in Roxi.Hipgnosis, a London-listed firm offering investors the chance to cash in on the royalties from songs by artists from Bon Jovi to Beyoncé, has raced to a £1bn valuation. In August the British music tech startup MelodyVR, which films and streams gigs fans watch with virtual reality headsets, bought the streaming pioneer Napster with the aim of creating a “truly next-generation music service”.Edward Spencer-Churchill, the co-founder and partner of Sun Capital Partners, said: “We are excited by Roxi’s opportunity to deliver unique, fun music entertainment experiences into the home. The potential is huge, with mass-market appeal and a nation waiting to be entertained.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6905b9c90367e147a53de563f9ceb0446d15b9bb/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2312bb18c7db2978486ac0d66556c61e","title":"the rise of the chumocracy","story":"Investigations into how lucrative Covid-related government contracts were awarded have raised serious questions about cronyism. ’s Felicity Lawrence and David Pegg investigateA recent investigation by the ’s special correspondent Felicity Lawrence found that a man with connections to the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, and no previous experience in medical supplies has for about six months been manufacturing tens of millions of plastic vials for Covid test kits.

That’s why young people are at the heart of our charity appeal this yearIn a year of blight, uncertainty and lives interrupted, 21-year-old Aadam Patel’s experience of the pandemic will resonate among many young people and their families: “I have pressed pause on my life,” he told the  in October, “and although I’m dying to resume it, I don’t even know if there’s a play button there any more.”Getting life back on track during Covid has proved hard for many of us but for millions of young people it will be a very major challenge. Society’s odds were already stacked against youngsters from economically deprived communities and from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds the pandemic has brought those stark inequalities into even sharper focus, whether it is in the job market, around holiday hunger, or access to online schooling.Young people have lost time and opportunity to the pandemic. Schools and colleges closed, exams were abandoned and careers put on hold. Young workers were hit hardest by job losses and furlough. For many youngsters lockdown disrupted the fragile community support structures and relationships they had come to rely on. Covid stopped or pushed online much of the UK’s youth work provision, which had been already eroded by years of cuts. Isolation and loneliness have grown, and mental illness has surged.It is a terribly hard time to be young.By putting young people at the heart of this year’s  and Observer charity appeal, we signal our support for the generation we hope will flourish after Covid. Today’s young people must not become a lost generation. They cannot be left behind, or treated as collateral damage.

But an hour before the start of play it became apparent this game was in doubt when neither team appeared at the ground.The announcement of a delayed start was then followed by the match’s full cancellation. Monday’s second ODI will not take place until Tuesday at the earliest, and the entire tour is in jeopardy. England still have an enlarged 18-man squad here – down from 23 during their 3-0 series win in the Twenty20s – and the new “best-case” scenario is described as two back-to-back 50-over matches at Newlands on Tuesday and Wednesday.Little is certain after England were told at 5pm on Saturday that two members of staff at the Vineyard hotel – the base for both teams – had tested positive for the virus, one of whom had been working in close contact with the tourists.The England camp was immediately tested again that evening and two positive results came back in the morning. All players and support staff were then forced to isolate in their rooms, although this was later relaxed to allow everyone bar the two positive cases some limited use of the outdoor areas.In the joint statement announcing the cancellation of the match, these were described as “unconfirmed positives” and it is understood that England’s medical lead on tour, Dr Moiz Moghal, has requested independent verification of the results.The two cases in question are reporting no symptoms and there is said to be a query over unusually high levels of viral load shown up in their respective PCR tests England’s suspicion here is that two false positives may have been returned.If the cases are confirmed following this new analysis, the two unnamed members of the touring party face a 10-day isolation period before being permitted to leave South Africa, pushing them beyond the team’s departure via charter flight on Thursday.Anyone deemed to be a close contact – at least 15 minutes face-to-face in the 48 hours before their latest round of tests – may also have to stay behind. The bulk of the squad are due a rare Christmas at home, although Lewis Gregory, Liam Livingstone, Tom Curran, Jason Roy and Sam Billings are meant to head to Australia for the Big Bash League.There remains an obvious will among the top-level administrators of both boards to get some more cricket played before the end of the tour. However the sense of unease at this prospect is growing.For Cricket South Africa, already struggling financially, a wiped out three-match series would see it lose an estimated £1.5m and threatens upcoming visits by Sri Lanka, Australia and Pakistan during this home season.The England and Wales Cricket Board, meanwhile, will be reluctant to abandon a tour early in response to a relatively small number of cases given the precedent this may set before a packed 2021 home summer that includes a lucrative visit by India.There is clear frustration, however, that after an English season which did not return a single positive test result during the visits of West Indies (men and women), Pakistan, Ireland and Australia, the biosecure set-up in South Africa has not worked. The first of the home side’s three positive cases was detected by initial screening on 18 November - before their players came together in Cape Town - with the second, two days after their arrival, believed to have been successfully isolated also.There was then a 10-day gap before a third player reported symptoms at the start of this apparent recent outbreak, leaving the hotel owners and CSA baffled as to how the integrity of the so-called bio-secure bubble had been compromised.The hotel staff have been staying on site throughout the tour, with the perimeter guarded by security and overseen by the Claremont police.The two squads cannot mix and there is a rota for common areas, which are cleaned in between usage.No one can enter or leave for matches or training unless in an assigned vehicle – the drivers also stay on site – and though golf has also been permitted at nearby Boschenmeer, players do not come into contact with outsiders and there are strict hygiene protocols in place.All hotel staff were retested on Saturday and returned a full set of negatives on Sunday. Further confusion comes from the fact that two positive staff members have been working in different designated zones throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47ee85ff8c076aac7ff978f9ccd1a57b99ff081b/477_277_5244_3147/master/5244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f329c2b671f210e0a94e911d3609c19","title":"panto  how theatre cancellation affects local economy covid malvern","story":"Covid puts paid to Malvern staging Peter Pan – and a possible £500,000 at the box office – but there are wider implicationsIn a normal year, Malvern Theatres would now be in final rehearsals for its annual pantomime.This year it was due to be Peter Pan, the panto about the boy who refuses to grow up, and the curtain should have been going up on Thursday.But for the first time in two decades, the main 880-seat auditorium in the Worcestershire spa town’s theatre will not be echoing to the sound of hundreds of children shouting “he’s behind you”. Uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and accompanying restrictions prompted Malvern Theatres’ chief executive, Nic Lloyd, to decide back in May to cancel the year’s box office highlight.From a financial point of view, it was a difficult call – and one that will not only have an impact on the venue. For all their fun, pantos are a serious business for theatres – and for many of the businesses around them.“It was a very hard decision. Without the Christmas season you have no chance of breaking even,” Lloyd says.“The panto is crucial for the theatre, as we are unsubsidised, but also for the local economy, to which the theatre is a huge contributor.”Last year’s show, Aladdin, played 34 performances from 12 December into January and almost 31,000 people went to see the show – more than the population of Great Malvern itself – and it grossed just shy of £500,000 at the box office.Pantos guarantee packed houses over several weeks – often supporting venues for the rest of the year – and generate more than £60m in annual revenue for Britain’s theatres, according to the trade association UK Theatre.For Malvern, unlike many other theatres, the loss of the panto will be a financial blow but not a mortal wound.The charitable trust that runs the Theatres has received a £971,000 grant from the government’s £1.57bn culture recovery fund, as well as donations from audience members, which Lloyd believes has secured its future until March next year.The town at the foot of the Malvern Hills is a perennial draw for walkers but it also boasts a rich cultural history, including 135 years of theatre performances on the current site.In more recent times, Malvern Theatres’ reputation has drawn audiences from Birmingham, Bristol and Wales, all about an hour’s drive away.And these visitors do not only support the venue. According to Sheffield University research for the Arts Council, the contribution of the Theatres to the local economy has been estimated at up to £21m a year.That comes as no surprise to local traders. “The panto pulls in people,” says Nigel Morris, rearranging Christmas decorations in his homeware shop, Rhubarb Home, down the road from the theatre. It is one of two shops he runs in the town with his wife Sara and son Jack.“There is a matinee, and an evening performance, so people get here earlier, grab a coffee and usually have an hour or so to kill in town,” he says.Despite the lack of panto, trade seemed to have bounced back after lockdown, says Morris, as he sells fairy lights and baubles to a steady stream of customers.Shopping for festive decorations on their lunch break, solicitors Victoria Knight and Emma Grantham say family trips to the pantomime are an essential part of the Christmas season. “I don’t tend to go to anything at the theatre but the panto,” Knight says.“It’s not going to be same this year,” says Tom Floyd, the owner of Abbey Road Coffee, a vegetarian cafe a few hundred metres from the theatre.Before coronavirus, the coffee shop was a popular haunt of the actors and technical staff working on productions. In the past few months, Floyd has noticed more customers in the morning but afternoons are quiet.AJ Bains is optimistic that in 2021 trade will return to the Mount Pleasant hotel he manages at the top of the town’s high street. But, for now, he is missing room and restaurant bookings from theatre patrons.“We do a pre-theatre menu normally, and we do really well out of it. We’d usually have quite a few covers booked,” Bains says.In a year without thousands of theatregoers, Malvern Hills district council is trying to boost trade in December and beyond, says Sarah Rouse, the leader of the council.“We are looking at what can we do in January because usually the panto rolls on until then,” she says. “It was very disappointing, everyone loves the panto, but the reaction was, what can we do to counter it?”The council has appointed a new staff member tasked with managing the town centre’s recovery from the pandemic, and extra Christmas markets have been booked.While there won’t be a pantomime dame gracing the stage, Malvern Theatres will not remain dark during the festive season. The foyer has been decked with fairy lights, and rehearsals have begun for a festive play, The Snow Goose, which will run over 70 minutes without an interval for four nights during December. It also plans some film screenings and a comedy magic show for kids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ede253e1907757d17810d411c922b75b3f4946bd/0_137_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a8b433a09adf3113d6fb07452686fed","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated regularlyTop theatre shows to watch online this ChristmasWhat does it mean to stage a play in an empty theatre, no matter how many are watching on Zoom?

She reflects on Netflix’s unlikely chess drama hit and her next film, an Edgar Wright psychological thrillerTalking to Anya Taylor-Joy about The Queen’s Gambit often feels like poking your nose into somebody else’s relationship. So intensely does she feel about her character in the hit Netflix drama, heroine Beth Harmon, it’s almost like a love affair.“Beth is the character I’ve given the most of myself to,” says the 24-year-old actor. “I didn’t realise until I met her that she was a voice I’d had in my head for as long as I remember. I’m goofier and lighter-hearted than Beth – but we have a lot of the same struggles and at our core, we’re pretty similar. I was heartbroken when I had to stop playing her. I’m just glad I got to spend seven hours with her. If it had been a two-hour movie, I would’ve had to be dragged out kicking and screaming.”Based on the novel by Walter Tevis (author of The Hustler and The Man Who Fell to Earth), The Queen’s Gambit follows an orphan in 1950s Kentucky who becomes a chess prodigy, before struggling with drug addiction during her quest to become world champion. A word-of-mouth hit during the second lockdown, it has become the streaming service’s most-watched scripted series. Taylor-Joy finds its ratings mind-boggling. “I get overwhelmed quite easily,” she laughs. “My brain can’t picture more people than 5,000, so 62 million households having seen it is something I can’t grasp. When things become this successful, it’s not about you any more – it belongs to everybody. I prefer that, I think.”The performance of her career so far came as easily as Beth checkmating an opponent. “There was no real preparation for playing Beth,” says Taylor-Joy. “The second I finished the book, she was there. I just had to set her loose when the time came.”Set her loose she did. Beth is a flame-haired force of nature who rises from being taught chess by the orphanage janitor to jetting around the world for international tournaments. “I’m too close to her to say she’s a feminist icon but I’m grateful people are taking to her in that way,” says Taylor-Joy.There was one crucial piece of preparation – learning how to play chess. “I’d never played a single game before,” she says. “I’m thrilled that my introduction came from such phenomenal teachers and people with such love for the game.”Former world champion Garry Kasparov and renowned chess coach Bruce Pandolfini acted as consultants, ensuring an authenticity that has won approval from aficionados. The show has been credited with sparking a resurgence in the game, especially among women. Sales of chess sets have increased tenfold.“It was important for me to honour the chess community and understand what I was doing,” says Taylor-Joy. “But I also likened Beth’s passion for chess to my passion for acting. It’s a calling. You answer it. Then you become obsessed and spend the rest of your life figuring out how to get better at it.”No spoilers, but the show’s uplifting climax sees the geeks inherit the world. “It’s a story about overcoming your personal demons and coming to peace with yourself,” says Taylor-Joy. “Only then can you open your arms and accept the love and support of others. One of the things I connected to most was that Beth was so lonely. Even though there are always people around her, she can’t reach out to them because she’s not comfortable in herself. It’s beautiful when she eventually does. We’re stronger together than we are apart.”At the start of 2020, Taylor-Joy also starred in director Autumn de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton’s sparkling, snarky adaptation of Emma. Was she already a fan of the Jane Austen novel? Or, indeed, 90s teen comedy Clueless, which relocated the action to a Beverly Hills high school? “Absolutely to both,” she laughs. “Emma felt fated for me.”The odd uncomfortable corset aside, Taylor-Joy had a ball as “handsome, clever and rich” matchmaker-cum-interferer Emma Woodhouse. An uproarious, all-British supporting cast combined hip homegrown talent (Johnny Flynn, Josh O’Connor) with more experienced thesps (Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart).“I’d worked a lot in America at that point and really loved it,” she says. “But I’d never experienced being part of a community of actors who all lived in the same city. It really felt like we were a company. I’ve never done theatre but that was the closest I’ve come. I treasured that and we became firm friends. The WhatsApp group is alive and well!”One unforgettable scene saw Emma suffer a sudden nosebleed during a moment of high emotion – and it’s not achieved with trickery. Remarkably, Taylor-Joy managed to start bleeding from her right nostril on cue.It’s quite an ability to have. “I always joke that I’m like Liam Neeson in Taken in that I have a very particular set of skills that would render me useless anywhere else other than in the acting world,” she chuckles.Next is Edgar Wright’s time-travelling psychological horror Last Night in Soho, which arrives in cinemas next April. “It’s very different to Emma and The Queen’s Gambit,” says Taylor-Joy. “When people see it, hopefully they’ll understand why I found it difficult to work out who I was after shooting the three projects back-to-back.”Last Night in Soho also features the last performance by Diana Rigg, who died in September. “She was such a spitfire,” says Taylor-Joy. “I’m so sad that she’s gone but I know she was very proud of our film. She had a wonderful friendship with Edgar that you’ll probably be able to see on screen.”Taylor-Joy describes herself as “a mutt of different nationalities”. Born in Miami to a Zambian-British-Spanish mother and Scottish-Argentinian father, then schooled in London, she’s admitted to feeling like she doesn’t fit in anywhere: “I was too English to be Argentine, too Argentine to be English, too American to be anything.”I wonder if her penchant for period roles might be partly because she feels like she was born out of time too? “I feel like I was born off the planet,” she laughs.This has been something of an annus mirabilis for Taylor-Joy, although she’s aware how strange that sounds. “It’s difficult to celebrate that too much when the world is in the grip of a pandemic,” she says. “But it has been wild. I’ve also been strangely grateful for the space it’s afforded me. Since I started working in my teens, I’ve never stopped to take stock of what I’ve achieved. The first lockdown was the first time I was able to just sit and reflect on my experiences, not just chuck them in a box to deal with later. At the speed I was going, I wouldn’t have gotten to that box until I was 65.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dec45f616c35cba0603876502c5deff94c51a5/0_39_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1d4893d0a7a2d0b2a5a64e0a06f73a38","title":"covid 19 vaccine safety message vitally important uk health chief says","story":"Vaccine safety message ‘vitally important’, head of medicines regulator tells Andrew Marr ShowPublic health messaging that people can have faith in the safety of coronavirus vaccines is “vitally important”, the leader of the body that has approved the Pfizer jab has said.Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said of the Pfizer treatment that there “should be no doubt whatever that this is a very safe and highly effective vaccine”.Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show about how important the public health message is to make sure that people actually take the vaccine, she said: “It’s vitally important. And I would really like to emphasise that the highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards.”Raine said she expected the first people to be given the vaccine within days. “It will help us turn the corner,” she said. “There’s really not one of us who hasn’t been affected by this pandemic, and our organisation, like every other, has been completely focused on doing our job to be able to help defeat this terrible disease.”Raine, 67, who has had a 35-year career in public health, became chief executive of the UK’s medical regulator last year. The final decision on approval of the other vaccines that it is hoped will be put into general use will also rest with the body.She used her appearance on the Marr programme to emphasise the high safety standards being applied to the vaccine rollout. Last week, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to suggest the UK had rushed the approval of the Pfizer vaccine and did not review data as carefully as did American regulators. He later apologised and said he “did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way”.On Sunday, Raine said the process of monitoring safety would continue, with scrutiny of the vaccine’s use in practice.“It’s continuous, it’s real time, and we’ll be sharing any new information that comes to light,” she said. “But my overall message is that the safety profile of the Covid-19 vaccine is really no different from any other vaccine – might have a mild symptom, it will probably disappear in a day or two, and nothing at all of a serious nature, so you can be confident there.”She also said that anyone having a flu jab should do so before having the coronavirus vaccine.Raine was speaking after reports in Sunday newspapers that the Queen would be taking the Pfizer vaccine within weeks and would make it public after she had done so. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the claims.After Marr referred to the reports, she said: “I think that news that you’ve just given us is humbling, and it’s everything that we’re here to do at the MHRA.“We’re a public health organisation, we work as full partners, if I can say, in the public health family, and our goal is totally to protect every member of the population, Her Majesty of course, as well.”Raine was also asked about when the MHRA would approve the breaking up of the vaccine packs into smaller batches for care homes.She told Marr: “We have approved how the vaccine can be put into the small packs, but obviously what we’re doing is giving advice and guidance on how well, carefully, that is done.“It’s a special vaccine, it does need to be kept very cold, and then when the larger packs are split into smaller ones to go to where they will be given, that does need to be done very carefully.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33645b7705b6f851bdc90239c475c34aec1927b8/0_118_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=272273e0a09d39a12918d4503569dc15","title":"scottie pippen the last dance michael jordan chicago bulls faces of 2020","story":"The ex-Chicago Bulls star won new fans in the acclaimed Netflix documentary.

Was that the case?Yeah, that relationship, we established that we felt like that in the late 80s, playing against the Pistons, just starting to grow and mature and have each other’s backs. We grew up together and we defended each other. That respect we had on the court, that competitiveness we took through to the top – it was special. That was the respect we had for each other, because we had to be on the court to do what we did. We had to be dominant.Have you spoken to him about your opinion of series?Yeah. I told him I wasn’t too pleased with it. He accepted it. He said, “hey, you’re right”. That was pretty much it.It took a lot of effort and commitment to be a top basketball player. Was it a relief to retire?Yeah, that was pretty much it for me. I had put so much of my life into the game, from back in high school and having to catch up physically, and always feeling I had to prove myself. I think there was some gratifications throughout my career but I had back problems throughout my time and I had to try and keep on top of that.Owing to a contractual anomaly, you were not well paid compared to your teammates. Was that difficult?I think at the time there were moments when it was upsetting but also there was so much joy that rose among the pain that I was feeling. There was too much to celebrate and enjoy to be thinking about the negative side of it.What was it like looking back at incidents from so long ago, like the time you refused to play and sat out the rest of a match?I kind of let all that stuff go to the past. I didn’t get behind the documentary and try to promote it, talk about any incident that might have happened in the documentary. I didn’t feel I needed to bring back things that happened 20 years ago.Did you ever get nervous before a big game?No. I would say I would get more energised than nervous. I think I had been through situations before which meant I didn’t feel any nervousness. We felt like we were the ones being hunted. At that point I think you’re playing with what I call confidence. Maybe even a little bit of arrogance. You feel like you’re at the top.This has been a dramatic year for America, with Covid, Black Lives Matter and the election. How have those events affected you?A lot of things have happened this year that have really opened up issues that have been covered up and thrown in a corner. I think it’s opened everybody’s eyes, not just in America but all over the world, as to the equality that America lacks. And I think that our president has put us on a stage of embarrassment.What would you have done if you were a player now?You have to make a stand and that’s what the players are doing now. They’re showing they’re unified. I think that would have been the same case had I been a part of the game today. That’s what the Players’ Association is about. It’s great that their voices have been heard.Basketball has been played without crowds this year. Less pressure but less motivation. Is it easier or more difficult to play without an audience?I think it’s easier to play. I played pick-up games in empty gyms for a long time and I think that’s what the NBA turned into last season. Everybody making shots when you’re in the gym and no fans there. Everything goes up as far as the percentages of shooting the basketball. And that’s what we saw last season. From a business standpoint it allows the game to continue, but from a statistical category, if the game stays like that, these guys are going to eat up the record books.So is the characteristic that marks out the truly great players the ability to perform under pressure of the crowds?Well I think it has to be a high-skill level but yeah the players need to be able to perform when the pressure is on. But you know players perform differently in late game situations when the pressure is on. Not every player has to play the role of a Kobe Bryant or a Michael Jordan. Look at how LeBron finishes games. He puts a lot of pressure on defences himself, creating a lot of opportunities for other people. That’s what he’s able to do. He can dominate a game late without even scoring.Last week Diego Maradona died. He struggled with fame and adulation. Did you miss the cheering crowds and did you feel the need to replace that hit with something else?I was cool with it because I never heard the noise, if I can say that. I played for my team and to make it fun for those guys out on the court. I didn’t really give a crap about what people thought about how I played. When I walked off the court and the cheers went away, I was fine with it. I didn’t care to have people chanting for me. I wanted to have my own privacy. I wanted to not be that basketball player when I’m sitting in a restaurant.Did you miss the competition? Do you feel a need to replace it.I can say no, I don’t have to replace it. I can’t replace basketball. I can find things to fill a void in my life, to take up some time. I play golf, I still work out. But what I did in terms of my competitiveness – how can you keep that fire going? I can’t keep it going. Because it was not only me competing with you on the court but I was competing with you off the court. I felt like I was built stronger and more durable. It’s about being the last man standing at the end of the day.What are your work plans for the future?I don’t have many. I still work with ESPN and that’s pretty much it. Just kind of sitting back. I’ve got a son who plays at Vanderbilt University and two in high school. I’m kind of enjoying watching them grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd46ffed6db6f1fc0857ddbd66b76a4b15a30ce4/0_428_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f163460b8bb97cffa8c87891119da3ce","title":"densely packed bame communities in england bear brunt of covid 19","story":"Ethnically erse areas suffer up to four times more infections than mostly white neighbourhoods close bySome of England’s most ethnically erse areas have suffered up to four times more coronavirus infections than mostly white neighbourhoods only a few miles away, a  analysis reveals, as health experts said the UK had paid the price for failing to tackle structural racism.A study of England’s 10 worst-hit council areas found huge disparities in the effect of Covid-19 on residents living alongside one another, with densely packed Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities bearing the brunt of the pandemic.Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service and chair of the 2070 commission into city and regional inequalities in the UK, said the findings proved “Covid has not been a leveller. Nor has the economic fallout been a leveller.”He called on the government to “get behind a proper examination of the issues of how Covid has impacted on inequality, particularly on the delivery of their levelling up agenda” and added: “It’s made the task harder of levelling up but also made it more urgent. And the truth is, we don’t have a levelling up plan from the government, we don’t have a cabinet minister … we simply don’t have a level of leadership with this agenda.”The link between deprivation, ethnicity and an increased risk from Covid-19 has been well established, with black African men nearly four times more likely to die from the disease than white men, according to the UK’s Office for National Statistics. analysis shows for the first time how these disparities exist even among communities living side by side. It drills down to more than 300 neighbourhoods comprising nearly 2.7 million people in England’s 10 local authorities with the highest infection rates, almost all of which are post-industrial towns in the north-west.It found that across England, average salary was likely to indicate an area’s infection rate, meaning places with higher average earnings were more likely to have fewer Covid-19 cases. But in the 10 worst-hit local authorities, an area’s proportion of BAME residents had a stronger correlation to its case rate, compared with salary, age and deprivation.In these 10 worst-hit councils, the 26 areas with a majority of BAME residents and an average salary of below £25,000 had experienced 7.1 cases per 100 people. This is almost double the average rate in the 22 mostly white areas where most people earn more than £35,000 a year.Tim Elwell-Sutton, an assistant director of the Health Foundation, described the findings as “very stark”: “You’re seeing areas right next to each other having very different experiences of the pandemic and that bring things home.”Residents from a BAME background are more likely to live in cramped housing with several generations under one roof, working in public-facing jobs in healthcare, hospitality or warehouses, and are more likely to use public transport, experts have said, increasing their exposure to Covid-19.“At least in part, these factors are a consequence of structural racism and it has left ethnic minorities more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic and could have been predicted,” said Elwell-Sutton.He urged ministers to put health inequalities at the heart of the government’s levelling up agenda, arguing that the focus on infrastructure and the economy risked leaving structural issues as “the preserve of the Department of Health”.He added: “If we’d been healthier at the start of the pandemic we would have done much better and particularly if that gap between the most and least deprived wasn’t as big then we would have found it easier to weather this.”Kerslake said the government needed to invest not only in infrastructure but also skills and combating deprivation, and properly fund local authorities to rebuild public health capacity. “If you were to pick out one thing that left us much more vulnerable to this pandemic it has been the denuding of resources for public health and local authorities,” he said. A failure to do so posed a “real risk” that existing health inequalities would widen, he warned.ProfDominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said his area had suffered a “double whammy pandemic effect”, which he said was worsening the health and economic costs.Residents and businesses urgently needed more financial help from the Treasury, he said, adding that more deprived areas to be prioritised for the vaccine when it is rolled out more widely early next year. He called for a longer-term plan to move new middle class jobs to struggling northern towns post-Brexit.“The inequalities revealed by this analysis absolutely confirm our own local analysis,” he said.“We have higher Covid rates due to higher structural risks, so we risk being in tier 3 for longer, possibly months, and so our local economy is massively more impacted. This increases deprivation which is itself a major driver of higher rates of Covid-19 transmission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b99d5308c3b18527aff5484cbf25a682e6d640/0_267_3999_2399/master/3999.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eef111c802dd109edbb4759f3181ecbc","title":"stronger together taiwan foreign minister urges new alliance against china","story":"Joseph Wu says Beijing is seeking to expand its ‘authoritarian order’ and calls for ‘like-minded’ nations to act together to protect TaiwanThe international community must join together in resisting China’s expansionism and preventing an invasion of Taiwan by sharing intelligence, rethinking Chinese business ties and boosting Taipei’s presence on the world stage, Taiwan’s foreign minister has said.In an interview with the , Joseph Wu said China’s activities in the South China and East China seas, its border skirmishes with India, and its crackdown on Hong Kong were evidence of it seeking to “expand its authoritarian order”, and that Taiwan was its next target.Wu warned partners including the US, Europe, Japan and Australia, that if Taiwan were to “fall prey to China” it would greatly expand Beijing’s reach into the Pacific region and significantly impact the world order.As foreign minister, Wu has been at the forefront of Taiwan’s lobbying campaign for international “like-minded” alliances. In the ornate meeting room of Taipei’s foreign ministry, he spoke optimistically about what he hoped other nations might offer, but was careful not to cross into requests for direct military assistance, which could inflame the precarious stability of the Taiwan Strait. However, he did not shy away from criticising Beijing, saying its imposition of “authoritarian, even totalitarian rule” threatened to turn even its own people against it.Despite the Chinese Communist party never having ruled Taiwan, Beijing considers it to be a breakaway province that must be brought back to the motherland, by force if necessary. It has dramatically built up its military capabilities, increased aerial incursions and military drills, and sharpened its rhetoric against Taipei and the US for its support of Taiwan. In October China’s president, Xi Jinping, told troops to prepare for war.Chinese control of Taiwan would significantly boost Beijing’s regional control and access to the Pacific region.“If one of the most critical junctures of the first island chain is not in the hands of the like-minded countries, we can imagine what this is going to create in the global strategic picture,” Wu said, referencing McCarthy-era fears of China’s navy reaching the US west coast. “We definitely need to think about how we prevent it from happening.”“The like-minded countries need to come together, and we will be stronger together,” he said.He said Taiwan would “appreciate” intelligence information sharing and other non-military forms of support from other allies including Australia and Japan. Taiwan was working domestically against disinformation campaigns and infiltration, but also sought international partners on hybrid warfare and security cooperation.Wu said Taiwan wanted to show the international community and China that it was “absolutely determined to defend ourselves”, and that it had the responsibility, will and capability.Taiwan is hugely outgunned by China. It has made major commitments to boost its defence capabilities and improve the state of its infantry, but relies on billions of dollars in arms sales from the US.Under a decades-old agreement the US is obliged to provide Taiwan with necessary defensive materials, but it also maintains a deterrence policy of refusing to say if it would come to Taiwan’s defence in the case of an attack. Under the Trump administration sales increased and requests were fast-tracked, something Wu said he believes will continue.“Considering that China may want to launch an attack a couple … or several years down the road in a more massive way, we need to procure more items from the United States,” he said.Analysts have pointed to China’s military buildup and growing belligerence under the leadership of Xi Jinping, as well as its deepening hostilities with the US – a key party in cross-strait relations – to say a confrontation is growing more likely.“We cannot assume that China will attack Taiwan or will not attack Taiwan, in what period of time,” Wu said. “But if we look at the Chinese preparation in the last couple of years, they have certainly intensified their military deployment against Taiwan, and also intensified their exercises around Taiwan,” he said.In recent months China has ramped up its incursions into Taiwan’s air identification zone (AIDZ), to near-daily flights of military jets and spy planes, according to Taiwan’s defence monitors. Each time Taiwan scrambles its own jets in response, causing wear and tear on the fleet as well as giving China’s People’s Liberation Army information about its tactics. The PLA has also repeatedly crossed the median line, which had until this year represented the status quo on maintaining peace and stability in the strait, Wu said.Taiwan’s multi-pronged defence strategies are preparing for a variety of Chinese moves including cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, disinformation campaigns, infiltration, large scale military assaults, a Crimea-style annexation of outlying islands, “grey zone” precursors to war, or a combination of them all.What Taiwan really needed, Wu said, was more support in rejoining international bodies. Few countries formally recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and despite China’s increasing isolation on the world stage, it still wields enough power and influence to keep Taiwan out of international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite growing calls for its inclusion, Taiwan has not garnered enough support for its admission to the WHO’s assembly.“We want the international community to understand that excluding 23.5 million people here in Taiwan is definitely not fair to the Taiwanese people, and also, excluding Taiwanese people from participating in the World Health Organization is also not fair to the rest of the international community,” he said, saying Taiwan had plenty to share about its successful pandemic response.Wu also pointed to other modes of action other governments could take in resisting Beijing’s advances and supporting Taiwan, including rethinking trades.However he acknowledged this often came at a cost, noting China’s willingness to restrict or sanction imports as a dispute tactic, most recently shown with its ban on Australian coal and tariffs on its wine. But this, he said, was when international alliances were most needed. “Fighting alone is not the way to deal with it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/543d8c3458e4a3d8788dec7b563eec59abd05f13/0_164_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=747d42279de47022c426f9188ca510b9","title":"coronavirus live news giuliani tests positive for covid california braces for lockdown","story":"California confirmed record new cases on Sunday South Korea expands testing amid case surge Biden picks California Attorney General Becerra to lead pandemic responseIt’s back to school today for some New York City schoolchildren, weeks after the schools were closed to in-person learning because of rising Covid-19 infections.The city’s public school system, which shut down in-person learning earlier this month, will bring back preschool students and children in kindergarten through fifth grade, whose parents chose a mix of in-school and remote learning. Special education students in all grades who have particularly complex needs will be welcomed back starting Thursday.Middle school and high school will remain all remote at least until after the holiday break, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said.We have facts now for two straight months of extraordinarily low levels of transmission in our schools, our schools are clearly safer. This is what our health care leaders say. Our schools are safer than pretty much any place else in New York City. So, I really think everyone in the school community can feel secure because so many measures are in place to protect everyone.De Blasio announced on 29 November that school buildings serving younger children and special-needs students would reopen with coronavirus testing increased from monthly to weekly. Masks and social distancing are required at all city schools.About 190,000 students will be eligible to return to school buildings starting today. After closing schools in March, New York City was one of the first large US cities to reopen school buildings in September, but the majority of parents chose online-only learning for their children.Children whose parents chose the hybrid model were previously inside physical classrooms from one to three days a week, but de Blasio said some students will now be in their school buildings five days a week.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along – and stay tuned for the latest with my colleague Haroon Siddique. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Some of England’s most ethnically erse areas have suffered up to four times more coronavirus infections than mostly white neighbourhoods only a few miles away, a  analysis reveals, as health experts said the UK had paid the price for failing to tackle structural racism.A study of England’s 10 worst-hit council areas found huge disparities in the effect of Covid-19 on residents living alongside one another, with densely packed Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities bearing the brunt of the pandemic.The World Health Organization is holding discussions on Monday about the feasibility of trials in which healthy young volunteers are deliberately infected with coronavirus to hasten vaccine development – amid questions over whether they should go ahead given the promising data from the frontrunner vaccine candidates.Some scientists have reservations about exposing volunteers to a virus for which there is no cure, although there are treatments that can help patients. However, proponents argue that the risks of Covid-19 to the young and healthy are minimal, and the benefits to society are high: Indonesia received its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine from China on Sunday, President Joko Widodo said, as the government prepares a mass inoculation programme. The vaccine still needs to be evaluated by the country’s food and drug agency while his administration prepares to distribute it across the vast archipelago of 270 million people, Jokowi said.Britain is set to administer the first doses of the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, with the NHS giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents, Reuters reports. The PfizerBioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge. For that reason, it will first be administered in 50 hospitals. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week.Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people, AP reports. Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a US meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there.However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.A plea from Dr. Anthony Fauci for people to “wear a mask” to slow the spread of the coronavirus tops a Yale Law School librarian’s list of the most notable quotes of 2020.The list assembled by Fred Shapiro, an associate director at the library, is an annual update to “The Yale Book of Quotations,” which was first published in 2006, AP reports. Also on the list is “I can’t breathe,” the plea George Floyd made repeatedly to police officers holding him down on a Minneapolis street corner. Several quotes from the presidential campaign appear including Joe Biden telling a student: “You’re a lying dog-faced pony soldier.”Shapiro said he picks quotes that are not necessarily admirable or eloquent, but rather because they are famous or particularly revealing of the spirit of the times.In case you missed this earlier: Jerrold M Post, a psychiatrist who profiled dictators for the CIA and who declared Donald Trump a “dangerous, destructive charismatic leader”, has died of Covid-19. He was 86.A pioneer in his field, Post’s assessments of leaders such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi and Kim Jong-il helped guide presidents and other US officials.He brought his work closer to home in his final years, assessing Trump’s rise to power and his relationship with his followers, thoughts he published in book form in late 2019. In an interview at the time, Post accurately predicted the aftermath of Trump’s election defeat: China reported 15 new Covid-19 cases on Dec. 6, down from 18 cases a day earlier, the national health authority said on Monday.The National Health Commission said in a statement 12 of the new cases were imported infections originating from overseas. Three locally transmitted infections were reported in the Inner Mongolia region.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to six from two cases a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 86,634, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.South Korea reported 615 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said, capping a month of triple-digit daily increases that have driven the nation’s largest wave of infections in nine months.Monday’s total was down slightly from Sunday, when the agency reported 631 new cases, the largest daily tally since a peak in February and early March.On Sunday authorities said they will impose heightened social distancing rules for the capital Seoul and surrounding areas that will last until at least the end of the month.South Korea avoided lockdowns but used an intensive system of tracing, testing and quarantining to tamp down two earlier waves of infection.With this third wave, however, the government has faced increasing criticism as cases continue to rise despite unprecedented measures such as mask mandates, curfews for restaurants and other restrictions.In total, South Korea has reported 38,161 cases, with 549 deaths.Health authorities have said that if the current trend of cases continues, the hospital system could become overloaded. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that the Arizona state legislature will close for the whole of this coming week, “after at least 15 current or future Republican legislators may have been directly exposed to Covid-19 by meeting with Rudy Giuliani.” The decision seems to contradict a statement released earlier by the Trump campaign, saying Giuliani no legislators or members of the press were on Giuliani’s contact tracing list because he had tested negative and not experienced symptoms until at least 48 hours after meeting with any of them. According to the Arizona Capitol Times: Several lawmakers who attended the unofficial hearing on 30 November also attended the Legislature’s new member orientation later in the week, potentially exposing even more lawmakers and many state government employees. Nguyen, Burges and Rogers were at both events. Sen. Andrea Dalessandro, D-Sahuarita, said she’s making plans to take a test Wednesday after learning that several of the GOP legislators she attended the orientation with had spent time with Giuliani. Mexico’s Health Ministry on Sunday reported 7,455 new cases of coronavirus infection and an additional 261 fatalities, bringing the country’s totals to 1,175,850 cases and 109,717 deaths.The government says the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Japan is preparing to send nurses from the Self-Defence Forces to Osaka and Hokkaido to help treat a surge in coronavirus infections as soon as the two prefecture governments request it, chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said on Monday.Kyodo News reported that Japan’s northern Hokkaido prefecture was planning to ask the government to send Self-Defense Force nurses. The prefecture has seen infection clusters at two hospitals, Kyodo said.In western Japan’s Osaka, the local government said on Sunday that daily new cases had exceeded 300 for the sixth straight day, according to public broadcaster NHK.The Serum Institute of India has sought emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator for AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday, according to several reports in Indian media, citing the Press Trust of India.It applied to the Drugs Controller General of India, citing unmet medical needs due to the pandemic and in the interest of the public at large, the agency report said, citing official sources.The Serum Institute was not immediately available to Reuters request for comment.More on Japan’s prime minister now: Suga has defended his support for Go To Travel and the Olympics, which could see “large-scale” numbers of sports fans arriving in Tokyo from overseas, including those who have not been vaccinated. Suga, who became prime minister in September after Shinzo Abe resigned on health grounds, said the government was tackling the latest surge in Covid-19 infections with a “strong sense of crisis”.“Protecting the lives and livelihoods of the people is my administration’s top priority,” Suga, who did not hold a single press conference in November, told reporters on Friday.Earlier, in a pre-recorded address to a US general assembly session on the pandemic, he insisted the Tokyo Games would be “proof that humanity had defeated the pandemic,” adding, “I will continue to spare no effort to bring about a Games that are safe and secure”.South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday ordered testing for the new coronavirus to be expanded by mobilizing the military and more people from the public service, as the country continued to report triple-digit daily new cases, Reuters reports. Moon said testing sites should operate longer hours to allow people working to get tested at their convenience and more drive-through testing facilities should be set up, presidential Blue House spokesman Chung Man-ho told a briefing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses.

The campus can handle up to 2.5 million parcels a week. Video: Bryan O’Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTina Tulley, manager at the An Post Dublin Parcel Hub in Dublin 12. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienSomeone in Lucan is getting an electric scooter for Christmas. It arrived by ship from Poland early on Thursday morning and found its way to An Post’s mail centre campus – two large warehouses near Ballymount, west Dublin, where 3.3 million packages are now being sorted and sent every week.Over the next 24 hours, the scooter in its packaging will be unloaded, wind its way along a complex carousel system and be placed inside another truck and brought to the Parkwest staging centre before finally arriving at a front-door destination some time on Friday morning.It is the journey of just one parcel. But take your eye off it for a split second and it becomes lost in a sea of brown and white cardboard, countless thousands of tonnes of which are trundling through the postal system in the build-up to a Christmas that, due to the pandemic, is more reliant on postal delivery than ever before.On a steel gantry overlooking the sprawling machinery (An Post has invested €30 million in its “ecommerce campus”), floor operations manager Maurice Ebbs (51) is as enthusiastic about the process as the children will be about the presents on Christmas morning.“There has been unbelievable change,” he says. “The volumes in the last couple of years it’s probably more than trebled.”He knows all about change. As a 16-year-old junior postman in the mid-1980s, he started out delivering telegrams from the back of a motorbike.In many ways that encapsulates where An Post is today – with letters ever dwindling, growing volumes of smaller consumer packages, ordered online, represent the future. At the mail centre, they funnel by at high speed around a spaghetti junction of conveyor belts, scanners and bins that fill much of the 45,000sq ft of noisy warehouse space.As Ebbs mentions, this year’s weekly seasonal throughput is more than triple the previous record of one million packages set last year.A quick glimpse among the huge pallets and boxes reveals Christmas gifts and deliveries from the likes of Zara, Arnotts, Hampers \u0026amp Co, and HP Nutrition. Amazon arrows are omnipresent. A vast array of random consumer goods – everything from guitars and bags of barbecue coals to surfboards and trampolines – fill two kilometres worth of trucks, back to back, on a daily basis.Things “start” at 7am but never really stop – there is just a two-hour window for machine maintenance.Full trucksRoss Tredt (36), a process area manager who oversees the trucks, says there has been “no let-up” through the pandemic. The trucks he oversees reverse up and pull away every 20-30 minutes, each holding 2,000-5,000 packages. They never stop.Does he dream about parcels? “Nightmares! It’s just been non-stop.”But the pandemic has been a tale of two postal systems for chief executive David McRedmond.“The really good news, though, is strategically it’s moved us forward about two or three years. We were going to go through this gradual decline in letters and gradual increase in parcels instead you have just seen a jump – like that. So we are now really operating where we would have expected to operate in, say, 2023.”All around him the shiny new machines are purring and wheezing to keep up with this abrupt fast-forward. From the trucks, parcels are fed on to a series of connecting conveyor belts, slowed and evenly spaced by human hands before being funnelled through a scanner, which records the barcodes, and then tipped into destination-specific bins.These in turn are loaded on to yet more trucks and dispatched to 113 delivery depots around the country. Much of the process is automated, a far cry from the human handling of 10 years ago that would, says director of international mail Cyril McGrane, have potentially added another 24 hours to delivery times.Today they process up to 12,000 parcels an hour – compared with 1,000 in the manual days – which on Wednesday alone added up to a total of 167,000.“It’s mind-blowing scale change,” says McGrane, who predicts the surge in activity will last well into the January sales.Fish gutsIt is not all pristine Amazon packages and square boxes. Paula Robinson and Donna Nolan work in the international section, unloading the one or two trucks that arrive from the airport at 6am each morning.They work closely with customs officers and have encountered everything from second-hand clothes to “bush meat”, fish guts and any manner of rotten food products that “ooze out” and destroy neighbouring parcels.“Some days we have to go home and fumigate ourselves,” Paula laughs, although like everyone else they describe their job with a certain affection. Even bizarre Christmas gifts have a home to reach.Over the next year An Post plans to adapt its systems for ever more efficiency, moving the emphasis further away from letters. But McRedmond is keen to bring the public along, and savvy PR moves during the pandemic have helped (the idea of distributing five million free postcards last March was based on similar St Patrick’s Day versions once gifted by Senator Feargal Quinn).“We became very motivated by really being a front line in the pandemic, and in relation to how people think about An Post, I think it has changed it,” he says.But will the old romanticism of the village postman delivering letters be pushed aside by a tide of ruthless automated efficiency? “I think we want to achieve both,” McRedmond replies.“It’s a really important part of what An Post is, that human connection. So we’ll always have postmen and postwomen, we will always have them.“But they’ll now be in an electric van they’ll now be calling at different times of the day they’ll now be on slightly different routes. So, yes, there will be changes but for the consumer, for the person living at home, they’ll still know their postman or postwoman. That’s really important but the whole system behind them will be completely different.”"},{"url":null,"title":"class gap more affluent students dominate high points courses","story":"The class gap in higher education is revealed in new figures that show affluent students dominate high-points courses such as medicine, finance and engineering.By contrast, students from disadvantaged areas are more likely to study courses in areas such as childcare, sport and secretarial studies.The findings are contained in new research by the Higher Education Authority (HEA), which examines the socio-economic profile of tens of thousands of students attending universities and institutes of technology.The study also reveals striking contrasts in the profile of students attending inidual third-level institutions.Trinity College Dublin has the highest proportion of students from affluent areas (36 per cent) and the lowest proportion of disadvantaged students (5 per cent).It is followed closely behind by other Dublin institutes, including the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and UCD.By contrast, Letterkenny Institute of Technology has the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged areas (25 per cent).In general, institutes of technology were more likely to represent the local community in their student intake, while there was a more affluent student profile in the university sector.Using the new data, colleges will be rewarded with additional public funding if they admit more disadvantaged students.This year, for example, colleges received about €42 million for measures to support students from target groups to access and participate in higher education.Overall, across the higher education system, students from affluent backgrounds are over-represented while students from disadvantaged backgrounds are under-represented.This class gap is likely to raise questions over whether our system of grants and access schemes is generous enough to support students from worse-off backgrounds into higher education.The findings are based on deprivation index scores, which measure the relative affluence or disadvantage of a student’s home address.The report covers all publicly funded higher-education institutions for the first time and 94 per cent of third-level students.Lack of ersityDr Alan Wall, the authority’s chief executive, said the figures showed the higher-education student population did not yet reflect the ersity found in the rest of the population in Ireland.“This detailed data set provides policy makers and institutions with a comprehensive knowledge of patterns of access and disadvantage that will assist them in developing and implementing targeted approaches to advancing equity of access,” he said.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said it was his ambition to ensure third-level education was accessible to everyone, regardless of age, race, geography or gender.“In order to achieve that aim, we must ensure that our policies strengthen the participation of students in higher education, and to do that we need accurate data and evidence,” he said.He has announced a review of the Susi grants scheme and is planning a series of new targets in a new National Access Plan, which aims to boost the number of under-represented groups at third level.The HEA’s head of access policy, Caitríona Ryan, cautioned against comparing inidual colleges against each other because each institution serves a unique region.For example, Donegal is categorised as the most disadvantaged county in the State, while parts of Dublin are among the most affluent areas nationwide.She said all colleges had access initiatives in place to boost the numbers of disadvantaged and under-represented groups, such as students from the Travelling community, students with disabilities and first-time mature students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429082.1607276373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how can the class gap in higher education be bridged","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Hernandez, president of Letterkenny Institute of Technology student union. Photograph: Joe DunneOn any given day, Mary Hernandez sees the financial struggles facing students at Letterkenny Institute of Technology (LYIT) up close.“Huge numbers here are on Susi grants, but many are just outside the limit to get them and find it very difficult,” says Hernandez, president of LYIT’s students union.“You have students who don’t have digital devices or don’t have wifi at home, or can’t afford to get to college by bus or car.”Based on the findings of a new study by the Higher Education Authority, LYIT has – by some distance – the highest proportion of disadvantaged students in the State.Some 25 per cent of the 5,000 students at LYIT are categorised as disadvantaged based on their home address just 3 per cent are categorised as affluent.This compares with a national average across the higher education sector of 10 per cent who are disadvantaged and 20 per cent who are affluent.LYIT also has the highest proportion of students reliant on grant aid, and the lowest average household income (€35,800 compared with a national average of about €50,000).About 250km away in Dublin, the picture – in many respects – is very different.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has one of the highest concentrations of students from well-off areas.A third of its Irish students are categorised as affluent (33 per cent), while a small minority are categorised as disadvantaged (5 per cent).It has one of the lowest proportion of students in receipt of Susi grants and one of the highest average household incomes (€55,000).These figures exclude international students, who account for about 60 per cent of graduates and whose annual fees can cost up to €56,000 a year to study medicine.Struggling studentsAlthough fewer students are in receipt of grant aid, many still struggle, says Anna Whitaker, welfare officer with RCSI students union committee. High Dublin rents are a major burden, she says, while part-time jobs are few and far between this year.“Many students find themselves ineligible for the jobseeker’s allowance or the pandemic unemployment payment, while others have chronic conditions or are sharing a household with or caring for at-risk family members.”RCSI points out that it offers a number of initiatives to support school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds.About 12 per cent of CAO places in pharmacy, physiotherapy and medicine are made available on reduced points to eligible students through special access routes.The Higher Education Authority’s head of access policy, Caitríona Ryan, cautions against comparing inidual colleges against each other on the basis that each institution serves a unique region.For example, Donegal is categorised as the most disadvantaged county in the State, while parts of Dublin are among the most affluent areas nationwide.However, the HEA’s new report points to one over-arching finding: the higher education system does not reflect wider society.Disadvantaged students are under-represented, while advantaged students over over-represented. In other words, students from well-off families are much more likely to progress to higher education than others.Overall, about 15 per cent of the population in Ireland is defined as “affluent”.Within higher education, the proportion of students from this background is 20 per cent. And within prestige courses such as medicine, finance and engineering, this rises to 35 per cent.By contrast, about 15 per cent of the population nationally is defined as “disadvantaged”. This falls to 10 per cent within the higher-education student body, and plummets to just 3.5 per cent within university courses such as medicine.Disadvantaged students are more likely to study courses in childcare, youth services and sports, which have lower points requirements.These figures show that well-off families still have a firm grip on university places, despite the rapid expansion of higher education and the introduction of “fee-free education” more than two decades ago.Bridging the gapSo, what can be done to bridge the gap? Is the cost of college a major barrier? And are access initiatives simply tinkering around the edges of a problem that has existed for decades?There are a variety of access schemes for students from disadvantaged backgrounds or with disabilities that provide lower points entry routes into college.However, most experts acknowledge that the work involved in boosting access to third level among under-represented groups needs to start as early as primary school.They say it means building stronger links between schools and colleges, along with raising expectations among pupils that third level is for them, even if no one in their family has never progressed beyond second level.Financial barriers are also daunting. While about 40 per cent of the student population receive grant aid from Susi, student leaders and access officers have repeatedly pointed out that the financial support does not come near to covering the costs of going to third level.For example, the latest research shows the cost of going to college away from home is about €12,000 a year.The Technological Higher Education Association says students from disadvantaged backgrounds require significant extra supports in order to enable them to progress through to completion of their programme.Given that institutes of technology are leaders in driving access to higher education, Dr Joseph Ryan, chief executive of the association, says it is only right that they should receive additional core funding to reflect this.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris says one of his key ambitions is to ensure third-level education is accessible to everyone, regardless of age, race, geography or gender. It is a noble sentiment but he will be judged on outcomes over the coming years."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Irish Wind Energy Association says single biggest barrier to development is Ireland\u0026rsquos electricity transmission gridPanda facility is due to be running by end of 2021 and will process up to one billion plastic bottles a yearEU\u0026rsquos largest producer agreed last year to one of world\u0026rsquos most ambitious climate targets"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429171.1607283605!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kerry employer builds homes to help and retain staff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Wójs family from Castleisland outside their new house built in a not-for-profit initiative by Marcin’s  employer Walsh Colour Print. Photograph: Domnick WalshSt Nicholas’ Day, on December 6th, is when Polish children get a visit from a certain white-bearded, red-robed figure. And if they are good, the original Santa brings small gifts and treats.This Sunday, one Polish family living in Co Kerry was celebrating a somewhat larger handover – as they took ownership of their own home after a 16-year wait.A national company that includes the educational title Educate.ie, Walsh Colour Print was established in 1991 in the small Kerry town synonymous with the late Con Houlihan and a great rugby and athletics tradition.In 2017, the company embarked on the groundbreaking project to enable employees to own their own homes in an effort to provide security for its staff as well as to attract and retain workers.The houses in small blocks are A-rated, with air-to-water heating, and come in at the not-for-profit price of €150,000 – the price signalled by Tony and Patricia Walsh three years ago when they began the project.Family struggleThe first three have been finished, with another 17 under construction.Mr Wójs was the catalyst for the project, Mr Walsh explained. A fork lift driver who had been working with the company for 12 years, he told the company of the family’s struggle to find their own home and how it was getting them down.“Our worry was what was going to happen him when he’s 65 and renting all those years,” Mr Walsh said.The Wójs were “trapped “ earning too much to qualify for social housing and not able to reach the mortgage for houses in Kerry. At the same time the cost of rent is hefty and prices are continuing to rise.Anyone working for the company will now have the opportunity to own their own home and the mortgage repayments will be less than the rental, Mr Walsh said.“We hope this will give us the edge, in retaining our workforce and also in recruiting new people,” he added.Ten-year scheme“The houses are fully owned by our employees. Employees have to work with the company for 10 years and after that they are free to sell without any penalty.”Mr Wójs’s wife Anna, who is working with Educate.ie, said the couple were so frustrated at paying rents of €900-€1,000 a month they considered leaving Ireland. “Lots of friends moved back to Poland two and three years ago,” she said.Owning their own home “means a lot”, she said. Two years ago, they had to move from the house they had been renting for six years before Christmas because it was being sold.“Now we have a house, we feel better,” she said. “My daughter can have her own room. I can have my kitchen. Mine! It’s like a Christmas present!”In all there is planning for 70 houses and creche facilities on the company-owned land at Bawnluskaha just outside the town.

Three of the deportations were ordered before March.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee told Independent TD Catherine Connolly in a parliamentary reply two weeks ago that 469 deportation orders were issued since the outbreak of the virus in March up to the end of October.Of the total, 200 deportation orders were issued in March, but none for the following four months from April to July. They recommenced in August, when 134 orders were issued, along with 35 in September and 100 in October, the last month for which figures are available.Ms McEntee said her department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau, which has responsibility for deportations, “are taking a pragmatic approach” to enforcement during the pandemic. “This is evidenced by the low number of deportations actually carried out during this time.”But Ms Higgins said that “rather than saying ambiguous things like ‘We’re pragmatic and it probably won’t happen’, they’d be better to give assurance that it won’t happen during this period of time”.“As long as we are in a state of emergency, we shouldn’t be deporting people or issuing them with deportation notices.”Sunset clauseThe legislation has a sunset clause, with the moratorium on deportations remaining in place for as long as the Government’s Covid emergency legislation remains in operation.Ms Higgins also claimed that people had shown up for deportation and were then not removed but would receive another notice to show up three months later.The department said that “persons who leave the State voluntarily preserve the right to enter the State at a later date, with a valid basis”.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said in the Dáil last month that he would not like to see anyone deported to countries badly affected by Covid-19 after the case of two Zimbabwean healthcare workers who faced deportation was raised.But Ms Ruane said “lots of countries are struggling with Covid because of what a volatile situation it is, even in Europe, where Belgium changed within a matter of weeks” from coping well with the virus to being overwhelmed.Since the start of the pandemic, the largest number of orders was issued to iniduals from Pakistan (105), followed by Brazil (54), Albania (49) and Georgia (39).It has also emerged that the department last June requested that a “dedicated testing pathway” for Covid-19 be established for people facing deportation.The department had requested the “exceptional and temporary arrangement” via the Department of Health, which then contacted HSE chief executive Paul Reid.Barrier to entryIn a letter sent to Mr Reid, Department of Health secretary general Jim Breslin said a number of countries required people entering to show proof they had tested negative for Covid-19.“This is creating a barrier to entry for some, including voluntary deportees,” said Mr Breslin in the letter, seen by The . “It would also pose a challenge should the State need to undertake an urgent deportation.”The Department of Justice is “keen to put a facility in place both to enable those wishing to voluntarily return to their country to do so and to enable any urgent deportations which are required”, he wrote. Given the “exceptional circumstances”, a “dedicated testing pathway for use by the Department of Justice” should be put in place, he added.A justice spokesman confirmed that “the need for testing asymptomatic iniduals” facing deportation had been discussed with the HSE but, given the low number of deportations during the pandemic, “there was no need to progress discussions any further”.The Department of Foreign Affairs also requested in June that the Department of Health put in place an arrangement for dedicated testing pathways for essential travel by its diplomatic staff travelling to embassies abroad.The Department of Health requested the HSE to introduce arrangements for a test certificate to be issued to each person concerned. The HSE agreed and said this was appropriate."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429231.1607289991!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in apologises to former student activist over her criticism of stanley","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChristine O’Mahony: she  said she left the party in light of the controversy surrounding Brian Stanley. Photograph: Crispin RodwellA former Sinn Féin student activist who was subject to intense party pressure after criticising a tweet by Brian Stanley has said party representatives have reached out and apologised for her treatment.Christine O’Mahony, a member of UCD Ógra Sinn Féin, resigned from the party after a Sinn Féin member called to her house to demand she delete tweets that were critical of the party.Ms O’Mahony, who was also told not to discuss internal issues in public, said on Sunday that both her local TD in Meath East Darren O’Rourke and the chair of the North Leinster cúige (district council) of the party had since made contact with her to say they were very sorry at what had happened to her, and that she had the right to stand up for her beliefs.Ms O’Mahony had criticised Mr Stanley for a 2017 tweet about Leo Varadkar which appeared to refer to the Fine Gael leader’s sexuality.Mr Stanley, who initially defended the comment before deleting his social media accounts late last week, had tweeted: “yippee 4 d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”Mr Ó Broin insisted Sinn Féin had very clear social media guidelines and policy, and where people make complaints “we follow up very vigorously”.He rejected a claim by Minister for Further Education Simon Harris that the party had sent in the “heavies” to Ms O”Mahony.Ms O’Mahony (22), a postgraduate student in human rights in UCD, told The  on Sunday she had no intention of rejoining the party. She said she had been concerned for some time that some Sinn Féin supporters on Twitter used homophobic language in their attacks on Mr Varadkar.She also said she was uncomfortable with the way in which some had defended comments made about Mr Varadkar by South Dublin county councillor Paddy Holohan.“In the last few days I have been accused of being a Fine Gael plant and being paid by Fine Gael to ruin the party. I am very critical of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. In the past I will even admit I have defended Sinn Féin when the party’s position seemed indefensible.”Legitimate criticismsThe LGBT officer of the Sinn Féin Ógra branch in UCD has also resigned over the matter. Seán Pender (19) said he had resigned in solidarity with Ms O’Mahony for making legitimate criticisms, not just over homophobic comments within Sinn Féin but over other issues.“It was the last straw. I saw that there was a relatively high percentage of Sinn Féin supporters who supported Donald Trump. I thought if I was in the party I could change that but you cannot change a party when the people attempting to change it are silenced.”A Sinn Féin spokesman said the people who went to Ms O’Mahony’s home and spoke to her parents were advised it “was not necessary and should not have happened”.Mr Stanley was asked by party leader Mary Lou McDonald to take a week off and is making a statement to the Dáil on December 15th.Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats will chair the Public Accounts Committee in his absence."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429240.1607292118!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit last push for trade deal as talks remain very difficult","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier arrives at Brussels Midi station after Brexit talks in London. Photograph: Kenzo TribouillardAFP via GettyNegotiators are locked in a final heave to find an agreement in Brussels on trade relations between the European Union and UK that will determine the fate of the Irish economy, with just a few weeks left to go.Talks were described as “very difficult” by those close to the negotiations, as the two teams, led by the EU’s Michel Barnier and the UK’s David Frost, made a last effort to bridge Britain’s desire to erge from EU standards and the bloc’s determination to protect its market.Member states have summoned Barnier to update them on the progress of the negotiations first thing on Monday morning, in the wake of warnings from some capitals that they could veto a compromise if it were to give Britain a permanent edge over their own domestic economies.In a move viewed as unhelpful by Brussels and Dublin, Boris Johnson will on Monday ask members of parliament to vote for controversial legislative clauses that would allow ministers to renege on the Brexit withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year.The House of Lords removed the clauses from the Internal Market Bill but environment secretary George Eustice said MPs should restore them.He told Sky News that the clauses were important as an insurance policy for Britain, particularly if the current negotiations were to end without a deal.“Where the joint committee process between the UK and the EU fails to come up with clarity about how the Northern Ireland protocol should be interpreted, it’s absolutely crucial that the UK government has the powers to provide legal clarity,” he said.Trust ‘undermined’Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said it would be “crazy” if the UK concluded a trade deal with the EU this week and then passed legislation that prevented it being ratified.“Flexing muscles in Westminster may play well in terms of domestic politics in the UK but I think it has undermined trust with the EU,” said the Minister.“I still think it is more likely than not that we will find a way to getting a deal done but I won’t be shocked if it falls apart,” Mr Coveney said en route to Brussels on Sunday night.Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Sunday put the chances of a deal at “50-50” but stressed “an agreement is in everyone’s best interests”.Asked about contingency planning around a no-deal, Mr Coveney said: “If we don’t get a deal in the next few days, then obviously there are very serious problems around ratification and timelines.”A fishing industry source said that a three-year deal on EU fishing in UK waters – as suggested by Mr Eustice – and the loss of further access would “spell the death knell of the Irish seafood sector”.Mr Coveney said he would not speculate on what was being offered on fishing.Britain’s introduction of the legislation has hardened demands from the EU side for guarantees that would prevent Britain from breaking fair competition agreements after any deal was signed, leading to stand-offs over what authority could arbitrate any future disputes.Any deal reached by negotiators must win the approval of member states and be ratified by both the British parliament and the European Parliament, a process that MEPs have warned there may not now be sufficient time left to do.Both sides see the talks as nearing an imminent end point, with the next days to decide conclusively whether Britain will end its transition period on December 31st with a deal with its largest trading partner, or an abrupt dissolution of terms expected to cause widespread disruption.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The legislature frequently updates Acts and now is the right time to take a fresh look at the Human Rights Act, see how its provisions are operating and consider whether the framework could be improved.Ministers say the review is not in response to specific cases such as last week\u0027s deportation but aims to be an independent investigation into the wider workings of the Act.The review, which will report next summer, will focus on three key areas including the duty in the Act for judges to take into account European case law, which critics claim has led to them gold-plating Britain\u0027s human rights duties.As part of a separate review of asylum, the Home Office wants to narrow the types of cases which can use Article 3 of the Human Rights Act in a bid to stop judges gold-plating the UK\u0027s duties under international law. It could mean the Government would be able to deport hundreds more foreign criminals a year as they would be blocked from bringing spurious human rights claims.The Ministry of Justice review will also investigate whether judges have been unduly drawn into Government policy over human rights and whether they should still have the power to rewrite laws if they are determined to be in conflict with the Human Rights Act.In his article, Mr Buckland said this had not always been limited to minor, uncontroversial technical changes but had, for example, been used to strike down the rape shield which had banned the cross-examination of rape complainants on their past sexual behaviour. The court held that this law was not compliant with the Human Rights Act as it infringed on the right to a fair trial, and used its power to re-write this legislation, adding exceptions to the rape shield law, he said. It is surely worth asking whether, and if so how, such important and controversial decisions over how to change the law should be returned to Parliament.The third area centres on whether there should be changes to the way the Human Rights Act applies outside the UK, such as the contentious issue of whether soldiers should be covered on active duties overseas.A Bill currently before Parliament giving British troops and veterans greater protection against prosecution has been criticised by human rights groups.Mr Buckland said: Let there be no doubt that this Government remains committed to human rights and that our Parliamentary democracy must continue leading the world in this area of the law. We believe that an independent review is best placed to determine whether there are ways in which the Human Rights Act can and should change for the future. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"juan guaido prepares lose seat venezuela freedom","story":"When Juan Guaido raised his right hand and symbolically swore himself in as Venezuela’s interim president nearly two years ago, the tens of thousands watching on a main Caracas avenue rejoiced.As the country’s national anthem, “Glory to the Brave People,” then blasted through loudspeakers, some lifted their hands in a sign of victory, crying and overwhelmed with emotion. The trickle of news alerts in the following days advising that another country had recognised the 35 year-old as the country’s rightful leader seemed to confirm their certainty that Nicolas Maduro would soon be forced from the presidential palace.But two years on and Mr Maduro remains in power with complete control.  And after parliamentary elections on Sunday, that claim will likely collapse entirely when he loses his seat and thus his claim as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate president.He may also lose his freedom.With Guaido’s term ending, so too will his parliamentary immunity. Mr Maduro may feel emboldened to detain the opposition leader or force him to flee the country. In an ominous sign of Mr Guaido\u0027s international support disintegrating, on Tuesday his envoy to the United Kingdom, Vanessa Neumann, announced her resignation from the post, appearing to jump ship before it sinks completely.  “My affection for, and ties to, the UK will always run deep,” Neumann told The Sunday . This is not an election anyone in the Western world would recognise, she added.Mr Guaido has promised that the current parliament’s term will continue, citing a vague legal theory of “constitutional continuity.” The claims are unlike to get him far.For Mr Maduro the election offers an opportunity to declare victory in a power struggle that has dragged on for too long. In the streets, Mr Maduro’s allies have launched an aggressive media and ground offensive that would suggest the vote is a competitive race. State TV broadcasts raucous government rallies held throughout the country.“Let’s go together to vote for Venezuela, all together we will rescue the National Assembly,” pop stars Chucho y Omar Acedo sing in the chorus of a catchy humber seemingly playing on loop on radio and TV and from loudspeakers on trucks driving through the streets.Giving the election some semblance of legitimacy, hundreds of candidates identifying as opposition to Mr Maduro have enrolled in defiance of Guaido’s boycott. The country’s pro-regime electoral board has banned prominent politicians from a handful of traditional opposition parties.Some polls show as little as 14 per cent of Venezuelans plan to vote.“This isn’t a democratic vote and no right in this country is guaranteed,” Lauren Caballero, one of the few opposition candidates standing told the Sunday . “If there are not fair conditions, we will conquer them, but not by standing idly by.” This week Mr Caballero campaigned in working class neighborhoods in his hometown La Guaira state on the country’s coast. A handful of young supporters beating drums drew neighbors to their doors where Caballero offered his pitch.“We don’t have water or electricity, but here they are asking for votes again,” Carmen Mile, an unemployed mother of four, said.The country’s economic crisis has only worsened in the two years since Guaido declared himself president. Three continuous years of hyperinflation have ravaged incomes. Currently a monthly minimum wage buys only a kilo of pasta. Over 5 million have fled the country since the crisis began in 2013. The country’s collapsing infrastructure means many spend months without running water.A recent study published by the country’s main universities found that in vulnerable communities, 100 per cent of residents live with food insecurity. “Whoever doesn’t vote, won’t eat, for whoever doesn’t vote, there won’t be food,” regime number two Diosdado Cabello said through laughter at a rally on Monday in central Venezuela. Tens of thousands have become dependent on the sporadic delivery of government food boxes to survive the crisis. Maduro has promised a “special prize” for the communities with the highest turnout. Mile, the woman visited by the dissident opposition candidate on the coast, said she plans to vote, but wouldn’t specify for whom. She survives on government handouts and money from odd jobs from her children.   “It’s an obligation, I’ll just say that,” she said. Additional reporting by Daniel Blanco Paz and Ivanna Laura in La Guaira, VenezuelaMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new monolith appears isle wight","story":"An extraordinary reflective monolith emerged on the Isle of Wight yesterday at the bottom of a sheer cliff on Compton Beach, baffling locals. Ami Blackburn, 31, went to investigate and take her own photos with her son and boyfriend after seeing pictures on social media but reading rumours they may have been photoshopped.Miss Blackburn, who is a healthcare assistant from Newport, Isle of Wight, said: I saw the comments about the possibility of photoshop so my partner, myself and my youngest went to check it out.I thought I was very bizarre when I first saw it and immediately researched the ones found in Utah, California and Romania.We moved some of the sand from around the bottom and it\u0027s partly buried but we felt underneath and it was made of wood with mirrors stuck to the side.I\u0027d love the idea of it being delivered by aliens but it\u0027s more than likely an unusual art project.

Sure, the University of Canterbury could treat itself to a lecturer whose expertise was “zombies” and the University of Southampton could employ an “expert” on video games. But this would simply constitute a tax on the gullible and stupid. Eventually applications would fall off, and such institutions would close. The elite institutions, meantime, would purr along like the well-oiled machines that they are. I was wrong.What I failed to take into account was that ancient institutions are expert at adapting to whatever era they are in. And ours is an era whose boundaries have been subtly, but significantly, mis-drawn. Like a post-war border-treaty, a single deviation of the pen stores up trouble generations down the line.In our age anything deemed “hostile” by a member of a “vulnerable group” is made impermissible. Not simply in polite society, but in law – even in policing. What is a “non-crime hate-incident” but a bogus concept written into law? It makes no judgment on whether the “hostility” was real or imagined, and it cannot adjudicate whether the claim is made sincerely or in order to win some other (often political) battle. To make such a claim is to win, leaving our society and its institutions permanently at the mercy of (among others) the deluded and malevolent. Of course institutions that survived the Reformation, the civil war and much more should know how to adapt to the guiding faith of the age. They have spent centuries practising.There has been much attention paid to the case of Will Knowland – the Eton teacher sacked after uploading to YouTube a talk to pupils in which he said that differences between men and women aren’t always attributable to environmental factors.What he said was true. It also runs against one of the prevailing lies of the age (that sex differences are not biological but environmental). So just as in a previous age an Eton master might have made himself vulnerable by doubting the eucharistic bread was the actual body of Christ, so Knowland became vulnerable. But it is the badly drawn laws of this country that did for him.The recognition that such lines must be drawn well is why a fight is going on at another of our ancient institutions. At Cambridge University, a free-speech row is ongoing thanks to its vice chancellor Stephen Toope. This Canadian lawyer heads an institution that has developed an apparent habit of punishing academics who step outside the orthodox lies of the age. Witness Cambridge’s treatment of Noah Carl and Jordan Peterson. Now Toope is trying to double-down by pushing through a new free speech policy. Recognising the drawing of a poorly-drawn line when he sees one, a much smarter man than Toope (senior philosophy lecturer Arif Ahmed) is leading a push-back.The Toope policy demands that differences of opinion be “respected”. Ahmed rightly says that, no, another person cannot simply demand or expect “respect” for their opinion. What we should have is “tolerance” for other people’s opinions.Quite so. The demand of our era that everybody and anything be “respected” has become one of the bully-words to shut down discussion of difficult issues and the bully’s way to bulldoze through their own, often erroneous, claims. Once the line is drawn where Toope wants to draw it, good people (including people telling the truth) are left permanently at risk of being stranded behind enemy lines.This may seem theoretical. But it is not. In defending the sacking of Mr Knowland, the headmaster of Eton said that a lawyer employed to give an opinion on the case warned that Knowland’s speech may have broken this country’s equality laws.And here is the thing. Perhaps it did. But that is because the equality laws of this country – like Toope’s “respect” rule at Cambridge – are an ass. Institutions like Eton hide behind their wretched lawyers only because the law can be interpreted as being on their side. It is no good complaining about cowards in high places if those cowards have (or even believe they have) the law on their side. What would be good would be for this country – and specifically this Conservative Government – to change the law: to undo the last Labour government’s deeply inexact tampering in the Equalities Act.Ancient institutions are designed to adapt to survive whatever era they are in. It is no surprise that they have adapted to our new woke state religion. For as long as they have the law on their side, it is not enough to demand the presence of braver or better people at the top of our institutions. It is necessary to change those laws. And the religion.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bridget jones author finally ends rumour sir keir starmer inspired","story":"The “sparring” between Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer at the despatch box has been compared to the infamous rows between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver by the author of Bridget Jones’s Diary, Helen Fielding.But, despite likening Sir Keir to Mr Darcy, Ms Fielding quashed the longstanding rumour that the Labour leader had inspired the character in the hit books and movie franchise.Ms Fielding has long skirted around the gossip, which Sir Keir admitted himself had been “doing the rounds for years”. Everybody asks me this question when they should be asking her (Fielding) because she knows the answer and I don\u0027t,” he told ITV in January. It\u0027s a rumour that\u0027s been doing the rounds for years, but I honestly don\u0027t know the answer...Of course I would (be flattered). But I honestly don\u0027t know.At the time the books were written the Labour leader was making a name for himself as a leading barrister, just like Mr Darcy.Sir Keir had assisted Helen Steel and David Morris in the famous McLibel case, as well as representing the National Union of Miners and acting a legal observer at the Wapping strikes in the \u002780s.It was also suspected the pair may have crossed paths early in life.They both attended Oxford University (though in different years) and had been living in Leeds around the same time.Ms Fielding is understood to have been living in Morely, West Yorkshire, while Sir Keir studied for his undergraduate degree at the University of Leeds in 1985.In July Ms Fielding said a “number of people” lay claim to be the inspiration behind Mr Darcy’s character.It’s amazing the number of people that lay claim to be Daniel or Mark, including Keir Starmer, she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Desert Island Discs. Though did not concretely discredit the suspected link.And, despite “always denying” Bridget was based on her own life, she added, “of course she was very close to me in some ways but not in others.I was a single girl in London and having lots of fun.But she has now finally put the rumour mill to bed, telling Radio Times Christmas Issue that although she thinks he’s “fantastic”, Sir Keir is not the basis of the character and the pair have never met.“They are very similar, though,” she told Radio Times.“He’s so good and decent and intelligent, but so buttoned up. I always want to say, ‘Come on, Keir, loosen your tie, ruffle up your hair.’ “He doesn’t think of himself as sexy, but he’s really sexy.”Ms Fielding went on to add: “And when he and Boris spar, it does remind me of Mark and Daniel.”Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth in the film adaptations, and Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, frequently clashed over their respective love for Bridget, played by Renee Zellwegger. Though Mr Johnson and Sir Keir may have come to blows verbally in the Commons frequently, they are yet to be pictured scrapping in any water fountains.It’s now 25 years since Ms Fielding first published her newspaper column as Bridget Jones, which went on to be novelised in 1996 and a sequel published in 1999. The books were adapted for film in 2001 and 2004, with a third novel released in 2013 and a fourth in 2016. The 2016 film Bridget Jones’s Baby became the UK’s highest-grossing romantic comedy of the year.To mark the 25th anniversary a BBC Two documentary, Being Bridget, will be aired on December 22. “If somebody had told me at the time that people would still be talking about it in 25 years, I would never have believed them,” she told Radio Times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monday morning news briefing eu backs fishing brexit trade deal","story":"The EU backed down over post-Brexit fishing arrangements last night – but the chances of a trade deal remain on a knife edge, with other key issues unresolved.

This and the other vaccines are a huge step forward in the fight against coronavirus and could save tens of thousands of lives. So is the vaccine safe  Who’ll get it first  And will it mean ato normal le  Our  of medical experts - made up of Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Chief Executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Dr June Raine CBE and Head of Immunisations at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay - are here to answer all your questions...  Q. Vaccines usually take years to develop, so how can the Covid- vaccination be safeit’s ready in months  Professor Van-Tam: These vaccines have been through phase one, phase two and phase three, just like ordinary vaccines. With the Pfizer vaccine, I think the total clinical trial size is something like , the AstraZeneca results so far reported are based on just over , volunteers – there’s at least another , to follow, and the number size for Moderna is very similar. These are very, very big studies. The numbers involved were essentially the same as you’d expect for a normal peacetime vaccine, and on top of that the safety assessments and the assessments of effectiveness at the end are the same. Dr Raine: The public can be completely confident that Covid- vaccines will only be available once they have met robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. As Covid- is a public health emergency, scientic evaluation and approval is being done in the shortest time possible while complying with established and robust safety, quality and effectiveness standards. Extensive knowledge on vaccine development with existing vaccines is applied. Safety is our watchword. Everyone can be absolutely clear that the standards that need to be met, will be met. I am completely confident that there has been no pressure whatsoever on the agency and our expert staff to pass the vaccine. None at all. Q. How have you decided who gets the vaccine first  Dr Ramsay: We looked at a lot of data showing who was getting infection and who was dying from infection. The primary thing the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationlooked at was death rates by age, by clinical factors, and by any other factors that GPs could measure, such as deprivation, geography or ethnicity. It’s very clear the death rate is much higher as you get older, particularly over . That’s why we’re prioritising people in older age groups, then coming down in age, picking up people who are clinically vulnerable and those who have underlying conditions along the way. Those working in health and social care will be high on the list as well – they are at risk because they’re getting exposed to infection every day and they may be spreading it to others. The same goes for care home workers – they’re a very high priority.  Q. Will the vaccine prevent disease or just reduce symptoms   Professor Van-Tam: If you’re going to prevent transmission you need a vaccine that is taking out the illness and also the asymptomatic infections. There are some signs from AstraZeneca that this might be the case. That does not mean the other vaccines where results have already been announced or that are or are still in development, don’t also reduce transmission it’s just we don’t know at this point in time. We hope they will because they’ll have a bigger effectthey can take out transmission. Q. Are there any side effects  Dr Ramsay: All the side effects are predictable – the kind of thing you get with other vaccines: a sore arm, bit of a temperature or feeling a bit fatigued, so we’re expecting it to have a similar safety profile to other vaccines. Professor Van-Tam: Every single vaccine authorised for use in the UK has been authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . The three components of authorisation are a safety assessment, an effectiveness assessment and a manufacturing quality assessment – all three need to be ticked before anything is authorised. But there is not a single medicine without side effects. Is it possible that rare side effects could come to light that you’d never pick up in a clinical trial of ,-, patients  Yes, it is – but that’s no dferent from any other medicine.  Q. How will the vaccine be rolled out  Dr Ramsay: The actual act of giving the injection isn’t particularly skillful – all nurses are trained and most vaccines are given by nurses, but with the flu jab we use health care assistants. The key thing is they work under the supervision of nurses. I think there’s going to be a lot of dferent models used because, for example, with elderly, frail people they’re clearly not going to drive to the nearest centre – you might have to take vaccine to them in their home. The hospitals will probably be doing their staff, then there will potentially be these vaccination sites which will probably be more important for the slightly younger population who can drive there. Q. Is there anyone who shouldn’t have it   Dr Ramsay: A reason to defer a vaccination is being pregnant – that’s just being precautionary. We don’t expect there to be a problem, but without having the vaccine tested on pregnant women we’ll probably recommend they wait until after they’ve had the baby. Similarly, it hasn’t been tested in children, although a teenager would probably respond similarly to a young adult so they could likely have the vaccine. Q. Will it be available privately  Professor Van-Tam: I don’t know, but I think it would be a bad thing for public healththe rich and privileged were able to pay their way to the front of the queue, leaving someone at very high risk and not wealthy low down the list – and they would be there’s going to be a global shortage of these vaccines. So I’m opposed to that. Q.

That could mean we crash out of EU rules without a trade pact - with tarfs and paperwork being slapped on much of the UK’s £bn a year in trade with the EU from January . Food could become more expensive in the supermarket and deliveries could be held up by bureaucracy at the border.  The Budget watchdog says it could cut GDP by % in  and delay our Covid recovery by almost a year. It’s a far cry from when Boris Johnson said in : “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.” And it’s hardly the “oven-ready” deal the Prime Minister promised the British people he had in last year’s election. So what are the three sticking points  Why hasn’t the so-called “oven-ready deal” been as tasty as we hoped  And when might the deadlock end  Here’s what you need to know.What is the deal we’re trying to agree  The UK is trying to agree a Free Trade Agreement with the EU for when the Brexit transition period ends on December . This would allow us to enjoy cheaper, easier trade with our nearest neighbours thanwe crashed out of the EU with no pact. While no deal will be as seamless as EU membership, Brexiteers say an FTA is a way of having our cake and eating it. We could make our own laws while also paying smaller tarfs and having less bureaucracy than a nation with no trade deal.  If we don’t get a deal, EU trading rules will end on New Year’s Eve and slap billions in tarfs overnight on essential goods. Britain is also negotiating trade deals with dozens of other countries like Japan but the EU is far, far more important. In  the EU accounted for almost half of UK trade - £bn. The second-placed US counted for £bn. Japan, £bn. And our economy has been used to tarf-free EU trade for decades, meaning any change on January  could be a big shock. How is this dferent from Boris Johnson’s ‘oven-ready deal’   You may remember Boris Johnson won the election by promising to ‘get Brexit done’. He said: “We’ve got a deal that’s oven-ready. We’ve just got to put it in at gas mark four, give it  minutes and Bob’s your uncle.” But his “oven-ready” deal was only the Withdrawal Agreement to leave the EU.That agreement didn’t actually guarantee how anytradewould work after .Call it clever wording, call it lies - however you look at it, the ‘oven-ready’ deal doesn’t help us much now. It’s like he put an empty pie casing in the oven to blind-bake, but hadn’t mixed any of the filling together yet. Why don’t we have an agreement yet   The EU and UK have been negotiating an agreement since Spring, but since about the summer talks have been deadlocked. They are stuck on three issues - fishing rights, the ‘level playing field’ and how any deal will be policed . Talks missed deadlines of mid-October and mid-November, before coming to what the UK claimed was almost a breakthrough. But the EU then “added a whole load of additional demands”, according to Environment Secretary George Eustice. UK officials believe French President Emmanuel Macron was behind the new harder position. Adding to this, there’s a row over Boris Johnson planning to break international law. The UK Internal Market Bill - due in the Commons on Monday - will give the UK ultimate power over the rules for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This would breach the Withdrawal Agreementwhich the UK and EU signed last year. Back then, Boris Johnson promised to arbitrate those rules via a joint committee. When will the logjam end   Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are due to speak on Monday evening. Talks might continue beyond that point - andthey do, UK officials believe it will be a good sign. Thataposs becauseprogress is made thereaposll be no point giving up on it on Monday night. Butthere isnapost any progress by Monday night it could be curtains at that point, a UK source warned. Any deal ideally wants to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit this week before being signed off by the European Parliament before New Year. The three sticking points explainedFishing The UK and EU each want as much fish as possible from UK waters after December . But it’s not as simple as just barring all EU fishermen. There needs to be a negotiation - otherwise UK fleets would struggle to access EU waters, or sell their fish into EU markets. The first key point is quotas - whether UK boats will be allowed to catch more fish in their own waters than they do now. In -, % of the fish in UK waters was caught by EU boats and % by UK boats. Reports suggested the EU was prepared to% of its current quotas to UK fishermen, but Britain said this wasn’t enough. Before talks stalled last week, a deal taking back as much as % of EU quotas to the UK seemed possible, it is claimed. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: “The EU have suggested a very modest increase that they would tolerate the UK having of the fish in its own waters. But given we only have half the fish in our own waters now, that simply wouldn’t be possible.” Quotas cover many issues but not all of them - because fish move around the seas. The other key point is over access - both to the territorial waters within  miles of UK soil, and a -mile economic exclusion zone around its coastline. UK sources say the EU essentially wants the same access as it enjoys now under the Common Fisheries Policy. That is unacceptable to UK officials, who say they want to control access to UK waters - even , in reality, EU fleets will be let in anyway. Mr Eustice said the EU was trying to get access to UK waters “in perpetuity” rather than agreeing three years at a time. “Such a suggestion really is quite ludicrous and not consistent with international law,” he said. Itaposs thought the UK is looking at a three-year transition period to new access arrangements.The level playing field"},{"url":null,"title":"first pictures coronavirus jab doses","story":"NewsFirst pictures of coronavirus jab doses in UK hospitals ready in less than hrsThe UK is set to lead the world in rolling out a mass vaccination programme as Pfizer and BioNTechs Covid- jab arrives in hospitals with doses ready for the publicmirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video covid-vaccine-arrives-hospitals-across-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Hundreds of thousands of doses arrived in the UK on Friday on refrigerated trucks from Belgium. From there they were taken to specialist refrigerated storage facilities, at undisclosed locations, before finally being shipped to the  hospitals taking part in stage one of the rollout. And the first pictures of vaccine arriving in an NHS hospital, released today, show a pharmacy technician from Croydon Health Services taking delivery at Croydon University Hospital of the first batch to be delivered to the area. The UK has secured  million doses of the vaccine, enough to treat  million people in the coming months. The doses will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs from Tuesday – with people aged  and over, care home workers and NHS workers who are at higher risk the first to receive the jab. There are  hubs in the first wave of the vaccination programme in England, with more hospitals starting to vaccinate over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up. The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used for the national immunisation programmes.  It comes as Matt Hancock claimed that a second vaccine, made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca may be approved for use in the UK as soon as Christmas. The Health Secretary suggested that the UK made jab could quickly follow the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, and become the second to get the green light from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . He said “It may come before Christmas, it may come early in the new year. On Sunday the UKaposs chief medicine regulator said there was no doubt that the Covid vaccine approved in the UK is safe.  Mr Hancock also claimed a successful rollout would mean lockdown restrictions could end before March. The Health Secretaryaposs optimistic prediction comes as hospitals are preparing to begin the first phase of the largest-scale vaccination campaign in the UKaposs history. GP surgeries in England have been told to start staffing COVID- vaccination centres by  December. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , which approved the Pfizer BioNTech jab, said there “should be no doubt whatever that this is a very safe and highly effective vaccine”.  Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show about how important the public health message is to make sure that people actually take the vaccine, she said: “It’s vitally important. And I would really like to emphasise that the highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards. And so there should be real confidence in the rigour of our approval. The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers said the UK is expecting to receive up to four million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine by the end of December. But Saffron Cordery explained the dficulty of getting the virus into care homes and smaller community-based vaccination centres. She told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday that only hospitals had the infrastructure to store the vaccines because of the incredibly low temperature it is required to be stored at.  She said hospitals receiving the first batch of vaccines were calling people aged  and over in their areas to come into hospitals and setting up separate clinics on-site. Right now they can only be administered in hospitals but trusts up and down the country are working with the MHRA , who is overseeing this process, to seethey can get them distributed more closely to care homes so that they can go into care homes and sort the vaccines for those residents, she said. Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Despite the huge complexities, hospitals will kickstart the first phase of the largest scale vaccination campaign in our countryaposs history from Tuesday.  Ben Osborn, the UK chief executive of Pfizer, told The Mail on Sunday that he is so confident about the safety of the jab that he is willing to take it today and wants his mother to have it as soon as possible.Mr Hancock has reportedly been referring to Tuesday as V-Day and told The Sundaythat he canapost wait to scrap the three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions before March and get back to living by mutual respect and personal responsibility, not laws set in parliament.When askedthe distribution of the vaccine beginning this week could mean restrictions end sooner, he said: Yes, it will. He added: Thereaposs no doubt that having the vaccine early... will bring forward the moment when we can get rid of these blasted restrictions but until then we have got to follow them. It came as plans emerged to see millions of doses of the Covid- vaccine manufactured in Belgium flown into this country by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit, under contingency plans being developed by the government.Both the Department of Health and Social Care, and senior sources at the Ministry of Defence , confirmed that large consignments would be brought to the UK from  January by airroad, rail and sea routes were subject to widely expected delays after that date. On the threat of no-deal Brexit Dr Raine said we are ready”. “We’ve practised, we are ready, we are fully prepared for any possible outcome,” she told Andrew Marr. Elsewhere, the Queen and Prince Philip are both expected to have the coronavirus vaccine within weeks but palace sources insisted they “will not jump the queue” and instead have it at the appropriate time. The monarch,  and Duke of Edinburgh, , will both be eligible in the second round of vaccinations aftercare home residents.  Palace sources suggested the royal would be reluctant to go public with their decision to be vaccinated, despite figures in government feeling it would send a strong message to the public. Meanwhile, there is still no guaranteed date for when care home residents will be vaccinated despite them being at the top of the priority list, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying there are “signicant challenges” to overcome.  Logistical issues mean there are dficulties in getting the jab to residents, as the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. The vaccine boxes containing  doses will need to be split so that they can be brought to care homes. Dr Raine told Marr: “We have approved how the vaccine can be put into the small packs, but obviously what we’re doing is giving advice and guidance on how well that, carefully, that is done.

Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “This year communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money. “Volunteers in foodbanks have been working tirelessly under extremely dficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials.  “Our volunteers are now bracing themselves for an extremely busy Christmas period - but it’s not right that any of us are forced to a charity for food, at any time of year.” Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “It would sink any parent’s heart to have to go to a foodbank to feed their kids. “But as these figures show, for so many families now it’s aposeat from the foodbank or don’t eat at allapos that isn’t right.  “The pandemic has exposed just how many families are on precarious incomes, and it’s revealed that the safety net we have just isn’t adequate when times are tough.”She called for the Government to extend a temporary £-a-week rise in Universal Credit, which was a announced in March and is due to end in April.“That would be a big help to the millions of families struggling to stay afloat,” she added. Labour and the Liberal Democrats echoed the call.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “Too many families are facing real stress about how they will get by this December.  “Our social security system is not fit for purpose when so many people need to turn to foodbanks to afford essentials this Christmas. “The Government must do more to support people and scrap its planned cut to Universal Credit, which will take £ a week from six million families.” Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Too many people had to rely on foodbanks even before the pandemic, but the jump in demand since April makes horribly clear the scale of the hardship caused by coronavirus.

UK ministers are expecting to be able to announce a halfway-house deal on pet travel to the continent from January. Under the proposed scheme, Brits would need to visit the vet around a month before taking a dog, cat or ferret to the EU. That would be a big drop from a four-month process which was expected to take force from January .However, it’s still much more of a burden than the current pet passport scheme, which is ending in Britain due to Brexit.The compromise was hinted at today by Environment Secretary George Eustice. He told the BBC: “We’re likely to be listed in the EU’s Annex II, the second category. “[That] means whereas in the past you might have had a pet passport, in future you’d need a certicate from the vet instead of a passport. “It won’t be as easy as having the passport because you’d need to go to the vet prior to leaving, rather than have the passport that shows your rabies vaccines are up to date.” A Whitehall source said they were expecting a formal announcement in the coming days.  Until now, the UK government has been working on the basis that Britain will be an “unlisted” nation for pet travel. That would mean any pet owner taking a dog, cat or ferret to the EU from January  must go through a four-month process, including waiting three months after a blood sample. Mr Eustice, however, said it is “likely” the EU will agree for the UK to become a “listed” nation. It is understood he was referring to a process called ‘Part ’ listing, which applies to most listed nations outside the EU. Under this category, the rules for British pet owners would be less stringent than for an unlisted country.

But evenwe do get a deal, things are going to look very dferent for Brits who go abroad from  January . When Brexit happened on January , we entered an -month transition period where EU rules continued as they are now. That means you’ve been able to go on holiday with pets, passports and free roaming and healthcare, asnothing had changed, and businesses can trade freely with the EU.At the stroke of pm on December , many of these protections will fall away. Some of the effects may be less severethe UK and EU agree a trade deal, but others will come into force regardless. So how will Brexit affect your day-to-day le and holidays after January  and what should you do to prepare  Here’s a basic guide. If we donapost get a trade deal with the EU If we get a trade deal with the EU, it will make importing and exporting goods easier and cheaper than it would otherwise be, with less paperwork and fewer tarfs. Itaposll be more similar to how things are now . Butwe donapost, there will be billions of pounds a year in extra costs for businesses. That is because we will default to more expensive World Trade Organisation trading terms. That could mean disruption at ports and passing on costs to consumers, with everyday goods getting more expensive in the supermarket. This will be more noticeable with the EU than other countries we donapost have a trade deal with, because the EU makes up almost half our trade. Food prices could go up  Tory George Eustice admitted that the UK crashing out could push food prices up. Askedfood prices would risethere’s no trade deal, the Environment Secretary told LBC Radio: “Yes we’ve looked at that. The impact of tarfs on consumer food prices is actually quite modest. Probably less than %.” In the event of no-deal tarfs averaging  per cent will be imposed on food and drink imported from the continent, with retailers likely to pass somenot all of this additional cost onto consumers. The UK imports around  per cent of its food, with  per cent coming from the EU, leaving UK’s supermarket shelves particularly exposed to any disruption on our relationship with the continent. Disruptions at the border could also cause delays in importing food into the country - potentially leading to shortages of certain imported favourites. Medicine could be disrupted  Experts have warned that failing to strike a post-Brexit trade agreement could disrupt the flow of some medicine into the UK. In September, trade bodies the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industryand European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associationsurged both sides to prioritise medicines in trade talks “to protect the supply of medicines for  million patients and safeguard the signicant opportunities that working together on medicines research and development brings to both economies”. The Government has also been working on contingency plans including creating buffer stocks of certain medical suppliers where possible and tendering for a £m freight contract to act as a back up to ensure that Category  goods, which would include vaccines, will be able to be imported to the UK. But with complex supply chains that stretch across the continent pharmacists and doctors are concerned about the consequences of no deal. Officials have been keen to stress that it will not disrupt the vaccine arriving in the UK - with officials having wargamed disruption and ministers ready to order to military flights to make sure that doses of the vaccine can arrive without interruptions. Cars become more expensive The UKaposs car industry risks losing £bn in manufacturing value within five years in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to an industry analysis. British car production could drop below m cars a yearthere is no deal, compared with more than .m in , because tarfs would make large parts of the UK business unviable, said forecasts commissioned by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry lobby group. No deal would result in % tarfs being applied overnight, adding £, to the average cost of a car imported from the EU. And a no-deal Brexit would jeopardise the future of UK plants. PSA Group has said it will only build its new Vauxhall Astra in the UKthere is a trade deal, while Nissan has said the business model of its Sunderland plant – the largest car factory in the UK – would be destroyed. Chaos at the borders  A No-Deal would likely create chaos at Britain’s borders with delays in getting goods into and out of Europe. Areas around Britain’s largest ports have spent months preparing but local authorities are still fearful of huge backlogs choking motorways in Kent. Companies exporting goods with also face tarfs on WTO terms and the added uncertainty of how to transport their goods to the EU. The licences that hauliers need for work in Europe would no longer be valid and they would be reliant on a limited number of permits from the European Conference of Ministers of Transport Even in the event of a deal government has quietly confirmed a list of  lorry parks to deal with the fallout from Brexit. The ‘inland sites’ will be built in Kent, Essex, Birmingham, Warrington and North Wales - with seven of them due to being ready by January. Violence in Northern Ireland  Spooks have warned that the UK failing to secure a deal could lead to increased violence in Northern Ireland. A report by Parliament’s intelligence and security committeewarned that changes on the island of Ireland could reignite dissident republican violence. MI devoted % of its resources to countering terrorism in Northern Ireland in the year to March . The failure would also create more immediate problems Without a trade deal, the ide between Britain and Northern Ireland would become more distinct. Brexit without a trade deal could allow Northern Ireland to become a back door into the EU’s single market, thus raising the spectre of a hard border on the island of Ireland for the first time since a  peace deal. The  Good Friday Agreement brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence between mainly Protestant Unionists who favour continued British rule and mainly Catholic Irish Nationalists who want a united Ireland. A big hit to the economy - and delayed Covid recovery The Office for Budget Responsibility said the failure to reach a free trade agreement with the EU will “compound” the massive impact of Covid and delay economic recovery by a year.  caused the biggest fall in economic output in  years with % of GDP being wiped out. But a failure to reach an agreement and defaulting to World Trade Organisation trms, including tarfs on trade with the EU, would cause even more damaging to the UKaposs faltering economy. This would “have the effect of delaying the point at which output regains its pre-virus peak by almost a year to the third quarter of ”. If you run a businessIn practical terms,you donapost run a business you might not see a direct impact on your family straight away. For business owners,we donapost a deal, the UK Global Tarf will apply to goods you import from the EU from  January .It applies to imports from all countries, unless you are importing from a country that the UK has a trade deal with, a country that is part of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences or where an exception applies.Use the tarf lookup tool to check the tarfs that may apply to goods you import from  January .Most traders with a good compliance record will be able to defer declarations on most goods for up to six months after  January .You can get more information here.Whether we get an EU trade deal or notWhatI run a business Whether thereaposs a trade deal or not, business owners will sill need to make customs declarations when they import goods from the EU. Thataposs because weaposre leaving the EU customs union and single market, evenwe get a trade deal. Most businesses get someone to deal with customs for them.Customs agents, freight forwarders and express operators can help you with declarations and ensure you are providing the necessary information. Click here to find out more.Businesses will need to check what new licences and certicates they may now need. Firms also need to check the rules for importing alcohol, tobacco and certain oils. You need an EORI number to import goods from  January . You will need this to complete customs declarations.The number is needed to use HMRC’s customs systems, soyou don’t get one before the end of the transition period your goods may be delayed, and you risk having to pay storage fees for your goods. Click here to get one. Should I renew my passport  You do not automatically need a new passport because of Brexit. Your old one remains valid evenit says ‘European Union’ on the cover. However, you must renew your passportit has less than six months before expiry on the day you travel. At the moment, British citizens can enter aposSchengen areaapos countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left. This changes from  January . After this date, your passport must have at least six months left. Your passport must also be no more than  years old, evenit has six months left before expiry. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Do I need a visa Tourists will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries, of up to  days. This exemption also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. However, you will most like need a visayou are going to the EU to live, work or study.WhatI have a pet  EU ‘pet passports’ for dogs, cats and ferrets will no longer be valid from  January , prompting a huge surge in red tape. Current requirements say your pet should be vaccinated and microchipped three weeks before the first visit. But for any holidays after December , you must visit a vet at least four months before you travel. First you must get the animal vaccinated against rabies. Then you must wait at least  days before having a blood sample taken. Another three months after that , you can travel. The vet must give you a copy of the test results and an animal health certicate . But you need to time this move carefully, because once your vet produces the certicate, it’s only valid for  days to take your pet into the EU. This process may become easierthe UK joins the EU’s register of “listed” countries, but that’s not guaranteed yet.Do I need to change my travel insurance Quite possibly. Currently UK travellers to the EU don’t need private health insurance, because they’re covered by European Health Insurance Cards . But EHICs will no longer guarantee you free cover in EU nations from January . The government has still not published full details of health arrangements between dferent countries in the EU. But tourists are being urged to buy “comprehensive” travel insurance that covers “all needs” to fill any gaps.Will there be data roaming charges  Quite possibly. Mobile phone users currently get free data roaming across the whole of the EU. But after January , Brits will no longer get this privilege and phone firms will be free to hit you with roaming charges. You must check with your phone provider to seeyou will be affected. If you are hit with roaming charges, you can rack up a bill of £ before you are prompted and askedyou want to spend more.What will the duty-free rules be Duty-free shopping willafter January  for Brits who are going to the continent. This means people can buy duty-free goods in British ports, airports and international rail stations before leaving for the EU. It also means people can bring in goods they’ve bought duty-free in EU airports back to the UK. However, there will be a limit on how much booze or tobacco Brits can bring home from the EU. A ‘booze cruise’ will be able to bring  litres of beer, and  litres of still wine, and  litres of spirits or  litres of sparkling or fortied wine. You can also bring back either  cigarettes, or  cigarillos, or  cigars, or g tobacco - or a combination of the above.Can I drive my car in the EU Yes, but there will be more red tape. Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But from January  many countries will require you to get an International Driving Permit, which costs £. at the Post Office. The number issued each year is expected to soar from , to million. It’s not yet clear which type of IDP you’ll need for which countries. The government is yet to confirm. Meanwhile, you will also be forced to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies, though firms may increase admin fees to deal with red tape. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting.Can I watch Netflix and Amazon Prime on holiday  Subscription services like Netflix and Amazon Prime will no longer be forced by law to let you watch your account in full in the EU.While the exact policy is up to inidual companies, in theory you could lose access to some contentyou’re watching overseas. It is because the UK will no longer be bound by the EU’s “portability regulation” from January .WhatI’ve booked a package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thataposs based anywhere in the EU. But after January , that protection will only applythe firms are established in the UK or ”actively targeting the UK market. If you’re unsure, check the firm’s terms and conditions before you book to make sure you’ll be protected. Will I face queues at the border or ports It is possible, especially at the Channel ports like Dover. Businesses will face new red tape from January  , especiallythere is no trade deal between the UK and EU. In preparation, the government is ready to have thousands of lorries queuing down Kent motorways and a network of Brexit lorry parks. All this could cause disruption at the border, and it may not just be limited to freight ports. A confidential document seen by thealso predicted thousands of passengers could have to wait an additional two hours for Eurostar trains.Can I still use my credit or debit card abroad Check with your issuer, but essentially, yes. However, you may be charged more for using credit or debit cards to pay for things in euros when you buy from companies in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. Payments may also take longer.WhatI’m an EU national in the UK EU nationals living in the UK must register for “settled status”they want to stay after January , and millions have already done so. The deadline to apply is  June . To get settled status, you must have been living in the UK for at least five years continuously, without a break of more than six months. If you have not been in the UK for this long, you can get ‘pre-settled status’. You will then have to make a second application when you reach the five-year mark to upgrade it to settled status. There is no fee to apply for the scheme after the government agreed to demands to scrap it.WhatI’m an UK national in the EU You may need to apply for residency status in the country you’re living in before June . You may also need to buy health insurance or register for healthcare for the country you are living in. And you may need to exchange your drivers’ licence for a local one - among other things.

There’ll be no cards, no presents, no crackers or trimmings – not even a glass of fizz. In fact, on Christmas Day, itself, I’ll be waking up next to a stranger. As crazy as it may sound, I can’t wait.I had no idea what meditation was until I went to Thailand in . I’d separated from my husband after four years of marriage and went away to do some soul-searching.One day I went on a trip with a group of people to a beautul temple and we were askedwe would like to do meditation. I was the only volunteer.  The monk got me to sit in the lotus position, which was terribly painful, then asked me to close my eyes and to see a flame in front of me and focus on my breath.All I could think about was how sore my knees were and what I’d be having for dinner. I couldn’t wait for it to end. It went on for two hours, but when I walked out afterwards, I felt amazing. My senses were heightened, I felt so aware and alert and relaxed. It was incredible. I was training in psychology and interested in how the mind worked so, back in London, I found a meditation class and started going once a week. I bought meditation CDs and books and even a cushion so I could practise at home. I got so into it, my mother became concerned. She thought I was conversing with spirits, trying to become a medium or something.My parents are strong churchgoers and had no idea about meditation. They thought it could be dangerous and affect my mind. But the more I practised, the more I could feel myself benefiting. It helped me understand myself and my relationships better, it helped me come to terms with my orce.I can be quite self-critical and it helped me to be less harsh on myself and learn to manage those critical thoughts better. I felt calmer. I wanted to immerse myself in it more fully so, that year, I went on a Christmas retreat.I’d spent the previous Christmas partying with friends, so spending it in silence couldn’t be more dferent. I didn’t tell my parents or my friends or work colleagues. I thought they’d think I’d become some kind of crazy hippy and it was all a bit weird. I was almost ashamed of it. The retreat was at a Quaker school in Oxfordshire and fairly basic. I was told to bring comfy clothes and slippers. The dormitories were in outbuildings and quite cold. I was relieved to get a room to myself.  But the biggest challenge was the silence. It was a beginner’s retreat for  days so they introduced it gradually – a couple of hours a day, then half a day, then a full day. I still found it dficult. The fact it was Christmas made it harder.I was glad I’d taken a book and spent most of the time reading, then I found out you’re not supposed to read, you’re supposed to avoid all communication, including reading, eye contact and smiling. It’s all about “stilling the mind”. I was tempted to send a text, but I tried to respect the silence because you don’t have that in ordinary le – it’s rare. Everyone was allocated a task – chopping vegetables or washing up, sometimes cleaning the toilet. In between meditation , we got on with our tasks. Of course there is no speaking, so the tasks were listed for us to see on a notice board.Christmas Day was just like any other day. There were no decorations, carols or trimmings. We had a nut roast for dinner and sat in silence.I found it strange at first. It felt rude to be sitting down with no one talking – eating is such a social thing.But after a couple of days, my mind began to slow down and settle and I actually found it quite nice. It took the pressure off making conversation and I could enjoy the food more.It was the same routine every day – we got woken by the bell at am, we did meditation before breakfast, then got on with our tasks. Then, after sitting or walking meditation in the grounds, it was time for lunch. The food was vegetarian or vegan – simple, but good. Always freshly prepared and it smelled lovely. There was no alcohol. I enjoy a glass of wine, but I didn’t miss it.Katy Perry, Jenner Aniston, Madonna and Angelina Jolie have all spoken about the benefits of meditation. Silent retreats were among the top wellness trends for  and often attract people aged  to . Retreats offer the chance to rest, reflect and reconnect with nature, do yoga, swim, walk or simply nap.

Other favourites include Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Trevor McDonald, and Dame Judi Dench. A plummy tone was named as the accent people could listen to for the longest, with the Queen’s English also the preferred voice to hear on the radio or TV. But the Irish accent was named the most attractive, while the Birmingham twang won the title for aposmost boringapos. The research was commissioned to launch Virgin Media’s new Virgin TV  , which is fully voice-activated. It also found that more than a third admitted to speaking in ‘tech tongue’ - putting on a more ‘well-spoken’ accent when speaking to smart devices.  Almost one in five also said they would change their accent to impress a love interest, and one in  do this when speaking to work colleagues or their bosses. And  per cent of Brits even change their normal voice tone when chatting to their pets. Jenner Smith, professor of sociolinguistics at the University of Glasgow, said: “We all have dferent ‘voices’ depending on who we’re talking to and in what situation. We’re quite good at switching up the way we talk. For some of us, this involves putting on a posher-sounding accent when speaking to someone not from our immediate network. For example a student changing how they speak when talking to a teacher. The newly coined term, ‘tech tongue’, describes the voice we use when speaking to your devices, such as your Virgin TV remote. Whether we’re aware we’re doing it or not, tech tongue tends to make us talk slower, or more clearly, and even quite posh. The study also found Brits make judgements based on each other’s voices too, forming an impression of a person’s character, how knowledgeable and how trustworthy they are - just from their voice.

Jo Scollen, , and her husband Jason, , suffered a baby loss nearly every year since they started trying for a child in , and at one point doctors even told them they might as well give up. Jo had no trouble conceiving, but the pregnancy never lasted longer than  weeks and initially doctors couldnapost work out why. They tried IVF, but it didnapost work, and with funds running out Jo had all but given up hope when she entered a competition for a free round of fertility treatment in Cyprus out of desperation. Against all the odds they won and the procedure worked, and the couple, from Wimbledon, south-west London, welcomed baby Jessica Rose into the family last year. Jo said: It was unbelievable. I was at the stage where I was on my knees and about to give up. “After having that many disappointments, you’re dicing with emotional death the whole way through the process. “We had literally run out of funds at that point- both financially and emotionally- and it came entirely out of the blue. “It was a miraculous bolt of positivity. Jessica has been a dream. You’ve never known a more determined baby, and you can tell where she gets it from.  “I don’t think there has ever been a baby that’s more wanted than her. “With Covid everything has been locked down so we’ve not been able to do many of those things I’ve waited  years to do, like seeing family or just going shopping, which is heartbreaking. “But she is here, full of le, and I am so grateful. Jo and Jason, both home renovators, met in a pub in Wimbledon in . They started dating and quickly moved in together, then began trying for a baby after just a year. “Neither of us had a typical lestyle growing up and it was our common bond that we wanted to have a family- and lots of animals. she said. Jo became pregnant for the first time in , and suffered her first loss the same year, when she was around seven weeks along. She said: That was horrendous - all our hopes for the future were there and then our world fell apart. I had to stay in hospital for a week after that. “But it is in both of our natures to not give up easily, we are survivors in our makeup, so we just tried to dust ourselves off and try again.  She said she was unable to get any answers from UK doctors about why she kept having miscarriages. Because she had no problem falling pregnant, she did not consider IVF at the time. In need of a break and a change, they sold everything and moved to Granada, Spain in . She said: It wasn’t working over the years and it was getting harder to deal with in the midst of London. There was so much around that we couldn’t get our heads together.  We came here to reduce stress and simply our le, thinking maybe that would help. She said she was able to get more tests in Spain to look into why she was having miscarriages. Medics discovered she had three types of blood clotting disorders and additional immune factors like chronic fatigue syndromethat could be affecting her pregnancies. Jo said they told her it would be so hard to remain pregnant she might as well give up, she said. She suffered  miscarriages in total before she turned to reproductive assistance in Spain in  which cost about £,. This, alongside all the costs involved in seeing specialists and undergoing tests, was racking up quite a bill for the couple.  A specialist miscarriage doctor from Epsom, Surrey, advised Jo that a precise timing of the medications involved in the procedure could give her a glimmer of hope. She said: We decided it was something that we hadnapost tried before and we should give it a go. Again she fell pregnant as a result, but had her th miscarriage in . “I was on the verge of giving up - each pregnancy and miscarriage was dferent and traumatic in a dferent way, she said. “A lot of clinics said IVF wouldn’t work because I wasn’t having any trouble getting pregnant, which is what the treatment is intended to help with, I just couldn’t hold on to the baby. “There were some clinics that dealt specically with recurrent miscarriages, but we still weren’t successful there.”  Sheaposd almost given up hope when she came across a competition by magazine ivfbabble on Facebook, with a prize of a free cycle of IVF, in November .The competition was to commemorate  years since the birth of the first IVF baby, Louisa Brown. “I just clicked in a desperate moment and then completely forgot about it, said Jo. “We proceeded to have our th loss and I thought there was no point carrying on, but then I got the email through saying I’d won. “I had to ring them up and check that it wasn’t an international scam. “When my husband and I realised it was true, he said ‘I’ve only ever won a bag of crisps’.” Jo and Jason were one of ten winners and believe their baby could have been the first one born from the prize procedure.  Their procedure was scheduled in the Dunya clinic in Cyprus, and the couple travelled for  hours from their home in Spain in November . “Whilst the IVF cycle was free, we had to fund our travel there which wasn’t easy as we live in the middle of nowhere and we ended up having to go via Istanbul, she said. “There were many flight delays, and we had to arrange for care for our many animals, but with IVF everything has a very strict timeline so we had to leave right away. “The benefit of IVF for me was that the medication was timed specically for my cycle and helped with some of the roadblocks. An error led to the failure of the first cycle of IVF before the implantation stage. “We were devastated as this was supposed to be our miracle moment, she said. The clinic offered them a second cycle, so the couple ed to Cyprus in February . Four weeks later, Jo and Jason went to Cartagena to find out the positive result via a blood test.  She said: I had to have IV intralipids immediately after the test came back positive and continued to have those throughout the pregnancy. I also had strong steroid injections and daily heparin injections- the approach was a lot more aggressive and wasnapost very nice, My fertility coach, who dealt with complicated pregnancies, meditation and hypnosis helped me find my centre and made me more mentally prepared than ever before, Even with the positive result, Jo was never complacent. “Our hearts were in our mouths the entire time, she said. We kept thinking that this was the miracle for us and everything must be falling into place. “Then it all started to happen, step-by-step. “With every scan and every week I was petried. Jason had me wrapped in bubble wrap - but I was treated as high-risk and I had appointments or scans more-or-less every fortnight.  “There was never a moment when we thought ‘Thank goodness for that it’s all going to be OK’. “Throughout the whole pregnancy, right up to delivery, we held our breath. She went into labour but  hours after her waters broke her baby still hadnapost arrived, so she had an emergency c-section on October . Jessica Rose, now  months old, was born healthy, weighing .lb. She said: In the end I had a caesarean and she was delivered in  minutes, but both my husband and my translator had to wait outside so I didn’t have much idea what was going on. “I was quickly whisked into recovery and had to stay in hospital for four or five days, but I just couldn’t wait to get back home. “Even when she was born I had to keep checking she was really there - I still can’t believe it happened for us. I still check now, but every week she becomes more real. “People see it as a selfish thing to continue after so many failures and this is why it’s a dficult subject - people just don’t understand why I would do it.

Recalling the day Gill, who had lung cancer, died in hospital, John, , says: “I made a pledge not to close our doors to animals that needed us. “Gill was pumped with morphine but suddenly sat upright... and then she just died in my arms.” The couple had helped ban the eating of dog and cat meat in Thailand and were a driving force behind the Soi Dog Foundation, tackling the problem of stray dogs and cats. After Gill, , died in , John and his team carried on their mission to neuter and care for stray animals. Now the couple have been awarded a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Award for their Outstanding Contribution to caring for man’s best friends.John says: “This award should not be for me, it’s for Gill and Soi Dog and our supporters. Gill’s the bravest person I’ve ever met. If anybody deserves this award she does.” John and Gill, both from Leeds, got married in Phuket in Thailand in  and fell in love with the island. John says: “I had a dog, Gill had three cats. We got another dog after we got together. We did a bit of voluntary work at the local Dogs Trust kennel. Gill was the love of my le. “We were opposites in a way, she was very outgoing, I’m not particularly. We complimented each other.” They went to Phuket regularly on holiday and eventually planned to retire there, but one thing always disturbed them when they visited. John says: “When we came here on holidays we talked about trying to do something about the horrendous problem that existed with stray dogs. “In those days there were an estimated , stray dogs, the conditions of them appalling. Most of them were skeletal and covered in mange, on every street corner you’d see stray dogs.” So when they moved to the Phuket they devoted themselves to helping thousands of street dogs and cats. John says: “We decided the only humane way we could do something about this was through large-scale sterilisation.”  They met a Dutch woman who had set up a charity called the Soi Dog Foundation and in  joined forces, deciding the best long-term solution to the dog and cat problem was a mass spay and neutering programme. Every day and night they would go out tranquillising stray dogs so they could be neutered and then recover at the shelter, now named after Gill. Hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats have been neutered since, including more than % of the stray dog population in Phuket. Crucially, Gill and John were involved in drafting legislation to make it illegal to eat dog and cat meat in Thailand. John says: “We have grown a lot. Thailand now has an animal welfare bill and the consumption of dogs and cats is now illegal. “We helped put an end to the dog meat business and the trade of dogs from Thailand to Vietnam, as well as the local consumption and skinning of dogs for fur.” In , while rescuing a dog from a flooded field, Gill contracted a rare form of septicaemia and lost both her legs.  John says: “She darted this dog and had to go into a flooded field to get it because it ran off. She dragged this dog out of the field so it wouldn’t drown. “The next day she did this big party in our house, she loved to cater for our friends, but that day she said she didn’t feel well and went to bed. “By the next morning she was in agony, I took her to hospital and her legs turned blue. I was told it was unlikely she would survive andshe did she’d lose her legs and arms.” Gill survived and did not lose her arms, and soon all she wanted to do was get home to John and her animals. John says: “Three days before Christmas she told the doctors she was determined to be home with the dogs and cats.She wanted to be with friends at Christmas, she’d always do a big Christmas dinner and cooked dinner for  people from a wheelchair. She wouldn’t have any help.”Gill battled back to health, continuing to work alongside John, and together they built a huge complex of shelters to help rescued dogs. They also established an overseas adoption programme for pets.

A pioneering experiment immersed more than , participants in dferent natural environments and monitored their emotional responses. The volunteers had a number of psychometric tests before and after being exposed to scenes such as meadows, mountains, waterfalls and urban environments. Contributors also had to rate their stress and wellbeing levels before and after being immersed in the natural environment. The study, led by i media research at Goldsmiths University of London, on behalf of plant powered snack brand, ZENB Veggie Bites, found water was the most effective at increasing positive emotions, such as happiness and inspiration. In total,  per cent reported that they felt an increase in happiness and  per cent felt inspired after watching scenes of water environments. Waterfalls were the most effective at boosting creativity and determination, while meadows and fields were most likely to enhance energy and trigger excitement. Seas, lakes and rivers were associated with the highest percentage changeacross participants’ perceived abilities to perform cognitive tasks after being immersed in the environment. The study showed how nature can also provide a tonic for those working from home, helping ease feelings of burnout for  per cent of participants. More than a quarterfelt more productive, and a further  per cent said it gave them a sense of perspective they needed. Meanwhile, the research highlighted how woodlands can have the most restorative effects on people’s thoughts. Almost six in participants admitted the environment helped them forget their worries and  per cent said it helped give them clearer thoughts - more than any other environment. And fields and meadows increase feelings of excitement and can lead to a boost in energy levels. Anna Stewart, from the i media research lab at Goldsmiths University of London, said: “This research is a step towards understanding the link between nature and specic mood states. “The findings show that water environments are linked more frequently to signicant changes in mood when compared to urban settings, demonstrating the power of more awe-inspiring settings like waterfalls, seas and lakes for improving mood and decreasing negative emotions. “These settings were rated as more attractive and more novel by our sample, suggesting thatyou’re looking for a mood boost, it’s best to choose an environment that you like, but that you don’t get to see or visit very often as this should have the most positive effects on your mood.” The scientic research, created in conjunction with ZENB Veggie Bites, was backed up by a separate survey of , adults exploring attitudes towards the outdoors on emotional states. It found the average Brit deliberately goes into nature to de-stress, relax or unwind just five times-a-month. And three-quarters agree that getting out into nature has been ‘more important than ever’ for their physical and mental wellbeing in . Six in  said being in nature helps reduce their stress, while  per cent believe it helps them to stop overthinking. A fth of the UK adults, polled via OnePoll, even said getting out into nature can help reduce their anger levels. Inspired by the findings, ZENB has launched a new podcast series ‘Bites of Nature’ hosted by Jasmine Hemsley. The five-part series draws on Jasmine’s and her guest’s personal experiences of the great outdoors, featuring TV presenter AJ Odudu, botanist and TV star James Wong and more.

The Santa’s Magical Drive Thru Adventure in Hull has been set up to transform East Park into a winter wonderland until Christmas Eve. But a string of what organisers called teething problems on the opening day resulted in negative feedback from parents Parent complained the experience was nothing like the description. One Hull mum, who paid £ to take her three children, referred to it as “one of those horror show walk-throughs” after being greeted by a terrying Grinch in a trip “faster than a McDonald’s drive-thru,” reports Hull Live. Have you suffered from a similar experience  We want to tell your story. Email webnews@mirror Mrs Claus missed her bus while Elsa got her timing wrong, organiser Martin Holland admitted. But he said lessons were learnt and the problems have now been sorted out. “We paid £ and the experience lasted no longer than a minute,” said the -year-old mum-of-three. “I wasn’t expecting Disney Land magic but after the year we have had it was disappointing. “It was nothing like the description. Half the characters were missing.  “We drove in and was greeted by The Grinch who to be honest was like the stuff of nightmares and at that point it felt like we were in one of those horror walk through things.” Mr Holland admitted that there were a number of problems on the opening day: We organised this months ago with the council but we had to stop it and refund the money. Obviously, the government allowed drive-thru grottoes to go ahead and we had six days to put it together. We didnapost get it one hundred per cent right yesterday. Lessons were learnt and the problems have been sorted out today. Mr Holland also disagreed saying with reviews, saying The Grinch did not look scary and that there was a lot of positive feedback about the character on the opening day.  I think he was fine, he said. He made people laugh. We have had good comments about him. I told him to not go too scary because normally they will pull up in front of you and pull at your wipers. But, he has been laughing and dancing. Marie Embling, who took her two kids to the drive-thru, said that it looked more like an abandoned fair. The -year-old from Brigg, North Lincolnshire, said: Donapost get me wrong for £. each I was not expecting the North Pole but I must admit we were left totally disappointed. We drove up to the first part that looked nothing less than an abandoned fair. Not sure what was meant to be happening in the inflatable grotto but nothing was there. In the globe there was certainly no snowstorm never mind Elsa as promised. We briefly saw the Grinch but it was raining so didnapost come out of his house. Highlights of the show were meant to include a snow blizzard with Frozen’s princess Elsa, which children were excited to see. But she was nowhere to be seen for the first few hours of the day. The East Hull mum continued: “That’s the first area. The Grinch sort of stalks your car for a bit and then you drive to Santa and get your gt bags then go. “Honestly, the whole thing was faster than a McDonald’s drive-thru. “That is literally it. The snow globe was not switched on and there was no Elsa as promised which my daughter was excited about. “Nothing was as described but I will say the Santa was authentic looking. It was fine, I can’t grumble about that.” Mr Holland says he was unfortunately let down on the day after a number of characters failed to turn up. He said: Mrs Claus didn’t turn up as she missed her bus and rang to say she couldn’t get here and I had to get someone  into the costume. Same with Elsa. She got her timing wrong and came after pm. It should have been earlier but apparently one of her kids was ill. It is the first day. I don’t like these comments but I know from everything I have done in the past that you are not going to please everyone. But I take on board everything and I am tweaking it. You are always going to get complaints but I think we are on top of it now. We are back on track.

defeat at Easter Road.There were signs that maybe, just maybe, he could still turn things around.Not picking up all three points against Arbroath in the league today, however, and my story is back on.See what I mean about a broken record Dundee boss James McPake says recent weeks have been toughest time of his footballing career\" title\"#Dundee boss James McPake says recent weeks have been toughest time of his footballing career# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-boss-james-mcpake-says-recent-weeks-have-been-toughest-time-of-his-footballing-career embed # secretXLeIoyTks\" data-secret\"XLeIoyTks\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"It’s all well and good putting in a heartening performance against a high-flying Premiership side like the Hibees, but Arbroath at home is an entirely dferent thing altogether.That kind of outcome just won’t do for the Dark Blues, I’m afraid.They must win at Dens today, it’s as simple as that.Eventhey weren’t in their current slide, that would be the expectation among the Dee support, unable to voice their all-apparent discontent in person at the moment.Given their current circumstances, not even a draw and another good display would do for under-fire boss McPake and struggling his side, in my opinion.Anything other than victory, all three points and progress up the Championship table, at long last, should leave the Dundee hierarchy seriously questioning how they move forward.I sincerely hope that is not the case, though.Genuinely, I am willing McPake on to, finally, get things right after so long threatening to do so.Hopefully, he can get the Dark Blues dancing to the same beat and back in a rhythm before long.Finding that groove won’t be easy, that’s been the story of the -year-old’s whole tenure, but there are promising signs the Dee have finally found some kind of settled line-up after being dogged by injuries and Covid.If he can get the men he trusts to deliver for him on the park against the Red Lichties today, there’s no reason why they can’t overturn Dick Campbell’s side.After all, Arbroath have hardly set the heather alight this term, in stark contrast to taking the league by storm the previous campaign.Of course, they, like many others in this tough second tier, always pose a danger, but Dundee can’t afford to think too much about the opposition when so much is at stake in terms of their own situations this afternoon.They have to get the turntable that is their season and their gaffer’s reign spinning again.Quite simply because you can blow fluff out of the needle all you like but , your vinyl is scratched beyond repair, it’s maybe time to get a new record and find a sound you’re happy with.Losing the nucleus of a successful crew to Covid- isolation couldn’t have come at a worse time for a Dundee United ship that was sailing along smoothly.Minus Micky Mellon, his back-room team and nine first-team players for  days, what was already a big month ahead has taken on added importance for a Terrors side on a seven-game unbeaten run.With United facing six tough tests in December, including clashes against the likes of Rangers, Celtic and Hibs, potentially being so heavily weakened could prove hugely detrimental to their hopes for the campaign.Added to that, the Terrors have fallen to sixth without a ball being kicked courtesy of Motherwell picking up six points and six goals because of the SPFL’s ruling againstNow, though, it’s a test of United’s resolve in the most trying of circumstances.From what is left of their football staff and what fixtures they will have to face, they need to find a way to stay on course.United have already shown their willingness to put faith in the likes of youth coach Thomas Courts, taking control of the first team, and it is clear it will require effort from other background figures to pull the club through this.Let’s just hope whoever is out s minus the cabin fever!With your manager, the rest of the first-team coaching staff and nine players ruled out because of the coronavirus, you would expect Dundee United’s trip to Livingston today to be postponed.That may well be the case.Dundee United: Nine players self-isolating as coronavirus crisis deepens ahead of Livingston and Rangers games\" title\"#Dundee United: Nine players self-isolating as coronavirus crisis deepens ahead of Livingston and Rangers games# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp breaking-nine-dundee-united-players-self-isolating-as-coronavirus-crisis-deepens-at-tannadice embed # secretlazBrhcpy\" data-secret\"lazBrhcpy\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Given what we’ve seen this week with the SPFL fining St Mirren and Kilmarnock and forfeiting their Covid-affected matches, the league are backed into a corner.United will fear any potential repercussions for rearranging the fixture.

They had to be.Coming so soon after that horror show, the authorities had placed a huge amount of trust in Dundee to put on an event that would bring pride back to the national game.They were not disappointed.The senior police officer in charge of crowd control said: “I just can’t praise the supporters enough. In the park itself their behaviour was first-class.”An ambulance service spokesperson added: “We didn’t have to deal with any fighting before, during or after the match. The fans were excellent.”Dundonian blood wasn#t spilled but it flowed through this memorable occasion.A toss of the coin decided the match would be played at Dens, an outcome that would have been cheered more loudly by the United team than the “home” side because of their love of playing in their rivals’ backyard.Not only did the clubs both hail from the banks of the Tay but so did the referee, with local whistler Bob Valentine handed the honour in a gesture that deserves to be applauded even all these years later. It was a brave show of imagination from the blazers, not something you see too often.As well as bragging rights and silverware, a place in the next season’s Uefa Cup was on offer in this First Division v Premier League contest.Tom Lauchlen, then Scottish Football League president, went all-in on the award of the prestigious tie to the city.He said: “And so, on with the game, which is widely accepted as the most interesting confrontation in the history of the competition. No matter the outcome of today’s match, surely the citizens of Dundee in particular, and football in general, will benefit.”In a storyline that would have been at home in a Broons annual, a wedding was saved by the police just as kick-off approached.Margaret Etchells, of Sandeman Street, who lived just yards from Dens, was getting married at pm to Alexander Edwards in SS Peter and Paul Church. An area in front of her house was cleared for taxis and a police escort was laid on to get her to the church on time as masses of fans converged on the stadium.The scene for the match – the sporting one this time # was set in the programme by the stylish prose of that era’s football writers.The Courier’s long-serving reporter Tommy Gallacher touched on events in Glasgow earlier in the year, writing: “Dundee is being presented with a heaven-sent opportunity to prove to everyone that intense rivalry need not be associated with violence of any kind. If Dundee and Dundee United achieve this then, regardless of the outcome, there may be broken hearts but no real losers.”Locally-based journalist John Mann, working for the Daily Star at the time, declared: “On this unique day, Dundee is the capital of Scottish football.”The late, great Dick Donnelly provided a superb article on Tannadice boss Jim McLean that must have given United fans reading it goosebumps as they awaited kick-off.He wrote: “It was nine years ago last Wednesday that the Dens Park coach made the short trip across the road to Tannadice to succeed Jerry Kerr as manager. Long enough hidden away in the backwoods of our national sport, United have, during McLean’s reign, progressed almost beyond all recognition.”As usual, Dick was correct and United would go on to reach even greater heights under McLean both at home and abroad.A huge part of the club’s success was, of course, down to legendary captain Paul Hegarty.The central defender, even  years on, looks back on that day with enormous pride.Famously, he chose not to be first to lt the cup himself but instead gted the honour to long-serving keeper Hamish McAlpine, a generous gesture agreed upon by every other player without the goalie’s prior knowledge.By coincidence, the aforementioned match programme had a sketch of Hamish on its front page, holding the cup along with Dark Blues’ number one Bobby Geddes.Maybe someone knew something the rest of us didn’t…Recalling, four decades on, how he decided to make a skipper’s sacrice on one of his proudest days in tangerine, Hegarty said: “We had discussed it as a group before the game, without Hamish being involved.“We were conscious of tempting fate because anything can happen in finals but we wanted to have a plan in place just in case.“The decision was taken to let Hamish lt the trophywe won because of the service he had given United.“He had been through all the ups and downs over the years and we wanted to give him recognition.“I didn’t think twice about it.“It had happened in Spain a few times at the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid soit was good enough for them it was good enough for us.“We had a magnicent club servant in Hamish and wanted to do what’s right by him.“When the time came I said to him to go ahead of me and, after some reluctance, Hamish enjoyed his moment.”The teams were:Dundee: Bobby Geddes, Les Barr, Erich Schaedler, Cammy Fraser, Bobby Glennie, George McGeachie, Peter Mackie, Ray Stephen, Eric Sinclair, Billy Williamson , Andy Geddes .Dundee United: Hamish McAlpine, Dave Narey, Iain Phillip, John Holt, Paul Hegarty, Frank Kopel, Eamonn Bannon, Willie Pettigrew, Davie Dodds, Paul Sturrock, Graeme Payne.Referee: Bob Valentine.Attendance: ,.Scorers: Dodds , Sturrock .Hegarty took us on a walk through the game asit had happened yesterday.After the Dark Blues had a Sinclair “goal” chalked off for a foul, Dodds put the Tangerines ahead right before half-time.Sturrock then pounced twice for United following two Hegarty headers, the first hitting the bar and the second parried by keeper Geddes.The United captain recalled: “Doddsie scored just before half-time with his header and I was behind him when he put it in – don’t ask why I was so high up the pitch.“They had the ball in our net before that but there was a foul on Hamish so that didn’t count.“It had been reasonably even until we took the lead so to score at such a vital time was brilliant for us.“I played a big part in our next two goals, with Luggyscoring after two of my headers.“For the first I got good contact on the corner but it smacked off the bar and came down for Luggy to nod into the net.“Because of how that goal had been scored, I was surprised when I got room inside the box again to put in another header, which was saved before Luggy made sure again.“I was just glad that he was in the right place at the right time, not once but twice.#Hegarty added: “I think it was a pretty comfortable victory in the end.“My main emotion at the final whistle was relief because you want the job done.“I was so happy for the United fans because it was a cup win against their rivals – a Dundee derby as well as being a final.“Can you imagineit hadn’t gone our way “We would be reading articles nowadays about how Dundee upset the odds. We couldn’t have put our supporters through that!”Hegarty pinpointed the previous season’s final against Aberdeen and that year’s semi-final second leg - success away to Celtic as the two performances that gave the Tangerines the edge for this one.He said: “It is hard to explain just how much confidence and momentum we took from having won the trophy the year before.“In the first final match at Hampden against Aberdeenwe actually carried a lot of luck and they were the better side on the day.“That all changed when we went to Dens for the replay, though, and we ran out deserved winners against an excellent Aberdeen team.“We were just a confident bunch back then and believed in our ability as a group of players.“What helped enormously for the Dundee final was having won our first bit of silverware just  months previously.“We were over that first hurdle and were feeling good about going back across the road, a pitch that suited our style of play.“Also, we had recorded an exceptional result in the semi-final by beating Celtic - at Parkhead after a draw at Tannadice in the first game. You always took heart from winning in Glasgow against one of the Old Firm.“On the day, there was some pressure on us because we were favourites but it wasn’t a problem because of that self-belief.”The late and much-missed Ron Scott, reporting from the Dens final under his Sunday Post byline Bill McFarlane, spoke to McLean after full-time.The victorious boss typically deflected praise away from himself.Instead, McLean picked out Graeme Payne for a special mention, having left him out of his line-up for the  success against Aberdeen.McLean told Ron: “I won the League Cup for my we, two sons and especially Graeme Payne.#Paul Sturrock was the man of the match but I’m delighted for Graeme. He typies the best of Scottish football.“I had to leave him out of last season’s final for tactical reasons…so I’m exceptionally pleased he had his moment of glory here.”He also caught up with Dundee manager Donald Mackay and got an answer to the question every Dark Blues’ fan was asking when their team was read out: “Where was winger Jimmy Murphy ”Ron reported Mackay as saying: “United treated the game like the cup-tie it was. We didn’t. It was as simple as that.”Asked about Murphy’s omission, Mackay added: “Jimmy was disciplined after Wednesday’s reserve game against Raith Rovers.#Players cannot be allowed to play for Dundee when they feel like it. They must produce the whole time.”Murphy’s absence was all the more extraordinary because of the starring role he had played in the games that got the Dens men to the final.He scored a penalty in the shootout at Rugby Park when they edged past Kilmarnock in the third round tormented Aberdeen at Pittodrie as Cammy Fraser’s goal sealed a superb quarter-final success and covered every blade of grass in the - semi-final, second leg thriller against Ayr United at Dens.For one Tannadice player, the success earned him a noteworthy city double.Just seven years previously, midfielder Iain Phillip was in the Dundee team that lted the League Cup at Hampden by beating Celtic thanks to Gordon Wallace’s goal.Now he was in the United side, collecting a medal at the expense of his former club.The last word on the Friendly Final goes to an unnamed but happy United fan, who called the Sunday Post office that night from the Vennel Bar on the city’s Hilltown.No doubt helped by a pint or two, he reported: “There are  Dundee and United supporters here and we’re all having a sing-song and enjoying ourselves. Put this on your front page. It’s the sort of thing that does the city proud.”~ First round, first leg East Fe  United .Scorers: Milne , Ward, Sturrock , Narey.Second leg United  East Fe .Scorers: Ward , Hegarty, Payne.United won - on aggregate.~ Second round, first leg United  Cowdenbeath .Scorers: Bannon , Sturrock, Hegarty.Second leg Cowdenbeath  United .Scorers: Hegarty, Ward , Sturrock.United won - on aggregate.~ Third round, first leg Motherwell  United .Scorer: Addison.Second leg United  Motherwell  .Scorers: Sturrock , Holt, Milne.United won - on aggregate.~ Quarter-final, first leg Clydebank  United .Scorer: Bannon.Second leg United  Clydebank .Scorers: Ward , Sturrock, Hegarty.United won - on aggregate.~ Semi-final, first leg United  Celtic .Scorer: Bannon.Second leg Celtic  United .Scorers: Pettigrew, Sturrock, Dodds.United won - on aggregate.~ Second round, first leg Dundee  Arbroath .Scorer: Fletcher .Second leg Arbroath  Dundee .Scorers: Sinclair, Fletcher, MacLaren.Dundee won - on aggregate.~ Third round, first leg Dundee  Kilmarnock .Second leg Kilmarnock  Dundee .Dundee won - on pens.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays scarily good halloween artists","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The spooky ride took  minutes and was clearly a highlight of the day as everyone is desperate to do it again another time with a dferent theme.The Campbeltown contingent of the club turned out in force and had a very successful day relishing the challenge of Sheila MacCallum’s clever Covid-busting games which had them racing up and down the arena while having to skilfully steer their ponies.It was truly a day of fun and laughter and a huge thank you from the club to everyone who helped to make this a memorable, happy day for so many in these dficult times.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space, who cut into the box and picked out MacEwan, who was foiled from six yards by Lewis. The keeper couldn#t hold the shot, and the ball eventually fell to Gavin Forgrieve, who tapped home from four yards.Nine minutes from time Saints midfielder Bonar, a key member of Red Star#s  Premier Division Two title-winning side, passed to MacEwan, who beat the keeper with a deft chip from  yards.Match report and photographs: Derek Black"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation. It should have been two or three to get proper feedback.#Officers said what was happening and it was an option that nobody knew about.#Everything has been massaged for the IJB’s benefit. They are not listening.#Councillor Mulvaney said in reply: #This paper is reiterating what we have already decided and we are reopening a debate we had a number of months ago.#We now have a board member going back through things to which officers are in no position to respond.#I know Ms Rhodick feels strongly about this issue but the decisions have been taken and you cannot make comments like those.#It is just not appropriate for a board member.

Evenyou are a non-believer or one who doubts in the existence of God, you can always say #Godyou are there please, please come and help me#.Give it a go and not only will it give you relief from boredom and loneliness when you pray but numerous other benefits will accrue – and, of course, dipping into a Bible will enrich your prayer enormously.Calum MacFarlane-Barrow, Dalmally."},{"url":null,"title":"oh christmas tree","story":"Kathie GrfithsUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

This really is it. Nothing .An alternative is to mix up a saltwater solution, soak a towel in it and leave the towel on the windscreen overnight.You might also want to leave the engine running while you de-ice your car, but this poses safety issues and may also be in breach of the Highway Code which states you must not leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road.Theres also the risk the vehicle could get stolenthe keys are left in the ignition.The AA says:Get up at least  minutes early to give you time to prepare the car.Donrsquot drive off like a tank-commander, with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen.Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer. Use a cigarette lighter to warm a key for a frozen lock.Plan routes to favour major roads which are more likely to have been cleared and gritted.Allow extra time for winter journeys but be prepared for the inevitability of being late for work due to unexpected delay.Can I be fined for not clearing my windows before driving away Short answer - yes.There isnt a law that says it is illegal to drive with snow on your car, however the Highway Code says that you must be able to see out of every window clearly during bad weather.If you fail to do so you could incur a fine, but more importantly could place your le, the lives of your passengers and the lives of those around you in danger.As for snow on the roof, while, again, there is no law stating it is illegal to drive with snow on your roof,it falls off onto your windscreen while driving or flies into the path of another car then you could be penalised for such offences as driving without due consideration or using a motor vehicle in a dangerous condition and again, not worth the risk.For more information visit the AAand RACwebsite.Please be careful when on the roads this week."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-records-seven-new-cases-24-hour-period","story":"THE Borders has recorded seven cases of coronavirus in the last  hours, taking the overall figure since March to ,.The Scottish Government published updated statistics at pm today .There are currently  people in hospital in the Borders after positive tests.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time.

Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder.

We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

For every dozen sold, p will be donated to the girls# fund.When staff at Jura Community Store, one of the shops selling the eggs, found out about the appeal, they decided that for every dozen eggs they sell in pink boxes, they will donate an additional p to Children st.Wearing T-shirts bearing the Children st logo and colours, the girls set off from Aqualibrium last Sunday morning, and were joined throughout their journey by Jessica#s big sister Adelle and her friend Jade McCallum, as well as Jessica and Adelle#s parents.Many friends and family members turned out to cheer and clap for the girls and there was even a special, hand-made banner which read: #Well done, girls!#Despite a drizzly shower, the weather was largely pleasant, meaning the girls could enjoy a few pit stops on their journey.They were welcomed at the finish line with balloons, cake, hot chocolate, medals and gts.The girls# parents said: #They smiled, danced and sang the whole way and, as they did, they spoke about the children and families they would be helping and how their Christmas might be now, as a result of the fantastic amount of money raised.#They were absolute stars and did so well. We could all see the pride bursting out of them which was lovely.#As always, friends, family and our community have just been so kind and supportive. Thank you to everyone who cheered them off, supported them along the way and welcomed them in at the end, it made the event so special for the girls.#And thanks again to everyone who has sponsored, we know the money will make such a dference.#There is still time to sponsor the girls as their online fundraising page # search #Friends walk for Christmas# on the JustGiving website # is being left open until the end of the month so the Deliciously Scottish Eggs donation can be added to the total."},{"url":null,"title":"district news december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Both schools have demonstrated rich, engaging and ied STEM experiences for learners.#Science Minister Richard Lochhead said: #Many congratulations to those schools who have achieved STEM Nation Awards.#The efforts of those schools to offer pupils the chance to develop skills and awareness of STEM subjects will open up fantastic career opportunities to them and help to make sure that the workforce of the future is equipped to protect Scotland’s reputation as a true science and technology nation.#Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly, said: #Here in Argyll and Bute, we have a track record for excellence in STEM learning experiences in our schools. With local key sectors that include creative industries, aquaculture and renewable energy, it’s important that our young people are well-equipped with skills our economy needs for the future – either at home or further afield.#So, congratulations to Port Ellen and Bowmore primaries, and good luck to North Bute Primary which I know has just completed the first step in achieving this award.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I started a blog about Rogan#s journey and hopeful road to recovery and now he#s becoming a local hero with people stopping me in the street and asking about him.#Now comes the figurative mycelium part. After hearing from Katrina, Ian started looking for wild turkey tail mushroom and finally discovered some, growing on a log in a garden in Southend.He asked Frances Hill from Muneroy Tearoom whose house it was and she, in turn, asked the ownersome of the mushrooms could be harvested, explaining what it would be used for.The owners, Mark and Sadie, were only too happy for Ian to collect some, which he delivered to retired herbalist Kenneth Eames, who has been shielding for  months.Kenneth said: #I went on a mushroom hunt with Ian about  years ago and we#ve remained friends since. When he askedI could make Rogan a tincture, I was only too happy to help.#I came to Campbeltown  years ago and the people made me so welcome and since my we and I have been shielding, people have been as good as ever. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to provide some small help to Rogan.#People being connected and helping each another seems so apt.

Susan had been previously unaware of it and so decided to go find it with her husband.When they got there, the tide was helpfully out, revealing the pool. She took some photos and a film of it, but when she ed home and looked at the film, she felt sure she could see a ghostly image in the water of the pool.This led Susan to research images of Lady Helen Hall and she reckoned the image looked like her. Was it a ghostly apparition in the water or a trick of the light  Well, people can make their own mind up, but for me, Susanrsquos message made me curious to find this pool and learn more about Lady Hall, after which it is named.So we made it a family weekend trip of discovery, which usually take place within the boundaries of East Lothian even in the best of times so this was perfect. Bilsdean and nearby Dunglass are favourite places of mine, as you will knowyou read my column regularly. Despite the busy A passing through, the whole area has a fascinating history and the walk following the burn down Bilsdean Glen has an enchanting waterfall. Reaching this walk from the village is hazardous, however, as an unsafe crossing over the fast-flowing A is required, so much care is neededyou go this way.We didnrsquot have much time. The timetable of the tides was against us, as was the dying light of a winterrsquos afternoon. However, we managed to reach the beach with just enough light and time to have our adventure. Susan and David were waiting for us and we made our distanced greetings and they headed in front to seethe pool had been uncovered by the receding tide.This part of the coast is utterly fascinating. There is a lot of erosion here, and whenever I come I see new geological features and wonder about them. Irsquom no geologic expert, but Irsquom sure we spotted a chunk of ancient volcanic lava which seems to have solidied in mid flow a moment in Earthrsquos story from millions of years ago.It was from near here, of course, that the geologist James Hutton was taken in  by Sir James Hall, Lady Hallrsquos husband, on a boat ride to nearby Siccar Point, and the rest, as they say, is history.But it wasnrsquot to retell the story of already-well-known men from history that we made this trip. It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson. She spent years researching the le of Lady Hall and, based on the titbits Irsquove managed to see, it looks fascinating.But I will alsoto the pool. There may be other stories attached to it, and now our story is part of it too.

As someone who has researched the minutiae of the hyper-processed, factory products our food retailers sell, MS offerings are broadly indistinguishable, in my ingredient and production method analysis, from its competitors.Irsquom also turned off by the actual images.As Dame Julie Walters drools away in classic MS food porn style, up come the greasy, fried, battered or breadcrumbed exhibits. If I saw them on a pubrsquos budget funeral buffet, Irsquod avoid them.First, the no-chicken mini kievs, a Plant Kitchen offering that contains no fewer than  ingredients. Next, the mini battered sausages that you dunk in a shimmering gloop going by the name of lsquocurry saucersquo. Last, but not least, the chicken doughnut dippers, a food manufacturerrsquos favourite. Each of these last offerings contains between  and  ingredients, depending on whether you count every component in each composite ingredient.Many of these ingredients would only be interpretable by a food technologist. What is nutmeg \"extract\" exactly  How does it dfer from the actual spice  Why doesnrsquot MS just use ground nutmeg  Why does the soy-based, no-chicken kiev contain anonymous synthetic \"flavouring\"  But these techno-food concoctions hit a spot. They appeal to that most stubborn aspect of the British palate: a weakness for a smidgen of anonymous proteinaceous matter, deep-fried in stodgy carbohydrate casing, and dunked in something sugary.Yet my friend, an able cook and someone who appreciates good food, is desperate to buy some. By the end of November she was already worried about how she could stock up on items on the MS Christmas list. Then she found that she couldnrsquot get an MS delivery slot this side of New Year anyway. Irsquove heard the same story about other supermarket chains.How did she resolve this  By going to a physical store, buying what she thought shersquod need, intending to freeze it, only to find that because of all the bulky packaging, it wouldnrsquot all fit in.ldquoWhy did I do this  shersquos now asking herself. ldquoItrsquos only one day of the year, after all.The explanation, we agree, is that women feel under extraordinary food, and therefore emotional, pressure at Christmas. They fret about meeting their familyrsquos expectations, and weeks-long Christmas food advertising campaigns pump up that anxiety. These adverts work as effectively on women as the Christmas toy equivalent work on children.And this year, the annual festive food pressure dial has been turned up to maximum setting. Memories of bare supermarket shelves during the first lockdown haunt us. The feeling that we must, against all odds, make this a successful Christmas to reassure ourselves, and our nearest and dearest, that deep down, everything is fine.Apologies to those relatively few men who take on the responsibility for planning and providing, but this is heavy burden that mainly women feel.Of course, this festive anxiety is orced from reality. There are shops other than supermarkets, independent shops. They usually sell better food, and they donrsquot run out. There are any number of smaller producers and distributors of first-rate food who would be delighted to have our online business.So letrsquos try to keep a cool head. Wersquove had enough panic this year already.Just remember that anyone who cooks, or who has any feeling for food whatsoever, can come up with something that is better quality and more delicious than those over-hyped supermarket reheats that never look, or taste, anywhere near as good as the enticing picture on the box."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-panoramas-iconic-red-deer-glenshee","story":"The place is Glenshee, on the edge of the Cairngorms National Park. Itrsquos known in Gaelic as Gleann Shith, the Glen of the Fairies, but itrsquos also the glen of the red deer, which graze on grasses, sedges, heather and woody plants and live in the Cairngorms in large herds. Except for during mating season the deer tend to stay in single sex groups and this image shows four stags foraging for food on a hillside which already has its first covering of snow, their antlers picked out in silhouette against the winter sky.If the image seems familiar or evokes a response therersquos a reason. Just under  years ago, in , the English painter Edwin Landseer journeyed north from his home on London to enjoy the first of several visits to the Highlands. It was during one of these that he made the sketch that would become his most famous work: The Monarch Of The Glen, completed in  as part of a three-painting commission for what was euphemistically known as the Refreshment Room at the House Of Lords. When the ermine-clad peers refused to stump up the pound fee, The Monarch Of The Glen passed through a iety of private hands and eventually ended up in the Scottish National Gallery. By then it had become roaringly popular and emblematic of what you might call the ldquobiscuit tin view of Scotland.Landseerrsquos stag has  points, or tines, to its antlers, making it a Royal stag rather the Monarch iety, which tend to have  points . An Imperial stag, meanwhile, would have  points. None of ours look like they can even muster , though they are no less impressive a sight for it.That said, you might smell them before you see them, especiallythey are present in numbers. Thatrsquos what happened to mountaineer Brian Shackleton, a descendent of polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, while walking in Glenshee in . Catching a ldquovery, very strong smell of deer as he crested a ridge he found himself looking at a grazing herd of between  and  deer. There were so many there was steam rising off them, he told a local newspaper.Deer produce considerable amounts of methane as well as steam, and large grazing herds can have a detrimental effect on plant le and bioersity. Accordingly, there are increasing calls for legally enforceable culls. Edwin Landseerrsquos romantic th century vision of the Scottish landscape is one thing, maintaining the living mountain in the teeth of st century environmental collapse quite another."},{"url":null,"title":"food-tricks-trade-former-bake-off-winner-john-whaite","story":"John Whaite, winner of the  series, set up his quaint cookery school in Lancashire in . A small group of us gatherin the delectable converted barn, whipping up chocolate silk pies with pear and caramel, cherry crumble blondies and the best carrot cake Ive ever tasted. Here are some of the things I learned on the way.... If your cake batter curdles - or any mixture splits when using fat, pop it over a bain-marieand whisk vigorously. If youre using a KitchenAid, warm the bowl with a blow torch, and then whisk. Do this quickly though - you dont want your mixture lurking over the hot water for too long.. When putting pastry in the fridge, flatten it into a disk, rather than balling it into a boulder, so you dont have to turn a big ball into a flat disk later.. If your pastry shrinks in the oven, it means youve overworked it. Start again!. Use a toothbrush to create pretty splashes when youre icing a cake.. Roast damsons in the oven and use them to make jam. The stones squeeze out easily after being roasted, and you can use the juice in your cake frosting .. Use a hot kne to slice your cakes up - this works especially well for fridge-cooled gooey brownies. Warm your kne up by dipping it in hot water.. To stop an icing-sugar dust cloud, mix the butter and icing sugar with the paddle by hand, pressing it down, before turning your mixer on.. Use egg yolk, a tiny splash of water and a pinch of salt for the perfect egg wash.. Use acrylic rods when rolling out pastry to ensure its the perfect thickness all the way through.. Always leave scone dough to rest - it takes  mins for the baking powder to get to work, to relax the gluten and give you soft, pillowy scones.. Weigh your liquid ingredients - jug measurements arent always right.. When you make pastry or dough, mix it in your mixer to start with, but bring it together by hand for a perfectly smooth consistency.. When making sweet pastry, use sugar not icing sugar. Icing sugar can make the pastry rubbery.. Use white sugar when making caramel, not golden, because its more refined, so there are fewer bits in it that might crystallise.. Use rice for blind baking, not baking beans - its cheaper!. When making carrot cake , grate your carrots into a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the grated carrot to help absorb even more.. Use paperclips to secure your baking paper to the pans - this stops it blowing around in a fan oven.. If your pastry breaks when you roll it out, simply give it a very quick knead, then put plenty of flour down and roll it out again. Have a pastry brush on hand to dust off any excess flour.. Le is too short to make your own puff pastry. Use ready-rolled, so long as its all-butter.For more information on John Whaites Kitchen, or to book a cookery course, visit johnwhaiteskitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-coming-new-dawn-suffused-happiness-give-thanks","story":"I electronically raise my shutters and myself, and look out to the still darkness and watch it gradually change content with its progress.Nurses come and go in a choreographed routine ndash pills, thermometer reading and then breakfast of good bread, butter, jam and cold, cold orange juice.

All seems logical, right and working to a good, positive purpose.I have started walking again ndash my Ferrari Zimmer parked up but there in case I need the additional security and the joy of unaided steps on so much stronger legs is almost beyond words, leading to pleasurable sighs instead.Then I think of Las Molieres and how there I would be manually opening and clipping back the shutters. Often, I would stand at the open French windows, shivering slightly in the mist which seemed a daily morning occurrence where we are.I would range my eyes from the distant village church glimpsed through the now bare upright arms of the woods over to the crossroads ing into the valley or turning towards Lavit.And I would listen to heavy silence broken only by the rush of Cesarrsquos body racing back from his check of the land that all had been well in the night.And that mist, like the hospital darkness, would dissipate toohellipslyly sneaking away to let the weak light come forth and the sky show its glory.Then, vaguely discontented and already bored, I would make a cappuccino from a sachet, open the computer and begin the morning read of the papers.Ah,I had only known what was rushing towards me, already multiplying and festering in my cells, how much more would I have relished such mundanities.Perhaps thatrsquos why I now waken with such surreal happiness because now I know.The serenity and the certitude grow less and less as afternoon turns into frighteningly early evening and darkness falls and I press the shutters for theirdownward journey.It depends what the next day holds as to how quickly the mood evaporates and the demonsto bicker and debate in my brain.Rosemary Gorings Country Le: steering a safe route towards winterAfter a break, the doctors are to give me immunotherapy tomorrow and I dread what may follow with a visceral fear.

That fills me with fear too in case something is lsquolostrsquo in the power of the radiation.And they now no longer feel I should be in London. They believe I should continue and end my treatment here so that there can be no risk of any delay at the other end.Logically I agree with them until I speak to my son who wants to come, sweep me up and into the Marsden who he says will immediately continue treatment.But Irsquove lived too long not to know that le does not always run on linear lines and much is out with our control at times.

An older building, the rooms are smaller and uglier, the corridors narrow and scuffed and I felt Irsquod been cast out of Paradise.But after treatments I need the presence of nursing care day and night and for this, the way the French system works, I will have to pay  euros a month.The same high standards and protocols apply the food comes from the same kitchen and my boiled eggs are safe. But the nursing teams are dferent and I will leave behind the great kindness of those who have cared for me all these months.The ones who know my foibles the necessity of plugs and placements for my Mac and phone the chair or table to hold them all.However, for now, for a few hours on the good days, starting with the coming of the dawn, I am suffused with happiness and for that I give thanks.

Does he think hersquoll see her again  ldquoZero chance.It was a Monday night a few weeks ago, he was in the shower when he heard barking and saw the outside security lights flash on. By the time he had dashed outside, Skye was gone, tucked under the arm of thief and spirited away into the foggy night.ldquoThey got lucky, he adds. ldquoNine out of ten times therersquos a padlock on but Irsquod just fed her and was going to take her for a last walk, he sighs.ldquoItrsquos probably breeders. Maybe Irsquoll see her in three or four years time when shersquos ten or  and no more use to them, and they throw her away.Meantime,he finds the person who snatched his dog from right outside his house, he may well struggle to contain himself from lashing out, he adds.Skyersquos theft was captured on CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. Despite social media appeals across a swathe of missing, lost and stolen pet pages, there have been no sightings and no news. Pinning down the precise number of dog thefts in Scotland is tricky. Police Scotland say their records of thefts do not break down incidents in a way that records inidual items ndash such as dogs.While without clear evidence in the form of CCTV images or eyewitness accounts, it is impossible to determine whether a dog was stolen, or simply took advantage of an open gate.But concern is mounting that a worrying spate of dog thefts across England - where incidents have soared since the start of lockdown in March, coinciding with rocketing demand for puppies and dogs - may begin to encroach on owners north of the border.And with pets fetching eye-watering prices on social media sites particularly among popular medium-sized breeds such as Cocker Spaniels and cross-bred lsquodesignerrsquo cockerpoos, the potential for thieves to line their pockets can be huge.ldquoA cockerpoo used to cost around pound, now itrsquos around pound,. A Cocker Spaniel that was pound is now pound, and a Jack Russell has gone from pound to pound,, says Katie McCandless-Thomas, who runs a Facebook page, Missing Pets, Perth and Kinross, Scotland.Her page recently led an appeal for four dogs stolen from two addresses in rural Perthshire on the same day in October. One, a Jack Russell called Harvey, was lted from his kennel at Meikleour while his stunned owner watched helplessly from his home.Harvey was later found, while of the other three, taken from nearby Forneth, West of Blairgowrie, two ndash both Jack Russells - were found nearly  miles away in the Midlands. The remaining dog, a Springer Spaniel, remains missing.A -year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with the two incidents.ldquoThis type of thing has gotten worse since the start of lockdown, adds Katie. ldquoDemand for dogs has spiralled, they are selling for at least double the price theyrsquod normally sell for, and I think dog theft is part of it all.ldquoThe price of puppies is fuelling demand for more pets and people are stealing dogs thinking itrsquos a quick way to sell them on.ldquoIt is bad enough to know your dog is missing, but when you suspect it has been deliberately taken, itrsquos a whole dferent situation.ldquoItrsquos devastating for the owners.ldquoThere is a feeling that someone has deliberately targeted their dog and all kinds of scenarios run through their head of what could be happening.In England, charity DogLost said dog thefts in England rose by  per cent between  March, when lockdown was announced, and  June, compared with the same time last year.Over the course of just two months  dogs were taken in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire alone, raising concerns that organised gangs are targeting mostly pedigree and working dogs, with Cocker Spaniels top of the list.As a result, some English police forces have suggested owners change their dog-walking routines, fearing gangs might be watching popular routes.However, social media rumours that gangs mark pavements outside dog ownersrsquo homes with chalk or cable ties are thought to be misplaced. ldquoA lot of thefts are opportunistic, says Katie. ldquoPeople leave their dogs tied up outside a shop and someone just walks away with them.ldquoPeople think it wonrsquot happen to them, but it can.In West Lothian, dog owner Siobhan Lamont waits every day for news of Tyson, a nine-year-old Staffordshire Terrier, and year-old Staffy-Collie cross, Drax. Both dogs vanished from the back garden of their home in Armadale at the start of October.ldquoI suddenly realised they werenrsquot in the house. I went outside, and saw the gate, which had been locked, was open, she says.A series of mystery phone calls have added to her distress and heightened her concerns that the dogs ndash last spotted in nearby Fauldhouse ndash are being kept by someone.ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, you donrsquot know what to do, she says. ldquoIrsquove since heard of so many dog thefts or dogs going missing. The house isnrsquot the same without them here.Earlier this month, a three years old chocolate-coloured spaniel called Obie, which had been snatched from a property in Harburn, West Lothian, was reunited with owners after being found  miles away in Penrith.According to Charlene Gun, who runs Lost  Found Dogs West Lothian on Facebook, dog thefts are not re in the area, but there is cause for concern.ldquoAre profits increasing for people selling dogs  Yes. Are the chances of thefts quite high  Irsquod tell anyone to never trust anyone or take any chances, she says.ldquoAre certain breeds more desirable and more likely to be picked up  Yes.ldquoWhen you are in a situation where one litter of eight puppies can earn someone around pound,, then itrsquos better not to leave your dog unattended.If Google searches for puppies and dogs in the wake of March lockdown is anything to go by, there is no shortage of demand: searches for lsquobuy a puppyrsquo rose by %, with lsquoadopt a puppyrsquo rising by %.As well as raising fears over dog thefts, demand has led to concerns of a growth in puppy farms.Just last week more than  dogs and cats were seized from a suspected puppy farm in Perthshire, including three pregnant bitches and three litters of puppies.Animal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA says it launched  investigations into puppy farming in October alone, and fears demand for puppies over the festive period would lead to a rise in the number of cases.ldquoThe combination of coronavirus restrictions and extortionate prices of puppies is being manipulated by puppy traders selling badly bred dogs, said Scottish SPCA chief superintendent, Mike Flynn.ldquoThere are things we would urge any buyer to do, such as insist on seeing the pup they are buying at the sellerrsquos home or premises with their mum.ldquoWe know many dealers are telling unsuspecting members of the public to meet them in a car park or public space to pass over the dog safely.ldquoThe seller will often be wearing a mask and afterwards they are impossible to get a hold of when the pup gets sick.He added: ldquoPrices have skyrocketed in  as responsible breeders scaled back due to the restrictions, yet demand increased as many people were stuck at home.ldquoNow, dealers can charge more than ever before and sell more easily than theyrsquove previously been able to.ldquoThe root of this problem is public demand. As we approach Christmas, we are frightened by the prospect of the general public flocking to these people to buy sick and ill puppies.ldquoThe onus is on every single person in Scotland to put this despicable trade out of business."},{"url":null,"title":"cost-covid-future-shopping","story":"The Daily MailRichard Littlejohn said he could not begin to get his head around the astronomical sums of money thrown at Covid.\"Doesnrsquot sound much when you say it quickly, does it  pound billion.

Technological innovation combined with a global pandemic has transformed the way in which employers and employees interact forever. The Covid- lockdown plunged almost half of all British workers into remote working ndash which looks to be their reality for the foreseeable future.Though a begrudged necessity for many during the ongoing pandemic, the benefits of remote working to both employees and employers have long been recognised. A  Stanford University study found that remote working boosted productivity by  per cent. Research has also linked remote working to improved mental wellbeing, as well as a reduction in sick days and employee attrition.Hybrid working gives workers the power to decide how, when and where they work best. Whether you like being around others or work better alone whether you favour in-person meetings or remote video calls whether you enjoy routine or prefer flexibility in your daily schedule ndash hybrid working caters for all. In doing so, employees enjoy greater work-le balance, improved wellbeing, and ndash crucially for businesses ndash report increased productivity.Working solely from home can be an isolating experience, and many miss the collective buzz that comes from working together in a shared physical space. Some even miss the commute, which can act as an important bookend to the day and a way to compartmentalise work and home le. Thatrsquos where a hybrid working model comes in ndash a chance to blend remote and office working, and reap the benefits of both.Within this time of immense change lies an opportunity for employers to foster a hybrid work culture centred around wellbeing, and unlock greater levels of productivity, engagement and job satisfaction in the process. But thatrsquos not all the increase in hybrid working has also instigated a sht towards a model which prioritises productive output over the numbers of hours worked.For many years, our shared concept of work has been defined by the simple premise that the more hours you put in, the more you get done. But the rise of the knowledge economy, combined with rapid technological innovation, has made equating productivity with longer hours feel like a relic from a bygone era. With more and more employers now realising their employees can be as or even more productive working from home than at the office, the emphasis has shted from simply fulfilling contracted hours to measuring quantiable results.Trust and communication will be critical to supporting a hybrid working culture. Thankfully, the mass uptake of cloud-based s like Microsoft Teams has strengthened the ability of many teams to communicate and collaborate, regardless of their proximity to one another. The onus will be on managers to use these channels to foster motivation, trust and autonomy within their teams. In doing so, they can emphasise that results and achievements are what ultimately matter, not just attendance.In a post-pandemic world, many people would like toto the office mdash but not completely. Once the health risk decreases and solutions to creating Covid-secure workplaces become more prevalent, we will see the true power of hybrid working in action. By embracing flexibility, autonomy and trust, employers can foster happier, healthier workforces mdash and boost productivity in the process.

She brims with enthusiasm as she explains her hope is to specialise in changing perceptions surrounding eating disorders.The choice is one close to her heart. Not so long ago, Katie was tottering on the brink, a tiny shadow of her current self being tube-fed and battling anorexia nervosa in a Glasgow hospital ward.ldquoLooking back, itrsquos very surreal, says the -year-old, who is now living in Fe. ldquoWhen you lose weight like that, your neuralshuts down, nothing is really working, and the first treatment is refeeding.ldquoThere was a lot of waiting to seehow Irsquod respond to that. It tooka while to get my head around the factI was in hospital.ldquoThen I had to learn what anorexia was, and so did my family. It wasa learning process for everyone.Itrsquos a sharp lesson in a dficult condition that an increasing number of families are facing.According to eating disorder specialist charity BEAT, there was a % jump in demand for its helpline services in Scotland between April and October compared to the same period in .Whereas normally the charity in Scotland would expect to work with about , people experiencing anorexia, bulimia or ndash in most casesndash binge eating over the course of a year, it now expects the number to be closer to ,.Anxiety, stress, isolation and depression during the pandemic have been blamed for fuelling the rise,while lockdown restrictions have also affected the way patients access support networks. Changes to treatment plans and the loss of routine have also raised the risk of relapsing.Now, with Christmas on the horizon, there is further concern that numbers will balloon further.In response, the charity has boosted its work in Scotland thanks in partto almost pound, of additional help from the Scottish Government. It has increased its helpline hours, launched a Covid- support group, The Sanctuary, and initiated a Christmas campaign designed to provide extra support for parents and carers.Those are in addition to weekly support groups for people withanorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder, and others who supportthem.The leap in numbers could scarcely come at a more pertinent time: a full review of Eating Disorder Services across Scotland is under way and expected to unveil its findings next spring. It has raised hopes for the introduction of a range of new procedures to make accessing treatment easier and faster ndash helping to avoid horric stories of people drting up to  years before they receive help.One of the clinicians involved,Dr Stephen Anderson, says it is an ldquoamazing opportunity to reflectupon current services and make recommendations for improvements.He added: ldquoI have lots of hopes for change from the review.ldquoOne really important issue is education and training so that eating disorders are detected early and people referred for appropriate treatment as soon as possible.ldquoWe know from experience and very clearly from what people have told us, that services need to work better together ndash with better communication and pathways of care.Katie recalls struggling for about two years, hiding her severe weight loss from her family until it became obvious something drastic was wrong.ldquoI think it started when I was about , I just knew something was wrong, she says. ldquoI knew I wasnrsquot eating as much, but I didnrsquot speak to anyone about it and it wasnrsquot something we were told about at school.ldquoIt got worse and worse. There were changes in my behaviour, but my mum and dad thought my anxiety was because I was struggling to integrate into high school. Instead, it was anxiety around myself that translated to an eating disorder.Her changing shape was easily hidden beneath baggy clothes.ldquoItrsquos a very sneaky illness. It made me a very secretive person. I didnrsquot know what was going on with me.ldquoLooking back it was horric it was one of the most horrible experiences.There are about . million people in the UK with an eating disorder, however, itrsquos thought the true number is probably higher. Worryingly,  per cent donrsquot seek help, despite evidence that getting support means they are nine times more likely to recover.And although eating disorders are generally thought of as a female problem, one in three people affected is male ndash earlier this year cricket star Freddie Flintoff opened up about his -year struggle with bulimia, while actor Christopher Ecclestone has also spoken of his anorexia battle.According to Emma Broadhurst, National Officer of BEAT Scotland, pictured inset below, the pandemic has provided a perfect storm for people struggling with an eating disorder.ldquoWe knew in March we would see an increase in people coming to us because they were not accessing their usual support in the usual way.ldquoEating disorders thrive on isolation, she adds. ldquoThey are sneaky, private illnesses andyou are isolating, by yourself, not going to work or not socialising in the same way you normally would, then eating disorders will thrive on this.ldquoBefore the pandemic, these cases might not have come to fruition in the same way. Now itrsquos coming out.With Christmas around the corner she warns there are particular challenges ahead for anyone with an eating disorder and their loved ones.ldquoThe routine is out of the window and all the focus is on food. We want people to know they have support, she said.ldquoAs a parent you feel powerless because you want to make them better, and you canrsquot. you feel powerless and very alone.It breaks your heart.If Christmas bringsan excess of food, lockdown brought its own troubling triggers for people with eating disorders, according to Mr Anderson, who is leading the review with Dr Jacinta Tan, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who led a similar review in Wales, and Charlotte Oakley, of Connect Eating Service in Glasgow.ldquoThere were issues at the start of lockdown with people bulk buying and we know lots of people with eating disorders said they could no longer get their usual, or safe foods, which was extremely anxiety provoking, he says.ldquoGyms and other places for exercise were closed and this caused huge anxiety for a number of people.ldquoThere have also been big changesin how services operate.Since the reviewrsquos launch in March, workshops have been held with people experienced in living with an eating disorder, with plans for further meetings with clinicians and representatives from paediatrics, community mental health teams, liaison psychiatry and paediatric dentistry.It is also expected to involve Scotlandrsquos medical colleges, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Physicians, and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Health boards and social care partnerships are also set to be consulted.Itrsquos hoped the review will lead to earlier access to treatment and better training for medical professionals.ldquoSometimes when people ask for help with an eating disorder, they are told that their weight and blood tests are satisfactory, so are told that nothing is wrong, adds Dr Anderson.ldquoWe know doctors get on average two hours of teaching on eating disorders the whole way through medical schooland postgraduate training. There is a similar lack of education and training for nurses and psychologists,adds Mr Anderson.ldquoIt is such an amazing opportunity that we have to review the current set up of services across all sectors and across the country, and then make recommendations about how we can improve services across the wholeof Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amADVERTORIAL: THAW Orkney works with many dferent organisations to reach those most in need of the services we can offer.

But I know that for families struggling now, February is still a long way off.“So I am announcing a £ million package to bridge that gap, and help others struggling most with the impact of COVID over the winter months.“It will include money to help people pay their fuel bills and make sure children don’t go hungry.“It will offer additional help for the homeless, and fund an initiative to get older people online and connected.“And, most importantly of all, it will provide a cash grant of £ for every family with children in receipt of free school meals.“The money will be paid before Christmas and families can use it for whatever will help them through the winter. That could be food, new shoes or a winter coat for the kids.“Families will know best what they need.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch. She will be joined by Skye councillor Calum Munro, chair of Highland Council’s Gaelic committee, and former Highland Council leader and fellow Gaelic advocate, Dr Michael Foxley.The online event is open to anyone with a keen interest in the language and participants can register by emailing kate.forbes.msp@parliament.scotEarlier this year a major study into the use of Gaelic in island communities concluded that the language will fall into obsolescence unless signicant changes are made in approach and strategy.A series of forums have been organised by Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan, and it is hoped that these discussions will determine appropriate next steps to safeguard the language’s future.Ms Forbes said: “Part of the research was done in Staffin and so it seems only right to speak to people in Staffin about the fragility of Gaelic. There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard. The recent research by Soillse clearly sets out the challenges facing Gaelic in terms of usage and transmission.“Now is the time to consult with communities and to set the agenda for language policy and planning efforts. This online meeting is the first important step in taking this agenda forward.”As well as the community meetings, there is also the option to submit written evidence."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/STRATHPRINT-1.jpg","title":"strath print grateful for support in trying","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is not too late to order Christmas cards from Strath Print in Broadford.“You may be pleasantly surprised at how cost-effective it is to have cards made from your own photographs,” said co-founder and director Peter Dunlop.Founded in , Strath Print’s specialities are graphic design and printing on paper.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year.. The group are inviting people to give feedback by th Decemberpossible."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CLLR-JOHN-GORDON-STORR-1.jpg","title":"making the case for targeted investment in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineConsulting community planning partners on the specic projects that should be included in the plan started last week, and the members of the Eilean a’ Cheo ward were keen to hear the views of voters in the next stage in the process due to take place in January. As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3511592.jpg--.jpg?1606925686000\n","title":"relaxation of sunday trading restrictions","story":"Retailers will be permitted to open earlier on Sunday  and Sunday  December.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council says the move will to support the local business community when the current Northern Ireland circuit breaker restrictions come to an end.It is hoped the additional shopping time will help with social distancing concerns and protect the community during these dficult times.A temporary relaxation of enforcement action against large food shops which choose to open earlier – ie from am to pm - on a Sunday to facilitate shopping for essential items for keyworkers, health care workers and vulnerable people including those with disabilities, in the lead up to Christmas, has also been agreed by Council.The same temporary relaxation will apply to all retailers for Sunday  December and Sunday  December, enabling these businesses to open from am.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Peter Johnston, welcomed the announcement.“This will help our businesses to make up some lost time coming up to Christmas and it should also assist with social distancing in our town centres on a busy Sunday”, the Mayor continued.“These arrangements are temporary and Council will keep them under continual review.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland ministers not adverse to taking covid vaccine jab live on tv","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

I#ll wait my turn until called forward by the Health Service.Meanwhile, his party colleague and Heath Minister Robin Swann has urged everyone to remain ultra-vigilant to prevent the spread of the virus as non-essential retailers prepare to reopen on Friday following the two-week circuit-breaker.We still have a number of crucial days left of the current lockdown measures and we need to fully maximise the benefit from these, he said.The more we stay at home and minimise our contacts with each other, the more we can push down infection rates.That way, we can protect each other and help give the health service some vital breathing space.The Health Minister also issued a stark warning that he will not hesitate to immediately recommend a further tightening of restrictionsCovid- cases spike again and threaten to overwhelm the health service.His comments come after the Department of Health on Sunday confirmed a further  Covid- deaths in Northern Ireland.A further  people tested positive for the virus.A total of , people have tested positive for Covid- in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began.The figures follow a warning from a leading epidemiologist that the easing of Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland will lead to a wide circulation of the virus.Dr Gabriel Scally said coronavirus cases were still high and that the Executive#s decision to end the circuit-breaker was setting the scene for a very bad January and February.In the Republic there have been no deaths and  news cases.The vaccine will start to be rolled out in Northern Ireland this week, with a vaccination programme to start south of the border within weeks, according to Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly.But there is reportedly a problem with #vaccine hesitancy# as up to % of people have said in surveys they would be reluctant to get the potentially le-saving shot.US President-elect Joe Biden started the ball rolling in the US with his offer to get the vaccine in front of a live TV audience, and the political party leaders in the Republic are now following suit.

Joseph Carter, head of the charity, said: During the first lockdown the shielding scheme offered vital support to some of the most clinically vulnerable people in our communities. This support, which ranged from guaranteed food delivery slots to exemptions from work, proved essential in keeping people safe and well. As we approach winter, these vulnerable people now must not only contend with the traditional winter concerns - but also concerns about coronavirus too. We cannot allow people to become cut off and isolated during these bleak winter months, Mr Carter said.Bernie Divin, who lives in Londonderry and suffers from severe eosinophilic asthma, works in a hospital and was initially told to shield at the start of lockdown in March.She later ed to work and supports theof shielding, particularly over the winter and until a vaccine is widely available. Ms Divin said: Shielding was an invaluable leline for people like me. I hope the Executive will look to restore shielding, and the support that comes with it, until mass vaccination is possible.

The costs of this deal are already very substantial and we wouldn’t be able to cope with a no-deal scenario.”PAMost ReadSpy-cam Northern Ireland doctor#s le flushed down toilet after losing career and marriageEx-UVF bomber caught putting on condom in Belfast Caffe NeroSt John the bomber: Grinning New IRA killer in guise he used to target prison officer Adrian IsmayThe £ Christmas dinner: Merchant Hotel tops price treeI didn#t gun down Pat Finucane: Mo Courtney denies being part of murder gang despite agent naming him as gunmanLatest NewsThe sex offender next door... , are residents in Northern Ireland towns and citiesEdwin Poots rushed to hospital for emergency appendix operationNorthern Ireland ministers not adverse to taking Covid vaccine jab live on TVDUP man flags up gaffe in Spiderman gameCovid- vaccine rollout: How it is all unfolding,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’.

He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection.

With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my view, the little magician was the greatest footballer the world has ever had the pleasure of watching. Its as simple as that. But, he was more than a footballer. He was an icon and it was fitting when the worlds greatest ever team, the New Zealand All-Blacks, recognised that. They carried out a black number ten jersey with his name emblazoned on it before last weekends meeting of the nations. Its just a pity Peter Shilton, a world-class goalkeeper in his own right, didnt have the same class. Yes, Maradona cheated with his hand of God goal against the England stopper. Some might say honesty is the best policy, but there is a time and a place to twist the dagger. And last week wasnt that time. googletag.cmd.push He may have had his problems off the pitch, but sporting stars should always be judged for what they do in the colosseums in which they perform. Maradona wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Of the nine mouths that needed fed in their home in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, his father was the only earner, allowing his family to focus on study. It was Diegos ability to control the ball like it was an extension of his body that alerted the scouts of the local Argentinos Juniors. And so the roller-coaster was taking off. He bagged goal after goal and soon he was in the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. In their La Bombonera stadium, which shook with sheer atmosphere on game day, he led them to the Primera Divisioacuten. But, after just  games he was off to Europe as Barcelona came calling. googletag.cmd.push The fact that he moved to one of the Catalan giants, who were Mes Que Un Clubwas one thing. What defined him for me, was how he carried the national team. That wonder goal against England in  was a letime in the making. If you watch footage from his time at Napoli, that was the perfect grounding. Diego dragged an unfancied horse to two league titles, Italian and UEFA Cups, he was kicked black and blue. As he was in that  clash with England. Like the streets of Buenos Aires, Naples was the school of hard knocks. He literally had to dance his way around potential leg-breaking tackles and making a mockery of England was a by-product of it all.     Maradona is just one of those players that youd love to watch in the flesh. The viral video on social media of him juggling the ball is part of his legacy. He was just at one with the ball...oozing class. I remember trying to watch the  World Cup Final from a distance in the Bushtown Hotel. On the way home from the Port, we called in for grub. I pleaded to get away from the table. By that stage, the Germans had levelled the game at -. Maradona huffed and puffed all during the game, but he made the crucial play. His through ball played in Jorge Luis Burruchagafor the winner. Its that type of instinct that separates the good from the great. And the thing about it, much of that craft is self-taught away from the training field. I was chatting to Dermot Heaney during the week, for a feature in next weeks paper. His ball-winning ability was honed from endless hours kicking the ball against a gable wall. Unbelievable – like legend - is an overused word. It should only be used for occasions like last Sunday to describe Joe Cannings four sideline cuts over the bar. For all the great coaching hed had access to, Id say it was perfected on the family farm or at Portumna pitch. Eoin Bradleys goal in Derrys  qualier clash with Down. Owen Mulligans wonder goal against the Dubs the same year. All moments of magic. I remember chatting to a defender who had played against Glenullin one evening. How was he supposed to know what Skinner was going to do next, when the man didnt know himself. Thats the x-factor that makes all the dference. It was encouraging chatting to Damian Cassidy this week about the new proposals for Derrys coaching plan. In particular, it was the committees research around Go Games and making them five-a-side for the very young. Why  To promote decision-making and flair. Alleluia. This is what we have been missing. Back to the days of jumpers for goalposts and playing in the back field until either it got dark, or somebody huffed and went home with the ball. Once you realised that the big boys were going to kick you instead of the ball, it was time to figure out a wat to play around them. The great players learn on the job, away from regimented systems where they are forced to play with one hand tied behind your back. Thank God for Maradona. For those too young to remember him, the constant barrage of footage should inspire the next genius.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People Before Profit councillor Eamonn McCann was speaking after new documents revealed by the Derry News this week showed that there are currently no engineered controls preventing potentially dangerous substances at the Mobuoy site from leaking into the adjacent River Faughan. The River Faughan provides water to , local homes and businesses. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas issued a consultancy tender asking companies to put forward plans to clean up the Mobuoy site where an estimated .m cubic metres of waste is located. googletag.cmd.push The tender is worth up to pound.m. Cllr McCann said the Derry News had done the environment a favour in publishing the government documents dealing with the dangers emanating from the dump at Mobuoy Road. “The documents confirm in stark terms what many environmental and community groups have been arguing for years. – that the dump contains dangerous substances with a potential to pollute the Faughan river, which provides water to , premises in the Derry and Strabane area - and that current arrangements for containment are not adequate. “The Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairsis at least now admitting what the environmental network The Gathering has been insisting for years now – that the Mobuoy dump poses a threat to health and well-being in the North West and must be dealt with as a matter urgency.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr McCann said the information published in the Derry News this week was telling. “But there’s a lot more we need to be told,” he said. “The process of obtaining and evaluating bids for the consultancy business will take months. “This is what we have become used to in campaigning on the Mobuoy issue - delay, and then more delay.” Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said that this week she had submitted a number of questions to DAERA Minister Edwin Poots on the current situation at Mobuoy. One of the questions asked for the Ministers assessment of the risk to drinking water, river quality and wildle from the lack of ‘engineering controls’ at the Mobuoy waste dump.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday.

Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas.

It is easy to imagine the frustration among the group at present.“Obviously with the way the season ended last year with us being relegated and it finishing early, we were just chomping at the bit to get going and get a good run at the league,” Burke said.“But it just keeps getting put back and put back and for players its as frustrating as hell. We did a six weeks pre-season and we thought it was going to start then, then it’s put back two weeks, and you go between being fit and being not fit.“We have a really good group, a very young group, but players who are willing to learn and willing to work. There are a good mixture of young players and older heads, but it hasn’t been too hard on team morale because we’re all looking forward to the season starting up.”A number of players have left Stute since they last played a league game back in February, but Burke stayed put, determined to right a few wrongs this season.“I probably could have gone where but when I spoke to Sean, I wanted to give it a proper crack this year,” he explained. “Last year I had so many injuries, I was out for eight to ten weeks with a hamstring and I couldn’t get going.“Being made captain was a big pull obviously because I’ve never captained a senior club before and it’s a big honour and big trust for Sean to put in me.“I don’t feel extra responsibility really but I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform. That’s the thing for me this year, to perform on the pitch. There are a lot of players in the team who are vocal and do all the talking but for me it’s just to set an example and perform.” googletag.cmd.push ProfessionalBurke takes issue with the refusal to class Championship clubs and players as non-elite, saying the decision makes no logical sense.“With our team having so many professional contacted players, Institute is run like a professional club, so there’s no half measures,” he continued.“It’s hard to see that, specially when you see even fans being able to go to those games. The way we’re training at the minute we’re not even allowed to touch footballs so it’s very, very frustrating but we’ll get there.“You see Derry City in the same city playing games, then you see Coleraine and they’re playing just up around the corner. What’s the dference  I’m sure the coronavirus doesn’t dferentiate, just because you’re seen as an elite player.”Stute are slowly but surely closing in on a full calendar year without kicking a ball in a league game, and Burke, like his team mates, is desperate to finally get back on the pitch.“Hopefully now on January , or even before that in the Northwest Cup we can play,” he said. “Obviously we would like to play couple of games before the season starts but the way things are going, you never know. We’re under no illusions that it’s going to be a hard year. There are a couple of teams that could go for the league, and with it only being  games you have to hit the ground running. We’ll give it a good go anyway. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To be honest, it’s depressing, especially the way the matches ended up. I always watch them but it was soul destroying at times. Watch LOI was something I suppose but the way it ended up it might have made people worse, because there was no heart in it this season. It was hard to watch.”Breaking from such a tradition has been a real wrench for Norman, and hundreds of other fans, and while WatchLOI has provided coverage of every game, it is still a world away from the real thing.“The game definitely isn’t the same,” he continued.“It’s always been Derry City, they are the only team I’ve ever followed. My da, me and my brother always stand together at the matches and we have done for years. He took us from ’ and it’s always been Derry. Eventhey weren’t winning, we still went, like a lot of people. They are just the heart of the town. Even the boys who don’t go they would still ask you how did the match go. You want to see them do well, but it just wasn’t there this season.“The matches were hard to watch as well, and it just got worse and worse. We were all on messenger watching it and we were all cracking up with each other. It was probably good for the them that people weren’t at the matches.”MissingBe it the smell of the chippy, the dodgy pre-match music, the roar of the crowd, calling the referee everything or losing yourself in a goal celebration, it has all been swept away.In its place is silence, and whilst the absence of fans has clearly affected the players, those same supporters are also dealing with a huge loss.“I want to go back,” Norman insisted. “I would go back todayI could. I would go stand there tonightI could, but the way things are now nobody knows what to do. Everyone in Brandywell Pride, our weekend was for the matches. I just worked until Friday and waited for Friday night, and that’s what I’ve done the last  years.“It’s been a strange season for everyone. We don’t know when we’ll get back either which is the scary thing about it.“Evenwe do, I don’t think it will be the same, with everyone squashed in. We would have stood in Block J for years, but it might not be the same for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International. It will be preceded at .pm by the Premier Junior final between Armagh and Cavan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick charity hosts presentations  ","story":"THE Le Change Changes Lives charity which helps those affected by mental ill health or addiction problems made a number of presentations to its service users last week.The Downpatrick group held a socially distanced ceremony at the St Patrick Centre, just a short distance from its Market Street base where it ed to recently after the easing of coronavirus restrictions.Eight of the charityrsquos participants were presented with their Level One ICQ certicates in hospitality skills funded by the the Asset Recovery Community Schemewhich is managed by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Certicates were awarded to Janet Smith, Natalie Mussett, Sarah Taylor, Michelle Quinn, Clare Higgins, Colm Young and Sonya Craig.One of the certicates was awarded posthumously to Marie Magee mdash who sadly died earlier this year mdash and was accepted by her husband, Mark.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it.

it was an unexpected vicious attack by another woman.ldquoAfter the attack I started to suffer from PTSD.ldquoI visited my doctor many times, how could I have PTSD ldquoI hadnt been to the front line.ldquoMy doctor told me it only takes one traumatic event or one moment when you believe your le could be lost.ldquoThe mental burden of PTSD is dreadful.ldquoI wouldnt wish that on anybody.ldquoIt has taken me over two years of my le to get to somewhere near normal and even now Im not the same person I was.ldquoThe writing was the escape I needed.ldquoWriting has aided my recovery so far and I would recommend this to anyone suffering from PTSD.ldquoAlthough Im left with the scars of PTSD, itrsquos is behind me now.ldquoWriting has now become a hobby for me and the sense of achievement - holding a published book in your hands that you have written is the best feeling.ldquoItrsquos great.Mrs Danter drew inspiration from a childrenrsquos book which she personally found horrying.ldquoI saw a childrens book called Dex and the Funfair by Paul Shipton.ldquoIn my opinion the story is shocking.ldquoEvenI wasnt part of the funfair industry myself, I wouldnt want my children to read such a book.ldquoThe worst part about this, is the book is fact that it is in some school libraries.The book details Dex smashing up a tin can alley stall and the stallholder giving Dex a prize to make him leave.ldquoThis is shocking on all levels, she said. ldquoAllowing children to read books like this at the age of five or six cannot be a good thing.ldquoMy second inspiration came when my nephew came on holiday with while we were on our travels, which in turn reminded me just how much fun it was growing up on the fairground.ldquoI decided to write Nelsons Funfair Holiday - a story about a little boy who goes to stay with his auntie who owns a funfair.ldquoThis story will give children a glimpse of what it is like visiting and growing up on the fairground.ldquoChildren in my opinion must have all the experiences le has to offer to broaden their minds ready for the wider world.ldquoTravelling fairgrounds are part of our heritage in the UK and across Europe.ldquoItrsquos our history, its who we are and we are all play a part in that, whether you grow up on the fairground or not.The Danters originally hail from Brynmawr.Goff Danter, an artist, was able to offer India tips and advice on illustrating the book which is her first having previously been commissioned to do pencil drawings under the trade name Romayne Art.Mrs Danter also has another book under her belt.Entitled Me and My Social Media, itrsquos a short, gripping story about the dark side of social media and how a perfectly normal family can be turned upside down.ldquoI am very proud of this book, she added. ldquoEverybody who reads it tells me they cannot put it until they have finished it.Nelsons Funfair Holiday costs pound. and is available from Amazon and Waterstones. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis morning it was announced the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyhad authorised the first vaccine as safe and effective on the basis of detailed independent expert review of evidence from large scale clinical trials.The Pfizer Biontech vaccine has become the first to receive MHRA clearance in the UK and  million doses of the vaccine will shortly be available for delivery across the UK, with Wales getting its allocation based on population.Approval from the MHRA is the first step of Walesrsquo roll-out plan, which has seen preparations on-going since May.There are still a number of stages which need to happen before the vaccine reaches those in highest need and is ready for use, but this process is expected to happen over the next week.These stages includeThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationfinalising and publishing their guidance for the whole of the UKFinalising training materials for staff and patient information leafletsTraining of experienced immunisers for this particular vaccineFinal legal frameworks to allow registered health professionals to administer the vaccine to patients need to be authorised by each Health Board in Wales.The vaccine - which needs to be administered in two doses - will initially be prioritised and available for those aged  and over, care home staff and residents and those working within health and social care.As further supplies become available and additional vaccines receive MHRA approval, a staged approach will see other groups offered the vaccine, based on risk of serious complications and deaths.Iniduals in the priority groups for a Covid- vaccine will receive an invitation from their employer or health board, providing information about the vaccines, telling them where to go and what to do on the day of their appointment.People are urged to wait to be invited, and not to ask their pharmacist or GP.The chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, said: ldquoIt is fantastic to finally say that the first Covid- vaccine has been given the green light.\"We know now that we have a safe and effective vaccine for use across the UK - this is the positive news I and so many across the country have been waiting for.ldquoAll our NHS organisations across Wales have embraced the challenge presented to them and are at the advanced stages of planning for the arrival of a vaccine.\"We have tested distribution and storage arrangements to ensure we can get vaccine safely to every part of Wales.ldquoTherersquos still a few stages we need to work through but once all these safeguards are in place, vaccination can begin.\"There will only be relatively small amounts of the vaccine at first, those who have been advised as most needing the vaccine first, through approved delivery mechanisms.\"A full announcement around the timetable for roll-out in Wales will follow in the next few days.The effects of the vaccine may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice on keeping Wales safe remains the same for everyone, warned the first minister.Mark Drakeford said: \"Todayrsquos news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel.ldquoWe know some people within our communities are much more at risk than others from the serious complications of Covid-, which is why the new vaccine is being prioritised to protect them first.ldquoWhilst these first doses are given at fixed sites and occupational settings, and to protect our NHS and social care services, we must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus: regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.Pfizer Biontech vaccine needs to be stored at ultra-low temperatures. These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edeadeebbbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fedaeefbbedfaad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
