Miss David claims his father wanted her to have an abortion          Georgina says her ex-lover is refusing to contribute towards the upkeep of their eight-month-old son, Henry          Georgie, 34, a legal aide from London, began dating James, 37, who owns a polo club on his family’s Lincolnshire estateDespite being owner of Leadenham Polo Club and a schoolboy contemporary of Prince William, Reeve has been assessed as unable to pay child maintenance because of the ‘modest’ income he receives from his family.In a letter from a solicitor acting on his behalf, the Edinburgh University graduate, whose ancestor fought alongside the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill.Georgie denies both claims, but the row has even caught the eye of senior Church of England clergy after it emerged that James’s mother, Henrietta, who also wants no contact with her grandson, was appointed a lay canon at Lincoln Cathedral just a month before Henry’s birth.Divorcee Mrs Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion.In a written response to that claim, the Bishop of Grantham said that while ‘Miss David came under great pressure’, there was no evidence that Mrs Reeve, who is also Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, was involved.A morally muddled saga then, and one which raises questions about sex, relationships and responsibility in this modern age of dating.Who, then, should be blamed for this sorry situation? And, above all, what does the future hold for the golden-haired, blue-eyed baby boy at the heart of it?Henry James Frederick David-Reeve, who shares both his parents’ surnames is, somewhat ironically, the spitting image of the handsome father he has never met.          James Reeve accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill          Divorcee Henrietta Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion‘It’s for Henry’s sake that I’m speaking out about this,’ says Georgie, cradling her son.‘He wasn’t planned, but the fact is that we have a beautiful baby boy and he deserves to have the best chance in life. I am struggling to cope financially, and I just want James to accept some responsibility for his son.’James Reeve sees things rather differently. A letter sent to Georgie by his solicitor says: ‘You entered a relationship with him which was meant to be entirely casual, with no commitment at all.’Meanwhile, Georgie has been receiving emotional support from a most unlikely quarter — James’s elder brother, William, who is heir to the family estate. He has not only been to visit his nephew but also became his godfather when Henry was christened in September.He hit the news himself this week after he collapsed in court as he launched a battle with his mother over the future of their family’s 230-year-old country estate.Old Etonian William, 38, says the future of the 18th-century Leadenham estate is at risk due to a bitter family row, not helped by the situation between James and Georgie.Meanwhile, Georgie remains hurt and angry at the way she has been treated. While she doesn’t deny the relationship was casual at first, she argues that she and James began to see each other regularly — at least every week — and their romance became more than just physical.‘We used to take my dog for walks together and go out for long lunches and dinners. Or I cooked for us here. Sometimes we used to get a takeaway and a bottle of wine and just lie in front of the television. He brought flowers. We became close. It started to feel more serious. We opened up to each other about our lives.’And what different lives they are.Georgie, the daughter of a Pakistani-born father and British mother, was raised in a terrace house in South-east London and attended an all-girls’ state school. She studied media at the University of Buckingham, but left before finishing her degree and worked as a VIP nightclub hostess at Chinawhite in Soho.In her early 20s, she began work as a secretary at a barristers’ chambers in central London, moved to Chelsea and joined a ladies’ shooting club in West London.James, meanwhile, is one of four children born to Peter and Henrietta Reeve, and grew up enjoying all the privileges that life in a family with a lineage stretching back to Edward III can offer — including 20-bedroom Grade II-listed Leadenham House on the family’s 3,000-acre estate. He attended Eton and after university, returned to the estate to pursue his love of polo.          Despite living at Leadenham House James Reeve has been assessed as unable to make child maintenance payments           Mr Reeve (pictured), the son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon who is accused of encouraging Miss David to have an abortionAn un-brie-lievable new home: Former cheese factory on a...\u0027There\u0027s no excuse for what he did\u0027: Victim\u0027s verdict after...Female former USA gymnastics trainer who worked with...Pedophile doctor Larry Nassar is transferred to notorious...Share this articleGeorgie insists she is no gold-digger and had no idea just how wealthy James was when she met him. ‘He’s actually quite scruffy,’ she says. ‘I bought him socks on two occasions because his had holes in.’Claims that she tricked him into getting her pregnant are rebutted.‘The accusation that I lied about being on the Pill or that I deliberately didn’t take it is ridiculous. The only person who can possibly know if I took it is me, and I know I took it.’Nevertheless, in June 2017 a home test revealed she was pregnant. At first, she says, James took the news calmly. He travelled from Lincolnshire and the pair attended an NHS clinic in North London offering pregnancy counselling and abortion services.She admits that at this stage, she was ready to consider a termination. ‘I was only five weeks pregnant and it seemed the sensible thing to do,’ she explains. But before they had the chance to discuss it, medical events swiftly overtook them.This dramatically impacted her feelings about the pregnancy.First, a scan suggested Georgie was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy — a potentially fatal condition. She was sent to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, where she was monitored until it became clear the pregnancy was not ectopic and she was suffering from a harmless cyst in her fallopian tube.‘It was a very stressful situation because it could have impacted my future fertility,’ she says. ‘James was wonderful, perfect in every way. He cuddled me and reassured me.’When she was discharged three days later, she returned home to find he had cleaned her flat and put fresh flowers in a vase.Soon after, they returned to the pregnancy advice clinic, again planning to speak to a counsellor about the possibility of a termination, but after another scan, Georgie was told she had suffered a ‘missed miscarriage’ — where an embryo dies but is not immediately expelled by the body. Medical advice for women suffering the condition in the first three months of pregnancy is to allow nature to take its course.Given that both she and James believed the pregnancy was over, she says, there was no longer any need to discuss a termination. Instead, they went away for a weekend to help her get over the ordeal, staying at the Victoria Inn hotel in Holkham, Norfolk.‘He was really lovely to me at that time,’ she says.But at a check-up at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in August 2017, Georgie was given the jaw-dropping news that she hadn’t miscarried at all. She was 13 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby.‘It was the last thing I expected,’ she says. ‘I could see a heartbeat. I was overwhelmed that after everything that had happened, here was a perfect little baby.’She phoned James to break the news. ‘He was completely shocked,’ she says. ‘I asked if he wanted to see the scan photos and he said that he didn’t, that it was too much for him to take in. He said he needed to speak to his mother.‘I understood that he was overwhelmed.’She claims she then had a call from Mrs Reeve. ‘During the conversation, she said James wouldn’t stand by me. She said that I should be aware that he wouldn’t be inheriting anything. There was no reasoning with her. She upset me so much that I hung up.’After that, she says, she and James maintained contact by phone but relations between them were ‘not the same as before. He wanted me to have an abortion but after everything that had happened and then seeing the scan, I felt very differently. I felt very pressurised by him and his family’The last time she saw James was at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Georgie says it became clear he still expected her to terminate the pregnancy.‘He kept coming in and out of the room on his phone and then he just disappeared and didn’t come back. That was the last time I saw him. It was such a brutal way to be left.’When Georgie wrote to James, telling him she had to ‘decide what’s best for our baby’, she received an email from his solicitor telling her: ‘He does not wish to have any contact with you now or in the future. However, he remains willing to support you financially with the previous plan to have a termination. Any financial payment would need to be through me.’Further strongly worded legal letters followed. One sent in October 2017 reads: ‘Frankly, our client feels that he was entrapped by you . . . Our client has only ever wanted to have children in the context of a loving, stable and long-term relationship and clearly that was not the nature of the relationship he had with you. Our client has no intention of having any involvement with your child.’    James Reeve has claimed he is a victim of \u0027entrapment\u0027 who is not paid enough to make child maintenance payments Extraordinarily, a solicitor’s letter was even sent to Georgie’s widowed mother stating: ‘Reports through third parties have led our client to be concerned for Georgie’s mental state.’It continued: ‘He felt that it was necessary to put on record his own position so that you know how best to help her.’ Henry was born on March 5, 2018 and Georgie texted James to say he was welcome to visit at the hospital, but she received no response. Requests to meet via a legal mediation service were also rejected.After she turned to the Government’s Child Maintenance Service, James complied with instructions to pay her £407.71. According to his solicitor, a further review by the CMS showed ‘he lacked a current salary and was only in receipt of a modest income from his family’. The CMS does not consider assets, but the Department for Work and Pensions, which oversees the service, is monitoring the case.And it is clear that Georgie is not going to go away quietly. When the Rector of St Luke’s wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln in August, he asked for an investigation into the ‘pastorally unacceptable situation which has clear safeguarding implications’.Writing back a month later, the Bishop of Grantham said an investigation had concluded ‘this is not a safeguarding matter’.

Miss David claims she was made pregnant by James Reeve - polo-playing Old Etonian son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon          Miss David met Mr Reeve in 2017 and the pair quickly began dating but she fell pregnant In the letter, copies of which were sent to both Georgie and Mrs Reeve, he added that: ‘Mrs Reeve does not deny the existence of Henry, though she has no relationship with him and does not want one,’ and said discussions had been held with Mrs Reeve ‘about how she might pray for Henry and perhaps in some future time be able to relate to him in some way that honours Mr Reeve and him.’Georgie says she would like the Reeve family to be involved in Henry’s life. For now, the only member of the Reeve family to have met the baby is his uncle William.‘He’s a really sweet chap and I worry about his future because this is absolutely no way to begin life,’ William told the Mail. ‘Everyone needs to focus on putting this behind them.’William’s support for Georgie may have been influenced by a furious row within the Reeve family itself about the future of its estate. Leadenham has been passed down through generations since the 18th century, but was partitioned after Mrs Reeve orced Peter in 2011.If his uncle is successful, the future for baby Henry may yet prove to be rosy.Georgie insists: ‘I never expected — or wanted — James to marry me.’ She adds: ‘I just want him to do the right thing by Henry. What’s happened has happened, and I’m sure James would be amazing at fatherhood if he just gave it a chance.’Mrs Reeve and James both refused to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans Grenfell charity cookbook raises 370 000 just two months","story":"Meghan at The Hubb Community Kitchen earlier this week, where cooks cater for families made homeless by the Grenfell fireIt is Meghan’s first solo project since joining the Royal Family.The duchess, 37, came up with the idea for a book in aid of those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy, which killed 72 people, after secretly visiting the Al Manaar Muslim cultural heritage centre.

Porn star Susie Best was paid for sex by bankers who committed a huge fraud that Mr Edmonds was a victim ofEmployee Lynden Scourfield, who was jailed for 11 years in 2017, enjoyed luxury holidays, trips on banker accomplice David Mills\u0027 superyacht and sex with porn stars including escort Suzie Best.Noel is pursuing Lloyds for losses allegedly suffered when his former business Unique Group was destroyed because of the fraud.Jonathan Coad, solicitor for Mr Edmonds, on Thursday served Lloyds with a pre-case letter, needed to initiate formal proceedings which could begin as soon as December.Mr Edmonds has suggested that Mr Horta Osorio knew about the misdeeds of staff at HBOS, and on Wednesday claimed that the bank boss \u0027wants to destroy me, he wants to crush me\u0027.He also said that other Lloyds board members are at risk of police action over the case.\u0027There are members of the board who are really worried about what is really going on and there are senior executives who don\u0027t want to have their collars felt.

If he does file his claim, it will be contested.\u0027Mr Coad, of Keystone Law, said: \u0027I have never been involved in a case where so much meticulous effort has been invested by so many to professionals to prepare a claim.\u0027In this case we have had first to unpick a sophisticated fraud, and then piece it together using primarily documentary evidence, but also some key evidence from witnesses to what was going on at the time.\u0027          Mr Edmonds admits his motivation to go into the Jungle is to hit Lloyds and he insists he\u0027ll win          Mark Dobson, 56, helped to ert funds from two high-risk clients to Mills\u0027 bogus businesses in return for £30,000 and lavish hospitality.He had to chase the fraudster repeatedly before receiving a suspicious bundle of documents that contained \u0027no evidence of appropriate sanctioning\u0027 in January 2007.A month later HBOS carried out a review of 38 struggling businesses that had received irregular loans from IA and together owed the bank £375million.The conclusion was damning: the bank stood to lose up to £288million from companies that had engaged QCS under Scourfield\u0027s supervision.Mr Angus confronted the conman with the findings at the bank\u0027s Bishopsgate office on 8 March 2007 - but within hours he went off sick with \u0027work-related stress\u0027 and never returned.HBOS suspended Scourfield for gross misconduct and he resigned in April 2007.The former banking giant carried out two further investigations but neither one uncovered the \u0027true nature\u0027 of Scourfield\u0027s corrupt relationship with Mills.Prosecutor Brian O\u0027Neill QC said: \u0027Some other employees of the Bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield\u0027s immediate line manager.\u0027There is little doubt that his apparent lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield\u0027s ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.\u0027He continued: \u0027Had Burnett and others paid closer attention to the crib sheet figures, Scourfield\u0027s activities may have been identified sooner..\u0027Burnett lost his position at the Bank as a result of his failures as a manager.\u0027Jurors were told \u0027systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield\u0027s ability to behave dishonestly\u0027 as he began \u0027exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist\u0027.But Mr O\u0027Neill insisted there is \u0027no evidence\u0027 Mr Burnett or any other HBOS employees were complicit in the conspiracy, and said the bank wasn\u0027t \u0027knowingly turning a blind eye\u0027 to the con.THE FINANCIAL CRASHHBOS, once the UK\u0027s biggest mortgage lender, suffered a devastating collapse during the credit crunch - and taxpayers were left to foot the £20.5billion bill.The banking giant was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax and The Bank of Scotland and loaned £435billion within seven years as it pursued an aggressive expansion plan.But it lost £10.8billion in 2008 as profits plunged by 70 per cent when the credit crunch hit.Gordon Brown\u0027s Labour government quickly issued a £20.5billion bailout package to fix HBOS\u0027s massive funding gap and avoid a \u0027banking meltdown\u0027.The Banking Standards Commission later slammed HBOS bosses for \u0027catastrophic failings\u0027 and a \u0027colossal failure of management\u0027.Former CEO James Crosby, the \u0027architect\u0027 of HBOS\u0027s failed strategy, forfeited the knighthood he was granted for \u0027services to the finance industry\u0027 after leaving the bank for a senior FSA role in 2006.Mr Crosby, thought to draw more than £400,000 a year from his HBOS pension, said he was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for the disaster.In 2012 HBOS senior executive Peter Cummings was fined £500,000 and banned from banking for life by the FSA for his part in the bank\u0027s near-collapse.Mr Cummings retired in 2009 with a £352,000 a year pension after making his name by lending to high-profile clients including Top Shop founder Philip Green.Lloyds Bank acquired HBOS in January 2009 as part of the rescue package.Amid the chaos, Lloyds instructed Deloitte to investigate Scourfield\u0027s activity after the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority) issued a requirement notice.The criminal investigation didn\u0027t begin until after the report, dubbed Project Windsor, was completed in 2010.THE VICTIMSThe 2010 report revealed that of the £250million written off by HBOS\u0027s IA ision, £245million related to customers under Scourfield\u0027s management.Nearly all of them had engaged QCS\u0027s \u0027consultancy services\u0027.Businesses that fell prey to the criminal plot include golf equipment firm Seoul Nassau, fishing tackle company Sharpe\u0027s Holdings, aviation group Corporate Jet Services (who owned Club 328 and Euromanx), textile business Magenta, restaurant and nightclub operator the Mezzanine Group, and Remnant Media, a company setup to buy porn mags including Asian Babes.HBOS began legal action against some of the clients, including couple Paul and Nikki Turner, who ran Cambridge-based music publisher Zenith before it was destroyed by Scourfield\u0027s scam.The bank took the Turners to court more than 15 times in an unsuccessful attempt to evict them after Scourfield devastated their business.Oxfordshire farmer Justin Riggs, 57, said his livelihood was \u0027annihilated\u0027 when Scourfield authorised a £375,000 loan and advised him to sell land and chicken coops in 2004.The farmer was forced to remortgage his house when his loan rose by £7,000 after he had paid £231,000 in interest and fees.Mr Riggs\u0027 plight was discussed in parliament in 2009 as MP Ed Vaizey noted: \u0027There is a pattern in the way that Mr Scourfield engaged numerous people.\u0027He has taken businesses and loaded them with loans, charges and consultancy fees. It\u0027s now up to HBOS to come to the table.\u0027THE INVESTIGATIONThe six-year investigation, dubbed Operation Hornet, was \u0027the most complex and far-reaching\u0027 fraud case in Thames Valley Police\u0027s history, involving 120 officers.

Amazon said the safety record at its warehouses is above the industry average. Protests were also reported or due in France and Germany.While Black Friday discounts have traditionally been a U.S. retail event, companies have increasingly been offering discounts in other countries, too.          Members and supporters of the GMB union protest outside the Amazon offices  in Milton Keynes                                                    Some 42 per cent of Britons are looking forward to the event, and 22 per cent are specifically looking to buy Christmas presents - while 25 per cent are intending to shop on Cyber Monday, a survey by KPMG suggests.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u0027Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and we\u0027ve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important \u0027golden quarter\u0027. \u0027Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it.\u0027However, consumer group Which? said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in 10 Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year.It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u0027While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it\u0027s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear.\u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027          People queue up outside Foot Locker before opening during the Black Friday sales in Oxford Street, London this morning            Early-morning risers queue outside Foot Locker in Birmingham\u0027s main shopping centre, the Bullring, which is set for an incredibly busy day          Shoppers are taking advantage of the annual Black Friday sales early this morning, with this couple pictured walking out of the Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester          Thousands braved the near-freezing conditions overnight to queue outside stores up and down the country, including Tesco in Newcastle, to beat other shoppers to the biggest discounts          A shopper heads back home after a particularly early start this morning to pick up a new television from Tesco Extra in Gorton, Manchester          Stacked televisions are pictured ahead of doors opening at a Tesco in Newcastle.

Twitter users snipe and despair at Black Friday madness as bargain hunters battle for deals online and in stores across UKSocial media is awash with memes, outrage and excitement today as Black Friday frenzy sweeps the UK.Shoppers up and down the country have been sent into a frenzy as they sharpen their elbows and scramble to snap up bargains.And they are taking to Twitter to flaunt their bargains and joke about their suffering bank balances amid millions being spend on the High Street and online.More than two fifths of Britons are planning to spend in the Black Friday sales today amid warnings not to \u0027get carried away by the hype\u0027.Some 42 per cent of Britons are looking forward to the event, and 22 per cent are specifically looking to buy Christmas presents - while 25 per cent are intending to shop on Cyber Monday, a survey by KPMG suggests.  Black Friday fever has swept the nation this morning, as bargain hunters sharpen their elbows to snap up discounted goods   Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u0027Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and we\u0027ve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important \u0027golden quarter\u0027.\u0027Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it.\u0027However, consumer group Which? said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in 10 Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year.It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u0027While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it\u0027s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear.\u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027  Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4 billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6 billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027  Black Friday: Amazon reports \u0027record levels\u0027 of UK shopping"},{"url":null,"title":"Raab says Mays Brexit deal WORSE staying EU","story":"Share this article Some 88 Tory MPs have now publicly confirmed they will oppose the Brexit deal in a so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 next month.Once the \u0027payroll\u0027 of ministers is taken into account, that is over half the party\u0027s numbers in the Commons.With the DUP, Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems also opposed, the prospects for the PM look bleak.Downing Street is pinning hopes for success on MPs looking at the alternatives of chaos of Brexit being cancelled altogether, and swinging behind Mrs May at the last moment. However, attention at Westminster has been turning to what happens if she lose the vote - with speculation Mrs May could try again in the New Year. Allies fear that unless the result is relatively tight she could be so badly damaged she will have to quit.

History professor and researcher Dr. Gary Mormino described the tunnels to DailyMail.com as, \u0027nothing too remarkable to look at,\u0027 flat on the bottom, and wide, making them unsuitable as a sewage system, and all the more interesting to those wondering why they exist\u0027At this point, I\u0027m looking at ruling things out,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m asking myself, What were the tunnels not used for?\u0027While some are quick to guess they may have been used to transport bootlegged alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s, Mormino said that doesn\u0027t make any sense, either.\u0027I interviewed a lot of people in the 1970s and \u002780s who would have been involved in bootlegging of \u002720s and \u002730s and they\u0027ve all said the only people who feared the police were those who weren\u0027t involved in the rackets\u0027 he said. \u0027If you paid off the police, you were fine.\u0027     University of Southern Florida - St. Petersburg professor Emeritus of history Dr. Gary Mormino told DailyMail.com the tunnels (pictured) were likely part of a criminal network, and that Ybor City officials would have had to be in on the constructionMormino shared a story about one of his interview subjects named Sam, who said his father was an Italian bootlegger, who would receive a call once each month from the police telling him he had to come in and be arrested and pay his fines.Once there, Sam said the police would ask his father what name he wanted to be arrested under \u0027this time,\u0027 and the next day the front page of the newspaper would read, \u0027Seven Italian bootleggers arrested,\u0027 as part of a ruse intended to appease the public.In fact, Mormino said Sam also told him he used to deliver crates of bootlegged alcohol to shops and when the police were they, they would open the door and help him carry the boxes in, praising him for being such an enterprising young man. So, Mormino has determined, the tunnels probably weren\u0027t used for bootlegging. Instead, he said, it\u0027s far more likely they were used for \u0027white slavery related to bringing women across interstate lines for immoral purposes,\u0027 along with smuggling in Chinese laborers and Chinese-Cuban prostitutes.Mormino said Ybor City has had a large Chinese-Cuban population dating back to 1886.   \u0027Chinese people were brought to Cuba after slavery ended in late 19th century to replace slaves and work in the sugar industry,\u0027 Mormino said.The professor guessed that around that time, city of Tampa officials may have been in on creating the tunnels which would have otherwise been a massive and expensive undertaking for a criminal enterprise.          While some are quick to guess they may have been used to transport bootlegged alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s, Mormino said that doesn\u0027t make any sense, because police were so \u0027in on it\u0027 that tunnels wouldn\u0027t have been necessary In this undated photo federal authorities are shown unearthing a buried whiskey cache in the backyard of a Ybor City homeMormino believes that local leaders may have extending the passages down to the port\u0027Basically, corrupt politics likely allowed the criminal elements to use those tunnels as part of a vast, interconnected network,\u0027 he said.  Man accused of killing his friend on Thanksgiving Day tells...AWOL California National Guardsman \u0027tried to smuggle three...Share this articleBut, Mormino made sure to mention, that while it\u0027s fun to guess about what may have gone on in those hidden passageways all those years ago, anything anyone has come up with is just a guess. \u0027I don\u0027t know if we\u0027ll ever know the truth, to be honest,\u0027 Mormino said. \u0027It\u0027s a rather elusive story now.

I dismissed it at the time, but she kept shouting: ‘Look, Mummy, sheep, sheep!’ A few weeks later, we walked past again and she announced with a sad face: ‘Sheep gone now, Mummy.’Although aware our house is built on the site of old sheep farming cottages, I put it to the back of my mind.

No wonder I have started to feel unsettled in our home of three years. Although I don’t believe in ghosts, I would be lying if I said the idea of them didn’t scare me. There is so much in life we don’t understand, so much we don’t know, and there are so many accounts of people saying they’ve seen things they cannot rationally explain.I decided to do some digging, in an effort to convince myself that there is nothing to Rosalyn’s imaginings.I wish I hadn’t.Census records for 1861 show there was a ten-year-old boy called Alexander Turner living here.

Records are patchy from this time, so it’s very likely that Matilda was living here when she was much younger.Although I am struggling to convince myself that Alex, Tilly and the visiting flock of sheep are nothing more than the creation of a toddler’s vivid imagination, a recent study reveals that one in five Britons claims to have experienced the presence of a ghost.I did some research and discovered that there are many rational parents in the same position as me — with children like the little boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, in the film The Sixth Sense — who say they ‘see dead people’.Take mother-of-six Katie Jones, 33, a carer from Canterbury, Kent. She has an 11-year-old daughter Alice, who, from the age of two, has spoken of seeing people who are no longer here. Katie, who is married to landlord Gareth, 47, explains: ‘When Alice was two, she started to cry a lot, saying there were two men in her room staring and shouting at her, and she didn’t like it.‘She then started to say that a girl called Sheila sat at the bottom of her bed crying for her mummy. I looked in old newspaper cuttings and found that there was a girl of that name murdered here. It chilled me to the core.‘Alice then told me that my grandmother, also named Alice, who died a year before my daughter was born, was coming into her bedroom. She said that Nanna had told the girl and the men to go away, and they had.’Katie says Alice would accurately describe the clothes her grandmother wore, something she couldn’t have known.‘When Alice was three, a family member had a stillborn baby. Alice told me that Nanna had been to see her with a baby in her arms. She said the baby was named Max. There is no way she could’ve known this. We hadn’t told her about the baby or his name — she was too little to understand.‘As the years have passed, she still says Max and Nanna are there. She even told me it was Max’s fourth birthday and, when I checked, she was right. She had the correct day and age.’Katie continues: ‘When she was four, I remember her telling me that she had to give our next-door neighbour a message. Her husband had just died of cancer and she wanted to tell her to stop crying as he had told her he was fine.‘When she first started saying things, I brushed it off as the chatter of a little girl, but the more it happened the more I came to realise she was telling the truth. Now I have no doubt she has a gift.‘She has always felt comforted by her Nanna, but there have been some bad experiences. In our old house, she kept saying she saw a boy and she’d refuse to go upstairs. She’d stand there screaming, saying the boy wouldn’t let her go past. It used to really scare me.’Now aged 11, Alice says that she’s seeing things less and less, but can clearly remember seeing her great-grandmother. ‘I always felt safe with my Nanna there, and I remember seeing the baby, too. I also remember it being his birthday.‘I only feel scared when it’s someone I don’t know, but I see them less now. To any other children who see things like this, I would say you don’t have to be scared, as they are just looking out for you and trying to protect you.’          Tricia Jordan pictured with her son Luca, sevenDr Stephen Westgarth, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a consultant child psychiatrist and medical director of Child Psychiatry UK, says such behaviour is normal for a young child.‘Children’s imaginative worlds are limitless, and don’t contain the same social and physical rules of the adult world.‘As a parent, I wouldn’t be worried about a child experiencing these episodes and, in some ways, it can be viewed as very positive, because it shows that they have a vivid and well-defined imagination.‘The normal situation would be that, as the child grows and the brain develops, they begin to rationalise what they are experiencing and so the episodes will begin to wane.’He says he has dealt with families who say their children are talking to ‘the beyond’, but says these tended to be spiritualists and strong believers in the afterlife, so there was a culture there already.Yet, like me, mother-of-two Tricia Jordan is not clairvoyant, but she is in no doubt that her son talks to the dead.The 32-year-old medical secretary says her seven-year-old son, Luca, has been ‘seeing’ her dead grandmother since he was a baby, which used to scare her, but she now feels comforted by it.Tricia, from Newport, Gwent, who is married to postman Stuart, 37, and also has a four-year-old son, Bobby, says: ‘My grandmother passed away when Luca was 18 months old. He had just started to speak, and the first thing he told me was how Granny would tuck him up in bed. I found it really strange. It used to scare me, and I’d change the subject.‘One of the eeriest things was him singing The Big Ship Sails On The Ally-Ally-O, which she always sang to me. He would sing it over and over, and tell me how Granny was there. I had never sung it to him. There is no way he could have known this song.‘As time went on, I realised he wasn’t scared so it was all right.’She describes another encounter when he was four: ‘One day, we passed a house near our home. He told me it was Martin’s house but he wasn’t there because he died in a fire. I checked the names on a census and a Martin had lived there. This really scared me.’Luca hasn’t had any spooky sightings for some years, and today he has no memory of seeing his dead grandmother.Tricia says that, while she has always believed in an afterlife, what she has experienced with her son has left her utterly convinced that the dead walk among us.She says: ‘I have always believed a little bit, but what I have seen with Luca blew my mind. It made me believe completely.’          Six-year-old Riley has talked to people his mother Hollie could not seeHollie Smith from New Addington, South London, also shares this conviction. She is certain her six-year-old son, Riley, has seen ghosts. The 32-year-old, who runs a party business with husband Colin, 40, says he has experienced too many things to leave her in any doubt as to their validity.She says: ‘When he was two, we were out walking when he started pointing and waving, saying, “Look, Mummy, there’s a soldier, he’s waving at us.” There was no one there. He was so excited and animated. He then looked so disappointed when he told me the soldier had gone. I believed him. He was too little to make something like that up.‘Surprisingly, I didn’t feel scared. I almost felt like it was a precious experience that someone from another life wanted to say hello.’Hollie also recalls another instance when Riley was around 18 months old. ‘I walked into his bedroom and he was having a conversation with someone. His language was limited, but he was talking and answering and gesturing with someone who wasn’t there.‘I asked him who it was. He said it was Humpty. He kept on telling me for days afterwards that Humpty was there. At the time, our neighbour had just died, a man who was very overweight. I had never sung this nursery rhyme to Riley. Maybe he’d picked it up elsewhere, but I think he was talking to our neighbour.’Riley also had an imaginary friend at pre-school called George, who was so real to him that he was the only child he played with. She adds: ‘Yes, it could be nothing more than an imaginary friend, but in the context of these other things, I’m not so sure.Celebrity psychic Honor Broxap believes such sightings should not be dismissed. ‘We are all born with a sixth sense,’ she says. ‘Yet we stop using it as we get older. Children are much more believing, less questioning or cynical. They have not yet been conditioned to think that it’s all just nonsense.          Alice, 11, said she has seen a number of ghosts from the age of three‘You have to be careful that you don’t over-exaggerate it. Yes, children do have a vivid imagination, but more often than not, there is some truth in it.’Clairvoyant medium and psychic artist Jackie Dennison agrees: ‘Children have imaginary friends. Maybe, it is just that, but perhaps it is sometimes more. They are very open to spirits and are unfazed by them. They take things in their stride. I believe we can also see layers of time, memories and echoes of what was once there.’Jackie says that this might explain the sheep in my cellar, and, with regards to Tilly and Alex, she tells me not to worry about them: ‘I think the fact that they’re in your home is quite amazing. They are obviously happy that you’re living there as a family.’Although I don’t share this sense of wonderment, I’m starting to feel a touch more at ease as to whatever is going on in my home. Rosalyn is happy, and also very young. I’m sure, like Luca and Riley, these stories will start to tail off as her real world expands, and she won’t remember much of what she tells me now.Yet, although I’ve tried to dismiss it and laugh it off, there is a growing part of me that is no longer fully convinced that we’re entirely alone in our home."},{"url":null,"title":"Teachers given wellbeing days Christmas shopping","story":"Boy, 13, who has cancer is forced to sit alone in class...Cleaning lady is jailed for ten years in Greece for claiming...Share this article‘This is a way for me to say thank you to staff for going above and beyond what is asked of them day in, day out, such as spending a weekend away on a residential trip or staying at school to help run a movie night for the children to enjoy.’ He personally covers the teachers on their days off, with other non-teaching roles also covered internally within the school.‘As a result, no teaching time is lost for any child and there is no disruption to the day-to-day running of the school,’ Mr Hulme said. The move has drawn support online from dozens of teachers, many of whom say other schools have adopted the policy.Primary school teacher Stephanie Brown said: ‘What a wonderful gesture. I know of a few schools who do this and the staff are so thankful for this day.’While another teacher Sarah Wilson said: ‘We get a half day – it’s much appreciated. For all teachers and teaching assistants.’Teacher Naomi Takeda said: ‘We have a wellbeing week in December which culminates in a day off on the Friday for all staff and students to reconnect with family and friends.’ A teacher at Langshott Primary School in Horley, Surrey, also said they get a half day for Christmas shopping – but later deleted the comment.However, Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, believes the initiative is an ‘indulgence that schools cannot afford to do’.The measure was ‘another example of staff setting a poor example’ at a time when ‘we’re fining parents who take their children out during term time on holiday,’ the former head said.More than 9,000 parents in Kent have been fined for taking their children out of school during term over the last four years – one of the highest rates in the country.Mr McGovern added: ‘It sets a terrible example to people and I’m afraid it means that teachers are going to be “de-professionalised” and no one is going to take them seriously if this is what they’re doing. They should be putting the education of children first.‘If teachers want to be respected, they need to set an example by turning up for the job and doing it well.

Miss David claims his father wanted her to have an abortion          Georgina says her ex-lover is refusing to contribute towards the upkeep of their eight-month-old son, Henry          Georgie, 34, a legal aide from London, began dating James, 37, who owns a polo club on his family’s Lincolnshire estateDespite being owner of Leadenham Polo Club and a schoolboy contemporary of Prince William, Reeve has been assessed as unable to pay child maintenance because of the ‘modest’ income he receives from his family.In a letter from a solicitor acting on his behalf, the Edinburgh University graduate, whose ancestor fought alongside the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill.Georgie denies both claims, but the row has even caught the eye of senior Church of England clergy after it emerged that James’s mother, Henrietta, who also wants no contact with her grandson, was appointed a lay canon at Lincoln Cathedral just a month before Henry’s birth.Divorcee Mrs Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion.In a written response to that claim, the Bishop of Grantham said that while ‘Miss David came under great pressure’, there was no evidence that Mrs Reeve, who is also Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, was involved.A morally muddled saga then, and one which raises questions about sex, relationships and responsibility in this modern age of dating.Who, then, should be blamed for this sorry situation? And, above all, what does the future hold for the golden-haired, blue-eyed baby boy at the heart of it?Henry James Frederick David-Reeve, who shares both his parents’ surnames is, somewhat ironically, the spitting image of the handsome father he has never met.          James Reeve accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill          Divorcee Henrietta Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion‘It’s for Henry’s sake that I’m speaking out about this,’ says Georgie, cradling her son.‘He wasn’t planned, but the fact is that we have a beautiful baby boy and he deserves to have the best chance in life. I am struggling to cope financially, and I just want James to accept some responsibility for his son.’James Reeve sees things rather differently. A letter sent to Georgie by his solicitor says: ‘You entered a relationship with him which was meant to be entirely casual, with no commitment at all.’Meanwhile, Georgie has been receiving emotional support from a most unlikely quarter — James’s elder brother, William, who is heir to the family estate. He has not only been to visit his nephew but also became his godfather when Henry was christened in September.He hit the news himself this week after he collapsed in court as he launched a battle with his mother over the future of their family’s 230-year-old country estate.Old Etonian William, 38, says the future of the 18th-century Leadenham estate is at risk due to a bitter family row, not helped by the situation between James and Georgie.Meanwhile, Georgie remains hurt and angry at the way she has been treated. While she doesn’t deny the relationship was casual at first, she argues that she and James began to see each other regularly — at least every week — and their romance became more than just physical.‘We used to take my dog for walks together and go out for long lunches and dinners. Or I cooked for us here. Sometimes we used to get a takeaway and a bottle of wine and just lie in front of the television. He brought flowers. We became close. It started to feel more serious. We opened up to each other about our lives.’And what different lives they are.Georgie, the daughter of a Pakistani-born father and British mother, was raised in a terrace house in South-east London and attended an all-girls’ state school. She studied media at the University of Buckingham, but left before finishing her degree and worked as a VIP nightclub hostess at Chinawhite in Soho.In her early 20s, she began work as a secretary at a barristers’ chambers in central London, moved to Chelsea and joined a ladies’ shooting club in West London.James, meanwhile, is one of four children born to Peter and Henrietta Reeve, and grew up enjoying all the privileges that life in a family with a lineage stretching back to Edward III can offer — including 20-bedroom Grade II-listed Leadenham House on the family’s 3,000-acre estate. He attended Eton and after university, returned to the estate to pursue his love of polo.

The only person who can possibly know if I took it is me, and I know I took it.’Nevertheless, in June 2017 a home test revealed she was pregnant. At first, she says, James took the news calmly. He travelled from Lincolnshire and the pair attended an NHS clinic in North London offering pregnancy counselling and abortion services.She admits that at this stage, she was ready to consider a termination. ‘I was only five weeks pregnant and it seemed the sensible thing to do,’ she explains. But before they had the chance to discuss it, medical events swiftly overtook them.This dramatically impacted her feelings about the pregnancy.First, a scan suggested Georgie was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy — a potentially fatal condition. She was sent to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, where she was monitored until it became clear the pregnancy was not ectopic and she was suffering from a harmless cyst in her fallopian tube.‘It was a very stressful situation because it could have impacted my future fertility,’ she says. ‘James was wonderful, perfect in every way. He cuddled me and reassured me.’When she was discharged three days later, she returned home to find he had cleaned her flat and put fresh flowers in a vase.Soon after, they returned to the pregnancy advice clinic, again planning to speak to a counsellor about the possibility of a termination, but after another scan, Georgie was told she had suffered a ‘missed miscarriage’ — where an embryo dies but is not immediately expelled by the body. Medical advice for women suffering the condition in the first three months of pregnancy is to allow nature to take its course.Given that both she and James believed the pregnancy was over, she says, there was no longer any need to discuss a termination. Instead, they went away for a weekend to help her get over the ordeal, staying at the Victoria Inn hotel in Holkham, Norfolk.‘He was really lovely to me at that time,’ she says.But at a check-up at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in August 2017, Georgie was given the jaw-dropping news that she hadn’t miscarried at all. She was 13 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby.‘It was the last thing I expected,’ she says. ‘I could see a heartbeat. I was overwhelmed that after everything that had happened, here was a perfect little baby.’She phoned James to break the news. ‘He was completely shocked,’ she says. ‘I asked if he wanted to see the scan photos and he said that he didn’t, that it was too much for him to take in. He said he needed to speak to his mother.‘I understood that he was overwhelmed.’She claims she then had a call from Mrs Reeve. ‘During the conversation, she said James wouldn’t stand by me. She said that I should be aware that he wouldn’t be inheriting anything. There was no reasoning with her. She upset me so much that I hung up.’After that, she says, she and James maintained contact by phone but relations between them were ‘not the same as before. He wanted me to have an abortion but after everything that had happened and then seeing the scan, I felt very differently. I felt very pressurised by him and his family’The last time she saw James was at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Georgie says it became clear he still expected her to terminate the pregnancy.‘He kept coming in and out of the room on his phone and then he just disappeared and didn’t come back. That was the last time I saw him. It was such a brutal way to be left.’When Georgie wrote to James, telling him she had to ‘decide what’s best for our baby’, she received an email from his solicitor telling her: ‘He does not wish to have any contact with you now or in the future. However, he remains willing to support you financially with the previous plan to have a termination. Any financial payment would need to be through me.’Further strongly worded legal letters followed. One sent in October 2017 reads: ‘Frankly, our client feels that he was entrapped by you . . . Our client has only ever wanted to have children in the context of a loving, stable and long-term relationship and clearly that was not the nature of the relationship he had with you. Our client has no intention of having any involvement with your child.’    James Reeve has claimed he is a victim of \u0027entrapment\u0027 who is not paid enough to make child maintenance payments Extraordinarily, a solicitor’s letter was even sent to Georgie’s widowed mother stating: ‘Reports through third parties have led our client to be concerned for Georgie’s mental state.’It continued: ‘He felt that it was necessary to put on record his own position so that you know how best to help her.’ Henry was born on March 5, 2018 and Georgie texted James to say he was welcome to visit at the hospital, but she received no response. Requests to meet via a legal mediation service were also rejected.After she turned to the Government’s Child Maintenance Service, James complied with instructions to pay her £407.71. According to his solicitor, a further review by the CMS showed ‘he lacked a current salary and was only in receipt of a modest income from his family’. The CMS does not consider assets, but the Department for Work and Pensions, which oversees the service, is monitoring the case.And it is clear that Georgie is not going to go away quietly. When the Rector of St Luke’s wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln in August, he asked for an investigation into the ‘pastorally unacceptable situation which has clear safeguarding implications’.Writing back a month later, the Bishop of Grantham said an investigation had concluded ‘this is not a safeguarding matter’.

For now, the only member of the Reeve family to have met the baby is his uncle William.‘He’s a really sweet chap and I worry about his future because this is absolutely no way to begin life,’ William told the Mail. ‘Everyone needs to focus on putting this behind them.’William’s support for Georgie may have been influenced by a furious row within the Reeve family itself about the future of its estate. Leadenham has been passed down through generations since the 18th century, but was partitioned after Mrs Reeve orced Peter in 2011.If his uncle is successful, the future for baby Henry may yet prove to be rosy.Georgie insists: ‘I never expected — or wanted — James to marry me.’ She adds: ‘I just want him to do the right thing by Henry. What’s happened has happened, and I’m sure James would be amazing at fatherhood if he just gave it a chance.’Mrs Reeve and James both refused to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"How Theresa pull Houdini survive weeks writes PETER OBORNE","story":"    Theresa May seems to have fought off a rebellion from backbench Tory MPs          Theresa May gives a statement outside Downing Street following news a deal with the EU had been reachedGetting it through the House of Commons, however, will be a very different matter.The vote is scheduled to take place in less than three weeks’ time. Gulp!At least 80 Tory MPs are openly hostile and could vote against the deal. So too could Ulster’s Democratic Unionist Party MPs, who are supposedly in alliance with the Government to provide the Tories with a Commons majority.In other words, the arithmetic looks dire. It seems almost certain that MPs will snub Mrs May, and her Brexit package will crash and burn.What happens then?Anyone who thinks they know is a fool. However, it is possible to set out some of the possible scenarios.First, assuming that Mrs May loses the vote, she could risk all by resigning her government.Banksy paintings worth £13million seized by Belgian police...Black Friday bargain hunters FIGHT for the best deals on the...Share this articleThis would mean the Queen would ask Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the Opposition, to try to form a government himself. If he failed to command a Commons majority — the most likely outcome — a General Election would have to be held.True, Mrs May has rejected the idea of a third General Election in as many years — undoubtedly a wise move after her miscal-culation of going to country in June last year.Alternatively, Mrs May could simply resign as Tory leader — and hang on forlornly as a lame duck Prime Minister while her party elects a replacement.Contemptuously, hardline Brexiteers claim it doesn’t matter either way whether Mrs May stays or goes. They say that if she loses next month’s Commons vote, then Britain would automatically leave the EU regardless, and without a deal, on March 29 next year.          The Prime Minister is not out of jail yet as she still needs to get the deal through parliamentRemainer MPs disagree. Optimistically, they believe that MPs from all the main parties will come together to prevent a no-deal exit from the EU.Under this scenario, it would mean Downing Street — whether Mrs May is Prime Minister or not — losing control of events.A swaggeringly self-confident Parliament would take over decision-making.It is important to note that more than 70 per cent of MPs are believed to have voted Remain in the EU referendum and that, crucially, the Commons has a fervently pro-EU Speaker in the shape of John Bercow.          Jacob Rees-Mogg has made his thoughts on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan clear after he handed in a letter of no confidence in the Prime MinisterMake no mistake: Bercow will try to manipulate events in a pro-European direction.Meanwhile, as Westminster descended into chaos, it would be only a matter of time before political uncertainly translated into financial and economic chaos.There would be a huge risk of a recession with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.It should not be forgotten that while MPs are playing their political games, the livelihoods of the British people are at risk.This sobering thought leads me to believe that Mrs May’s position is much stronger than it looks.Most decent folk think she is doing her best in desperately difficult circumstances. They feel disgust at what they see — rightly or wrongly — as cynical manoeuvring by devious and calculating politicians only interested in furthering their own Westminster careers.That is why Mrs May was surely right this week to appeal over the heads of Parliament to the British people in a series of TV appearances and radio interviews.Thus far, this strategy is working, with polls showing that the PM is much more popular than any rivals for her job.The fact is that Houdini May has survived numerous desperate scrapes.Repeatedly, her enemies and even some colleagues have plotted to destroy her. Ill-informed commentators have forecast her downfall. Yet each time she’s survived.Up until now, I have been one of the few to predict her survival. But now, I can’t confidently forecast that Mrs May and her deal will make it through the next few tempestuous weeks.But, as a betting man, I do still believe she’s favourite to make it.Of course, her EU exit deal isn’t perfect. But it’s the best available. No one has yet come up with a better idea — at any rate not one which would work.Meanwhile, her allies are making it clear to hardcore Brexiteers, on one side, that the alternative to her strategy is Britain remaining in the EU.On the other hand, to Europhiles, they claim the alternative is a no-deal Brexit and all the perils that would entail.This is a clever two-pronged weapon and so far it’s worked.What’s more, Mrs May has successfully employed a tactic of which, quite frankly, I had not considered her capable.She’s split the Brexiteers.There have been Cabinet resignations — by Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey — but their erstwhile Brexiteer colleagues including Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove and Penny Mordaunt have stayed onboard.          Boris Johnson is one of the most high profile Cabinet ministers to have resigned over BrexitThe repercussions of what happens over the coming weeks are much more significant for Britain than those after the Suez Crisis of 1956, when prime minister Anthony Eden resigned. They are much, much more crucial.At heart, the Suez Crisis was about Britain coming to terms with the loss of empire.Brexit is about how we survive as an independent nation in a hostile world outside a powerful bloc of European countries.The poet Hilaire Belloc warned a century ago in his Cautionary Verses For Children: ‘Always keep a-hold of nurse — For fear of finding something worse!’As Theresa May leads us out of the EU, his advice is more vital than ever.  Tory blunder on our precious voting systemThe Electoral Commission is an independent body whose duty it is to ‘oversee elections and regulate political finance’.In view of this responsibility, it worries me that Tory peer Lord Gilbert has been appointed a board member.In the past, I have highlighted Stephen Gilbert’s controversial role as a Tory party campaign chief at a time when disturbing evidence came to light that the Tories had disregarded electoral law by overspending, during a series of by-elections in 2014 when they feared losing to Ukip. Following a brilliant investigation by Channel 4’s Michael Crick, there were even fears that officials compounded the offence by submitting at the very least misleading election returns to returning officers — a criminal offence punishable by jail.I repeatedly tried to approach Lord Gilbert for an explanation of apparent discrepancies in Tory spending. He never came back to me. Eventually, there were no criminal charges and I am sure Lord Gilbert’s actions were totally above board.Earlier this year, the Commission itself was heavily criticised after some senior members voiced opposition to Brexit.There was concern that commissioners had infringed the body’s code of conduct, which requires them to act ‘at all times’ to ‘uphold its impartiality’.With this latest development, putting Lord Gilbert forward to work at the Commission, the Tory Party has sent out a most unfortunate message about its respect for a deeply sensitive role which goes right to the heart of the integrity of the British political process.  One minister keeps gallantly riding to the support of Mrs May.Prisons minister Rory Stewart has been ever-present in TV studios, explaining with characteristic courtesy the benefits of the PM’s deal with Brussels.Mr Stewart is the opposite of those identikit politicians with scant knowledge of life outside Westminster.

It was this which gave her the inspiration for the book.          Meghan, whose first baby with Prince Harry is due in the spring, holds her bump today as she talks to the chefsShe talked to a number of projects but is understood to have developed a particular bond with the women as she felt she could do something tangible to help.Meghan ‘got stuck in straight away’, working at the community kitchen and helping create the book, which is supported by The Royal Foundation and published by Penguin Random House.Of her first visit, she said: ‘An apron was quickly wrapped around me, I pushed up my sleeves, and I found myself washing the rice for lunch.’ In the foreword to the book, she wrote: ‘I immediately felt connected to this community kitchen it is a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together.’Sales of the cookbook, which reached number one on the Amazon chart within hours of its publication, have been so impressive that they have dwarfed television chef Gino D’Acampo’s latest publication, Gino’s Italian Adriatic Escape, which has shifted 6,235 copies since its release in October.The money from the community cookbook has helped transform the facility, which is based in north Kensington, with a redesigned and refitted kitchen. It now opens seven days a week instead of only two as previously.Meghan, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry, has continued to visit the kitchen and earlier this week helped the women prepare fresh meals.Pictures showed her chatting and laughing with the women, who now cook 200 meals a day to deliver to places such as homeless shelters and women’s refuges.They are also planning outreach projects from the kitchen.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/00/50391D5000000578-0-image-a-43_1537053632660.jpg","title":"Prolific novelist tells story Jesus Christ birth crucifixion just 346 words","story":"    Novelist Jeffrey Archer, pictured at a charity ball last week, donated his story of the life of Jesus to Cancer Research UK.

I was delighted when Cancer Research UK chose the text for one of their Christmas cards, not least because my wife was successfully treated for bladder cancer some years ago, while I have fully recovered from prostate cancer.‘Cancer affects the lives of so many, as Mary and I are so aware, and is particularly poignant at this time of year, which is all about spending valuable time with your family.’          The £3.99 card, with a gold and white nativity scene on its cover, is exclusively available now in Cancer Research UK’s 600 shops nationwideArcher has written 35 books, including works of non-fiction such as the three volumes of prison diaries following his 2001 conviction for perjury and perverting the course of justice, and they have sold 275million copies.He has shown an enthusiasm for biblical themes before, titling one of his novels Kane And Abel in an echo of the sons of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, from the book of Genesis.

Instead of pursuing visions of perfection, we value what works.Extracting ourselves from the European Union while maintaining our friendship with its members amounts to one of the most complicated tasks imaginable.I believe that the Declaration on our future relationship with the EU, agreed by the Government and the European Commission this week, stands in the best traditions of British pragmatism and ambition.We have not got everything we wanted and nor have they: Countless hours of painstaking negotiation have inevitably produced compromises on both sides. Yet if anyone still questions the resolve of this Government or this Prime Minister to honour the result of the Brexit referendum, then the Declaration should lay those doubts to rest.In the words of paragraph 4, our new relationship with the EU after Brexit will be based on ‘respecting the result of the 2016 referendum’ and the ‘sovereignty of the United Kingdom’. The British people voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money – and this Declaration fulfils those instructions, while also striking the balance that will protect jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.The automatic right of any EU citizen to live and work in the UK will come to an end. We will be able to admit people with the skills to contribute to our economy, regardless of their national background.There is no need to worry about holidays or routine trips. The Declaration preserves visa-free travel across the EU for short-term visits. And the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and of Britons residing in the EU are fully protected. How Theresa May can pull a Houdini and survive the next few...May refuses THREE times to say whether she will quit if she...Share this articleThe Declaration will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Our laws will be made in our Parliament and interpreted by our courts. Britain will stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing us to exercise full control over public-spending priorities. This Government’s priority back home is the NHS. By 2023, we will be investing an extra £394million in the NHS every week. Having campaigned hard for this money, now we must ensure it is delivered.We have agreed to create a free-trade area with the EU without tariffs, quotas or charges, and Britain will regain the ability to seek free-trade deals around the world, a power we have not had since we joined the Common Market in 1973. The Declaration recognises how the UK will now develop an ‘independent trade policy’.          In a BBC phone in today, Mrs May warned that EU is not \u0027going to give us a better deal\u0027 if MPs vote down her settlementIt also makes clear that in foreign policy and security, we will continue to ‘combine efforts’ with the EU. But the reason why the course set by the Prime Minister is the best one for Britain does not just depend on the precise wording of the Declaration. It depends on our national duty, at this crucial moment, to keep our eyes on the main prize.Just over two years ago, 17.4million people voted to leave the EU, more than for any other cause or party in British history.If Parliament were to reject the Declaration and the proposed Withdrawal Agreement, this would open the door for those who wish to derail Brexit and overturn the result of the referendum.          The Prime Minister today mounted another staunch defence of the settlement she has thrashed out with Brussels, saying it is the \u0027right\u0027 one for the countryAlready we hear demands for the British people to be made to rerun the debate and vote again. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour just play politics – standing both for and against a second referendum, saying one thing to Leave voters and quite another to Remainers.As it happens, I voted to stay in the EU, but I respect the outcome and I believe in the democratic imperative of honouring the decision of the British people.Today, the choice is not between this Declaration and a perfect agreement. The real choice is between the terms secured by the Prime Minister in the national interest or the danger of going back to square one and Brexit not happening at all. This would deal a profoundly damaging blow to British democracy.Now that the crucial hour is upon us, the country should get behind her. "},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Fiona Bruce doesnt cunning command Question Time bear pit","story":"    BBC newsreader and Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce, who has reportedly been offered the job of hosting Question TimeAs the presenter of the Antiques Roadshow, Fiona Bruce should be able to differentiate between a priceless chalice and a poisoned one.One of the most eloquent, intelligent and gracious faces on TV, she has been offered the job of presenting Question Time, taking over from David Dimbleby who has held the chair for nearly a quarter of a century.My advice?

When I read An American Tragedy, Dreiser had so much empathy and insight that I felt as if he had peered into my soul. Finally, when I read the first line of Larry McMurtry’s All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers, it was so full of bright, shiny promise – on which it delivered – that I remember thinking, “Oh please let me make someone else feel the way I do right now.”The book that is most underrated A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith has never enjoyed the stature it deserves. Like Huckleberry Finn, it should be considered a classic. Unlike Huckleberry Finn, it concerns a girl’s life, in an impoverished section of Brooklyn in the early 20th century, so it isn’t seen as universal in its themes. It’s a raw, unvarnished book.The book that changed my mindIt’s a tie between Julia Sweeney’s Letting Go of God and Christopher Hitchens’s Hitch-22. For years, I had identified as agnostic or even deist, but those two very different books allowed me to come to terms with the fact that I am a very reluctant atheist. I hope I’m wrong, I yearn to be wrong.The book I couldn’t finishJust one? Impossible. And I hate to diss other writers. I will say there was a popular, beloved book and I hated it so much that I stopped reading on the penultimate page. Refusing to find out what happened to its horrible heroine felt like a principled protest at the time. Besides, I’m sure she got the happy ending she didn’t deserve.The book I’m ashamed not to have readUlysses by James Joyce. I’m going to keep trying, though.The book I give as a giftEmma Who Saved My Life by Wilton Barnhardt, one of the best books ever about being young, but also about New York City in the 1970s and 80s. And so very, very funny. My earliest reading memoryMy sister helping me through one of the primers used to teach reading in US schools, the Dick and Jane books. Sally, the youngest child in that very white, suburban family, sat on her tricycle and said: “Oh! Oh, oh, oh!” And that’s how I began.My comfort readMarjorie Morningstar by Herman Wouk, every year, year in and year out, although I didn’t discover it until my 20s, on the shelves of a friend who no longer speaks to me. Which, I guess, sort of makes her the Marsha to my Marjorie, although I’m sure she’d like to think it’s the other way around.• Sunburn by Laura Lippman is published by Faber.

Once on site, search for book title and you\u0027ll find the offer of signed personalised copies! I will also be signing copies of both that book and my self-help book, How to Hold a Grudge, at Hatchards, Piccadilly, on Thur 29 Nov 6-8 pm, and at Waterstones, Piccadilly on Thur 6 Dec from 7.45 pm. Agatha fans, come along and say hello! I\u0027m sure there will be mince pies! S xThanks to Sophie for joining us and thank you all for your great questions. Join us next Tuesday on the Reading group where we’ll announce our December theme!Without asking you to give away your secret recipe, how do you start crafting the plot to a Poirot? What comes first, a concept or a conflict that pops into your head? A murderer’s character? A brilliant twist? Where do you start?!? I always start with either a great opening mystery hook (as in Mystery of Three Quarters) or what I think is a great twistending (as in my first two Poirots). Then I work either backwards or forwards.In an earlier response you mentioned Christie’s intellectual curiosity and literary ambition. This is something I thought about when reading some of her books, and recalling others, in preparation for this month.How serious do you think Christie’s literary ambitions were? Have we knowledge of any manuscripts squirrelled away that were her stabs at “proper” literary fiction?I think the distinction between literary and popular fiction is a fairly arbitrary one, to be honest. Christie was very serious about wanting to extend the boundaries of the genre, and also of the kind of books she was expected to write. I think in an ideal world she would have wanted to try writing all kinds of different genres. She wrote several novels that weren\u0027t crime, under the name Mary Westmacott - they are literary novels, in a way.Hi I love your new Poirot books. Don’t you think it’s amazing that she chose a European refugee as her all knowing detective and that he makes fun of Hastings so much? Or perhaps what’s amazing is that dynamic gaining such popularity?Yes, it\u0027s amazing - and shows, I think, that she wasn\u0027t a snob or a little-Englander at all. She used Poirot\u0027s outsider status to demonstrate how the English middle and upper classes dismissed the accountexperience of anyone who wasn\u0027t exactly like them.If you could have another author take on writing one of your characters, who would you like to see take up the reins?Hmmm. That is a very interesting question. Someone new and up-and-coming whose name I don\u0027t know. Whoever could demonstrate to me that they could write about Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer AND write a self help book about how to hold a grudge!@FayFung3 on Twitter says:Is it possible that Hercule Poirot and Mrs. Marple would be friends? I think if they met they might well be friends, yes. But Agatha Christie didn\u0027t put them together in the same story, and so I don\u0027t think I should either.@kategof asks on Twitter:1 can we expect more Poirot novels? And2 what is your fave Christie novel? thank you! Yes, I\u0027m writing a fourth one for sure - and it will be published in 2020! My fave Christie novel is The Hollow, or Murder on the Orient Express - can\u0027t decide!@afcwheels asks on Twitter:Have you decided how you will end Hercule Poirot’s career? Agatha ended his career in Curtain in the 1970s! My job is to write a small middle section of his career!@Komorebi_Days asks on Twitter:I would like to ask if Sophie will be writing about Harley Quin (from The Mysterious Mr. Quin) also. It would be great to see more stories involving him. No plans to, no. Sorry! Poirot is keeping me busy enough!A question from Twitter - @smithpm81 asks:i want to know if Sophie pictures David Suchet in her mind when writing Poirot, i know i do when reading her books. (Also i cannot help picturing the actor who played Japp as her character Catchpool)When writing, I\u0027m kind of imagining Poirot from the insideas a character, and I tend not to \u0027see\u0027 him visually. I\u0027m thinking far more about what\u0027s in his mind and how he\u0027s behaving. I do however think David S is a perfect visual and aural representation of Poirot - I love him!What is it that makes you think Christie is a genius? (I guess I’m also asking: What sets her apart from other crime writers - and why has she remained so popular.)Several things, IMHO, make her an incomparable genius:1) ingenuity of her plots and how they expanded the ambitions and possibilities of the genre.2) amazing blend of opposites: her books are both v simple and v complex, v dark and v funenjoyable.3) her sheer and tangible love of storytelling above all else4) her unguessabilityunpredictability5) her wisdom and insight into human nature6) her prose - crisp, elegant, not a word too much or out of placeI’m afraid it’s a bit off topic: I love Sophie’s poetry, but she hasn’t published a collection in over 10 years. Has she given it up (can a poet ‘give up’?) or is it just dormant for now?Not quite dormant, Mark! My poetry muscles are currently busy writing lyrics for songs in musicals! Together with a good friend, Annette Armitage, I have written 2 musicals - one of them is a murder mystery musical and the other is a musical locked room mystery. One is on tour at the moment, and at the Cambridge Literary Festival this weekend! I still do write poetry and will be writing more in the near to medium future, too.Will you write a Poirot that has anything about his love life in it?I\u0027ve chosen not to. Agatha never went into detail about his love life, so I feel I should follow her example!Over the past twenty years there has been a huge upsurge in popularity for psychological thrillers. More recently, there has been a small but noticeable rise in popularity for crime novels inspired by the golden age of detective fiction. As you’ve written in both genres, which do you find most fun to write? Do you feel whisky-soaked detectives with a orce-riddled past have become a cliche? And what would your advice be to aspiring crime writers who want to break in to the “golden age” category - do they need to adopt some of the tropes of the thriller (like the wonderful Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle)? Or could a more comedicWodehousian edge be a worthwhile spin? Finally, what are your top three Christies? Mine are books that others might see as humdrum - The Moving Finger, The Sittaford Mystery and They Came to Baghdad.I don\u0027t have a favourite between the two - I love writing dark contemporary thrillers and I equally love writing my Poirot novels. Yes, anything becomes a cliche if it\u0027s done too often. I\u0027d say the secret to breaking through in any genre is to write something original, unexpected and unguessable. That\u0027s why 7 Deaths of EH did so well - totally fresh and surprising. Key thing is: great hook and great story - whether it\u0027s grimdark or upbeat-comic. People love gripping stories over and above everything else.My favourite 3 Christies? The Hollow, Murder on the Orient Express and Sleeping Murder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d5df857d3fd3d1d804757fe0420d9728ac9c6a/0_134_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f324042e6db72c84a2caeb22e8f8656e","title":"has the backlash to black friday already started","story":"Brands, activists and charities are questioning the annual consumer feeding frenzyBlack Friday may be one of the biggest shopping days on the calendar, but it has also spawned a flurry of alternatives to the consumer frenzy from brands and charities.Greenpeace has teamed up with partners including Fashion Revolution and Shareable to back Make Smthing week, during which artists and crafters lead workshops on creative ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods.Events taking place over the weekend include ShareFest in Totnes, Festival of Sustainable Fashion in London’s Hackney and Leeds Community Clothes Exchange.The Charities Aid Foundation is backing the UK’s efforts for global charity event Giving Tuesday on 27 November, which encourages people to do something for – or give something to – a charity they care about.

HSBC was not able to confirm how many customers were affected.“We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,” the bank said.It is the fourth time this month that HSBC has been forced to apologise to customers over mobile or online banking disruptions, with outages also logged on 6, 16 and 18 November.The latest problem came as MPs on the Treasury select committee, in an embarrassing coincidence for HSBC, launched a formal inquiry into banking IT failures, after glitches at Barclays, TSB and Visa affected key services for millions of customers this year.The committee chairwoman, Nicky Morgan, said: “The number of IT failures at banks and other financial institutions in recent years is astonishing. Since becoming chair of the committee 16 months ago, there have been problems at Equifax, TSB, Visa, Barclays, Cashplus and RBS, to name a few.“Millions of customers have been affected by the uncertainty and disruption caused by failures of banking IT systems. Measly apologies and hollow words from financial services institutions will not suffice when consumers aren’t able to access their own money and face delays in paying bills.“As bank branches close and customers are ushered towards online services, the availability of those services is vital.”Figures recently compiled by the consumer group Which? showed the UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years, as companies plough ahead with cost cuts and digital banking drives.The number of branches has dropped from 20,583 in 1988 to 7,586, leaving more customers to rely on online services susceptible to IT blunders.RBS and Barclays – which have closed 424 and about 200 branches respectively over the past year – both experienced IT service disruptions in September that affected online banking customers.HSBC has not closed any branches this year, but customers are still adjusting to a restructuring programme under which the bank reduced its branch network by nearly 400.TSB’s IT meltdown was one of the most high-profile cases in the UK, costing the challenger bank £250m and thousands of lost customers. It had been working to move accounts from an IT system inherited from the bank’s previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to one owned and created by its Spanish owner, Sabadell, back in April.The botched migration locked millions of customers out of their accounts and caused prolonged disruption for account holders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6bdae74ade5a5afd5f41d3a719885472a3b92d7/0_0_1937_2906/master/1937.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8535fdb9298c16621f735fc3b8f9be7 700w","title":"brexit waters fishing industry eu","story":"We are told that Theresa May has betrayed the British fishing industry. We are also told that she fought hard to protect its interests from the rapacious French and Danes. We are told that she kicked the whole can of fish down the road until 2020. Which is correct? Answer: a bouillabaisse of all three.The draft Brexit deal to be put to EU leaders this weekend “betrays”, implicitly, the overblown promises made by some Conservatives and Ukip. It fights off demands by France, Denmark, Spain and others for guarantees of unchanged access to British waters post-Brexit. It leaves all details to be decided until July 2020 and conceivably not until 2022, marooning British fishers inside the EU policy for another two years and possibly another four years.The political declaration recognises Britain’s right to become an “independent coastal state”, ending the automatic rights of Irish and continental boats to fish within the UK 200-mile limit. The document goes on, however, to say: “Within the context of the overall economic partnership the parties should establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, access to waters and quota shares.” Some Conservative MP and fisheries lobbyists insist that that is a sell-out. Fish will become a chip on the negotiating table as Britain’s future trade terms with the EU are hammered out over the next 18 months.Quite the opposite, says the government, backed by the biggest British fishing “union”, the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation. The clause makes it clear that fisheries will be dealt with separately from the rest of the “overall economic partnership”. There will be no trade-off of cod for car parts or herring for life insurance.This is dancing on the head of a haddock. Both arguments miss the point. As Michel Barnier’s deputy Sabine Weyand pointed out in a tweet yesterday, the issue is not fish quotas in return for an overall trade deal. It is continued quotas in return for continuing British fish trade with the continent.It is inconceivable that France, Denmark and the rest will allow Britain easy access to their fish markets if we destroy much of their fishing industries by barring their boats. In any case, tariff-free and easy exports for British fish and shellfish are more important to large parts of the British fisheries industry than the right to increased quotas.This is the issue ignored by the “take back our waters” promises of the Brexiteers. It is the issue now implicitly recognised in the words of the draft Brexit political declaration.If this is taken as a “betrayal” to parts of the fishing industry, it will come as a relief to many others.Other EU governments plan to make a separate declaration at Sunday’s summit that a future fish deal must “build on” existing access and quota rights. This will make life even more uncomfortable for May but will commit other member states,not Britain. It suggests the future fish talks will be stormy – but we knew that already.The bill on post-Brexit, which received its second reading in the House of Commons this week, talks of “auctioning” off repatriated quotas to the highest bidders. Despite Michael Gove’s talk of reviving “fragile” coastal economies, this implies that the sea-lion’s share of the new quotas would go to thriving, big interests, not to struggling small boats and small communities.There is a case for a post-Brexit reshuffle of the pattern of quotas laid down by the Common Fisheries Policy since the mid-1980s. Britain is unfairly penalised by some of the quotas, especially the small amount of cod allocated to English boats in the Channel.But many of the fish caught by continental boats belong to species we don’t eat much (saithe and whiting) or species unfit for human consumption, which go to fatten Danish pigs.There is scope for some reallocation post-Brexit, but not the offshore El Dorado that some fishermen’s leaders and Brexiteers claim. To “buy” continued easy access to EU markets, Britain will have to concede generous quotas to its neighbours (just as Norway already does).If the present Brexit deal survives the House of Commons, there will be no change in fisheries rules until December 2020 or, if the transition is extended, until December 2022. This will disappoint many fishermen but it offers a period in which all sides – government, big interests, small boats, fishers and traders – can throw propaganda overboard and begin to discuss the real long-term interests of the majority of UK fishers and coastal communities.• John Lichfield is a former EU correspondent based in France"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf502d4da2a23b721b76e39fae7a884ac65a3351/0_238_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5d89b62c46f34f66601fe0bb9ae88de","title":"how i finally came to terms with not being able to drive","story":"I foolishly decided to wait for self-driving cars … however the fact that fewer and fewer young people are bothering to learn at least makes me less oddI belong to an exclusive club that most of you have no hope of ever qualifying for.

The situation is less paradoxical than it sounds, because Brexit is a project based on an assertion of what the country does not want to be – a member of the EU – without a clear articulation of what it should be instead. That omission will be felt keenly, but not discussed, at Sunday’s extraordinary summit, where Theresa May and the 27 other European heads of government are expected to agree the broad outlines of a future partnership. But this “deal” will not answer the existential question that Brexit raises: if Britain’s influence in the world is no longer to be deployed as part of a European project, how will it be felt?The leave campaign did not recognise that as a legitimate question because Eurosceptics always saw “Brussels” as a hostile force and a drain on the sovereign power of a nation state. Brexit, in that view, offered enhanced status as “Global Britain”. That fantasy, like so many of the leaver pledges, has been dismantled by events. The dynamics of a 27-to-one negotiation have demonstrated how a continental bloc asserts power greater than the sum of its parts and greater than any one European country can wield alone. Power in the world is not simply a matter of autonomy to sign trade deals. EU membership has been an axiom of British foreign and security policy well beyond the arena of economic cooperation. To jettison that arrangement would have been risky at any point in recent decades. With Donald Trump in the White House, the timing is exquisitely poor. Mr Trump has started a trade war with China that looks like the prologue to a long confrontation between superpowers. Traditionally, a US president would look to Europe for strategic alliance under such circumstances, but Mr Trump has also picked trade fights with Brussels and heaped scorn on the EU.Britain does not have to pick a side in this volatile environment but it will have to express priorities. The national interest will often demand alignment with our continental neighbours. That is a fact of culture, history, geography and realpolitik. Historians will look back and wonder how it was that Britain could make such consequential decisions about its role in the world without them featuring in domestic debate. The parochialism of cabinet rows has crowded out strategic challenges. Urgent, global issues are scarcely discussed: climate change the potential uses and abuses of artificial intelligence and genomics large-scale population migrations. These are forces that will reshape human society, and it is hard to see how a medium-sized, albeit rich, nation can grapple with them alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d90a889fcd34730c441112bc1a07b628be9af29/0_215_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e7cd4b3488aebdd6cae48ee4771965","title":"government universities oxford cambridge moodys","story":"Cambridge and Oxford have high likelihood of support if problems arise, says Moody’sThe government would almost certainly bail out major British universities in financial danger, although less prestigious institutions may not be so lucky, according to a leading credit ratings agency.Moody’s, the international ratings agency, told its clients in a research note that its ratings of universities included a high probability that the government would intervene to prop up an institution in difficulty because of the potential disruption.The report comes despite Moody’s having placed negative warnings on the credit ratings of seven of the nine UK universities that have borrowed funds through international capital markets. Only Oxford and Cambridge are rated as stable by Moody’s.Earlier this month the head of the higher education regulator in England, the Office for Students, said it would not bail out universities in the future. But shortly after, it emerged that the OfS had given a loan worth £900,000 to an unnamed university at risk of running out of cash during the summer.Moody’s said the loan, which the OfS said was subsequently repaid in full, confirmed its view that the regulator and government would be more likely to offer help in the event of insolvency.“This financial assistance supports our assumption of a high probability of extraordinary support for UK universities,” said Jeanne Harrison, a senior analyst at Moody’s. “Our view remains that government links with universities, the OfS’s remit to ensure continuity of education for students, and the economic importance of the university sector provide strong incentives for the government to act to prevent a default by a public university.“Extraordinary support is not limited to financial support and encompasses any government intervention outside of the ordinary course of business to prevent the default of a university in financial distress. Most rated universities receive an uplift of one or two notches to their ratings as a result of our assumption of extraordinary support.”According to Moody’s, both Cambridge and Oxford have a very high probability of government support in the event of financial problems, while the remaining universities – including Manchester and Cardiff – have a high probability of financial aid.“If we were to rate smaller, newer universities, we would likely continue to differentiate on our support assumption and apply a lower assumption for extraordinary support,” Harrison said.Cambridge and Oxford enjoy the agency’s top Aaa credit rating, while Manchester has an Aa2 rating, two notches below. Liverpool, Southampton, Cardiff, De Montfort, Keele and Leeds have Aa3 ratings, along with a negative outlook for future credit ratings.Moody’s said the negative outlooks were the result of sector-wide pressures, including declining numbers of school-leavers, uncertainty around student funding and tuition fees, and Brexit-related risks.“Some rated universities are likely to post operating deficits as a result of these pressures over the next couple years,” the agency said, although it expected credit ratings to remain good thanks to manageable debts and the strong international reputation of UK universities.Universities are also likely to face additional pension costs as the Universities Superannuation Scheme said it would carry out a new valuation of its position after institutions indicated they were willing to pay more to maintain the scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1473ea99027271d3b9edeb6aef037de5c7e81bd5/0_116_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb173a071332dc84ef2e5e6855a91036","title":"hundreds state schools unrepresented top graduate schemes england","story":"State-educated applicants to graduate schemes at top firms come from elite pool – reportApplications to graduate-entry positions at leading law, finance and management firms reveal an “unrecognised apartheid” among England’s state schools, according to research that found more than 1,000 state secondary schools had no former pupils applying to elite programmes.While the success of former independent school pupils in applying to graduate positions has long been recognised, the research by Rare, a specialist recruitment and ersity consultancy, reveals a premier league of state schools that enjoy similar application rates.Rare said the results suggest the traditional split between independent and state schools is not the only iding line in British education. “There is also an unrecognised apartheid within the UK’s state school system, raising serious questions for government, employers and schools alike about how to ensure fair life chances for the country’s young people,” it said.The research examined the applications made by more than 160,000 graduates in 2017-18 to more than 60 graduate recruitment programmes run by companies including Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Slaughter and May.Raph Mokades, Rare’s managing director, said it was misleading to see state schools as a uniform bloc, since most of those in the elite group had a high proportion of students from affluent backgrounds who went on to leading research universities.But Mokades said the data showed school background remained powerful, so that those from lower-performing schools were less likely to apply to elite graduate programmes.“We have found that the university you go to doesn’t completely eradicate the influence of the school that you went to,” Mokades said.“Geography plays a part in this but only a part. We also found high-performing schools that had very few pupils apply, so there is something else going on here,” said Mokades, who argues that employers should do more to identify talent from those schools.The state school that generated the highest numbers of applications was the Henrietta Barnett school, a selective girls’ school in north London with exceptionally high A-level results. But the elite group also included a small number of non-selective schools, such as Coopers’ Company and Coborn school in Havering, which produced high proportions of applicants despite more modest A-level results.According to Mokades, one prime difference was in the quality of a school’s careers advice and contacts with recruiters, which could explain why some schools with strong A-level results produced few applicants.Lucy Powell, the Labour MP and a member of the Commons education select committee, said: “There is no excuse in this day and age for a system that creates preferential treatment to a minority of elite, well-connected schools. We need real careers advice to ensure opportunities are open to all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b248f1b4dc6e253135c0aa11f852e6dfd157ddc7/0_238_4631_2778/master/4631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9f30d4a2b7e7440c20b70d43b4937d","title":"climate change america us government report","story":"Climate change is already harming Americans’ lives with “substantial damages” set to occur as global temperatures threaten to surge beyond internationally agreed limits, a major US government report has warned.The influence of climate change is being felt across the US with increases in disastrous wildfires in the west, flooding on the east coast, soil loss in the midwest and coastal erosion in Alaska, according to the US National Climate Assessment.  saw a draft of the report before publication on Friday.The draft outlined that “impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic wellbeing are rising”. Climate change-related risks “will continue to grow without additional action”, it added.The quadrennial report, the combined work of 13 federal agencies, was released by the Trump administration on the day after Thanksgiving. Scientists who worked on the report said their research was not watered down but claimed the release was timed to bury the findings during the holiday season.Global temperatures could be limited to 2C above pre-industrial era if greenhouse gas emissions are slashed but “without significant reductions, annual average global temperatures could increase by 9F (5C) or more by the end of this century”, a previously released chapter states.Even 2C warming is likely to have major ramifications for societies, as the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report spelled out. Heating the planet well beyond this would create a “totally different world”, said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. “It would be indescribable, it would turn the world upside down in terms of its climate. There would be nothing like it in the history of civilization.”Oppenheimer, with many other scientists, has said warming of around 3C is more likely given the advance of renewable energy and expected emissions reductions in the future. “That is more of an economic, political and technology question,” a report author who wished to remain unnamed told the . “It’s hard to say what we are on track for right now.”The draft report warned that the current response was insufficient to stave off the worst impacts, stating that “neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades”.Another report author said: “Climate change is loading the dice against us, it’s going to affect our water, food and ecosystems. This report is important because it shows it’s already happening where we live, not on far off islands or at the poles.”Included in the dozens of draft report chapters:The national climate assessment is mandated by Congress to compile the latest research on climate change. The last report came out in 2014. Donald Trump has since announced the US will withdraw from the Paris climate deal, with his administration working to dismantle every major policy designed at lowering emissions.The release of the report comes as California is racked by its most deadly wildfire on record, the so-called Camp fire, which razed the town of Paradise. At least 84 people have died and tens of thousands of people have had to flee the fire, which has occurred at the same time as a smaller blaze further south, near Los Angeles.Trump has downplayed assertions by scientists and firefighters that climate change is making California more wildfire-prone, instead pointing to “gross mismanagement” of forest areas. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, has said conservationist lawsuits by “radical environmental groups” were to blame.While visiting devastated parts of California last weekend Trump was asked if what he had seen and heard had changed his mind about climate change, which he has previously called a “hoax”. Trump responded to the question with a firm: “No.”“When there are daily images of California burning up it’s hard for the administration to argue climate change isn’t happening,” said Oppenheimer. “The strategy seems to be let sleeping dogs lie and hope the public doesn’t pay much attention to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db69b5975943b47edd9148a30a0d34eaf6a30d20/0_0_2579_3483/master/2579.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=58054a272f1133d6182d9f88948eafef 1440w","title":"boat neck bateau top velvet slash audrey hepburn","story":"It’s the perfect foil for a huge pair of earrings – reason enough to endear the look to meThis isn’t why I did it, honest, but an unexpected benefit of this column becoming more sustainable through wearing and talking about the clothes we already have, as well as pieces you can buy, is that I get to make out like I was on to all the new “lewks” before anyone else was.For example: the boat neck. You probably think it was Meghan Markle’s Givenchy wedding dress with its wide-slashed, high-rise neckline that rebooted this style, don’t you? Well, sorry, Meg, but I bought this navy velvet top two years ago, from Finery. (It was £45. Finery is such a bargain.) True, I may not have worn it in front of a television audience of 18 million but I did wear it to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at the Vue at the Angel Islington, and to Byron afterwards. (Hey, it was 2016.)OK, maybe this isn’t about me. But the point is, it’s a classic. Audrey Hepburn wore a white lace belted Givenchy boat-neck dress to the 1954 Oscars, where she won best actress for Roman Holiday she wore a black version – also Givenchy, that one with the chic little bow at each shoulder – in Sabrina. Brigitte Bardot and Pablo Picasso both nailed lounging around the south of France looking mesmerisingly sultry and Gallic in the classic Breton variant, which has a similar wide-cut neck.In fact, what is surprising about this neckline is that it isn’t a go-to more often. It is easy to wear because it exposes enough skin to lend a little human warmth to your outfit but in a more straightforward, less loaded manner than a deep v-neck.It can look chic and gamine in a beatnik kind of way with slim, cropped trousers or jeans this season, it’s also a useful pairing with high-waisted trousers. I find high-waisted trousers a lot more difficult to wear in practice than you think they will be. I love the idea of wearing them with a crisp mannish shirt, but the reality is trickier. In my head I am Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story. Then I look in the mirror, and I’m one fake moustache shy of Dandy Dan in Bugsy Malone. With a clean, no-fuss neckline, elegance in a high-waisted, wide-legged trouser is more achievable.What’s more, a boat neck is the perfect foil for a huge pair of earrings. This alone is more than reason enough to endear the look to me. But should you need further persuasion, then surely a royal warrant seals the deal.• Jess wears top, Jess’ own.

The animation, the Hollywood version of Edwardian England, the playful verbosity of the songs and above all, the presentation of Mrs Banks as a larky suffragette are understood to have enraged the Australian author, as, surely would this: the co-option of Mary Poppins as a feminist.It is an irritating reflex to take beloved figures from childhood fiction and bend them to adult political ends, but it is particularly perverse in the case of Poppins, given her creator’s dislike of piety. The original Poppins is not quite the spit-spot version with whom most of us are familiar, but a far darker, more irregular creature, powered in places by what reads as sublimated rage and inclined to embrace something that sails close to atheism.None of which is to say that Travers was right to despise the Disney version. After many years of not watching or thinking about the movie, I have been forced to re-engage with it as my children work their way through the Disney back catalogue and in anticipation of Mary Poppins Returns, the Emily Blunt reboot, directed by Rob Marshall and due to open at Christmas. What strikes me is how devastating the original film was.Poppins is a cypher at the heart of the movie who exerts influence not, as Mr Banks specifies in his advert in the Times, by being a “nanny who can give commands”, but in accordance with the principle that one changes others by changing one’s behaviour around them – in the case of Poppins – through a combination of beady observation and strategic obliviousness. She is impatient, indignant, above all incredulous when presented with the weakness of others. (“Are you unwell?” she asks Mr Banks after doing some light magic at him and in what we would, these days, identify as gas lighting.)Which is not to say Poppins is anything but good. She is, however, clearly a woman acquainted with the limitations of others and while she is sent to the Banks household to comfort sad children, it is also her mission to critique the English: coldness as a vehicle for stability blind adherence to tradition and emotional detachment as modes mistaken for virtue, all of which, over the course of the movie, Poppins smartly dismantles.There might have been a question of warmth with the character, were Julie Andrews not such a nuanced performer and there is real pathos in her Poppins, not just in the sadness when she says goodbye to the children, but in the nearest the movie gets to a torch song – a top pick for karaoke! – Feed the Birds. This is fanciful, but when she sings about the Bird Woman I always think Poppins is recognising the ease with which she, or any woman, might slip down the ladder, if we do not adhere to various misogynistic standards. The mad woman on the steps of St Paul’s is all of us and do not make me quote Gilbert and Gubar to prove it.Still, the question of feminism in the movie is a tricky one, not least because the film explicitly mocks the limitations of this kind of labelling, setting up Mrs Banks as a suffragette who is militant outside Downing Street – “take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again!” – and submissive at home. (The true feminist statement of the film is, of course, the heroine’s retort to Mr Banks: “Let me make one thing quite clear I never explain anything.”)This is not quite true. For all her seeming invulnerability, Poppins exhibits regret at the end of the movie in a tender moment with her talking umbrella. She is a stoic who counters the stoicism of Mr Banks, an epitome of Englishness charged with the very American project of making those around her articulate their anxieties. (Notably David Tomlinson, who as Mr Banks delivers the heartbreaking monologue about his failures as a parent, a man “brought to rack an’ ruin in his prime.”) She does not have a love interest, which in the context of Hollywood heroines might be considered the most radical thing about her.What is it she teaches the children? Empathy mindfulness a sneaky determination to win (at the horse race). Tidiness. Not to gush. Not to worry, overly, about whether or not they are liked. Simultaneously to believe and not believe what they see. As in the books, she denies to the children that anything magical has happened, inculcating scepticism and something worthwhile about view point.In fact, scepticism is her greatest asset a stand against credulousness and therefore systems, social and political, which would have the children mindlessly repeat what came before simply because it is familiar. And then she buggers off, truly a shocking moment of childhood. I remember the first time I saw this and could not believe a film was allowed to behave this way, break one’s heart so insistently then pretend the reunification of the Banks family was, in fact, a happy ending. No child I know bought into this. Poppins’ departure presages death and even as eight-year-olds, at some level, we knew it.And so she will fly back into our lives this Christmas. The makers of the new film say it is their intention to reintroduce joy at a particularly grim moment in history, but with Poppins it was never a question of joy pure and simple. It was, instead, a question of joy against the backdrop of the film’s only certainty, that whatever happens, the wind will change. It is not much as reassurance goes, but it will have to do.Mary Poppins Returns is released on 19 December in the US and 21 December in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd0fc680104c61ca236945cc07be4c9c4be11540/0_177_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69c807c57808ed3bf95806e356cf25ea","title":"english sparkling wine tops which taste test of non champagne fizz","story":"Surrey-made £16 bubbly outclasses foreign rivals such as prosecco, cava and crémantA £16 English sparkling wine made in Surrey has triumphed in an annual consumer taste test of supermarket alternatives to champagne and been named as one of the best value deals for Christmas.Denbies Chalk Valley English Sparkling Brut (non-vintage), sold only by Morrisons, scooped the top score of 77 points out of 100 in the Which? tasting, beating highly rated imported rivals such as prosecco, cava and crémant.Made from grapes grown in long-established vineyards just outside Dorking, the winning wine was praised by the judging panel for its “brisk fizz and tropical fruity flavour”. Panellists said it had baked apple and elderflower flavours while one likened the aroma of the fizz to lychees. It also scooped one of three coveted ‘Best Buy’ awards.Which? asked supermarkets to nominate their choice of a vintage or non-vintage (NV) champagne alternative for its pre-Christmas taste test. Entries had to be either own-label or exclusive, dry (brut), white, from any grape or blend and priced between £7.50 and £20.The sparkling wine panel experts blind-tasted nine champagne alternatives, working their way through a total of 240 glasses.“For those looking for a change from prosecco this Christmas, our Best Buy English fizz is an excellent option” said Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine. “The quality and choice on offer this year is good news for lovers of sparkling wine. Whether you’re keen to try something different or you’re a die-hard prosecco fan, our experts have found some great supermarket offerings.”Morrisons’ wine expert, Clive Donaldson, said: “This bubbly offers customers the best of English wine making and will make a splash at any Christmas party.”The second Which? Best Buy – notching up a score of 76 – went to a French sparkling wine. Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Crémant (£11) was praised by the experts as “simple and refreshing” with “attractive herbal and pear notes”.A well-kept secret and alternative to prosecco was the fashionable Italian fizz franciacorta, Which? said. It is made from grapes from the region in Lombardy. Drier than prosecco, it is described as fruitier and softer than champagne, with distinctive lemony notes.The Tesco Finest Franciacorta DOCG Brut (£15) was scored at 75, after judges hailed the “clean, fresh” sparkling wine as a good choice for those who like “gently frothy” bubbles. They said it had a “fine, almost shy mousse”.Asda served up the highest-scoring prosecco. Its Extra Special Prosecco Asolo Brut DOCG – priced at £8 – edged ahead of strong competition from Lidl, Aldi and the Co-op to be awarded 71 by the panel. Describing it as “fun and frothy”, the experts detected “notes of peach and pear.”The consumer group’s wine experts recently also tasted 15 champagnes – all brut (dry) and costing £35 or less. It found that the Co-op’s own-brand champagne was as good as GH Mumm Cordon Rouge, better than Moët \u0026amp Chandon and the best value Christmas bubbly.The British drank 34.4m gallons of sparkling wine last year, but the growth in sales of prosecco has slowed markedly, with drinkers switching to £10 bottles of crémant as a cheap alternative to champagne.The triumph of the homegrown fizz crowns another strong year for the sector. The fall in sterling has handed a Brexit bonus to English sparkling wines, with many considered to match premium French champagnes in quality but now priced the same or less.In a further boost for English producers, the Ridgeview estate in Sussex was this week awarded the coveted trophy of the world’s best winemaker in the International Wine \u0026amp Spirit Competition 2018. This is the first time in the IWSC’s 49-year history that the award has been presented to an English producer.Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “2018 is proving to be a corking year for English wine. The increased number of vineyards, heatwave and warm autumn have resulted in a bumper harvest for our wine producers, who are delighted with the quality of the grapes.“On top of this, Ridgeview has been crowned the world’s best winemaker, which is a ‘first’ and a sensational achievement. English wine has well and truly earned a world-class reputation for excellence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f410ad2088a59250d5a1101b4a6ccb1f7668470c/43_121_2372_1424/master/2372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a993bc1afe1ecda6e45f568aa472f98d","title":"jose mourinho says martial shaw rashford lingard lack maturity manchester united","story":"• Manager says they are ‘boys with great potential, but lacking’ • Adds ‘spoiled kids’ are more prevalent in today’s societyJosé Mourinho believes Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard need to become more competitive to realise their potential, with Manchester United’s manager stating that generally the new generation of footballers are too pampered.The quartet are United’s brightest young players, yet Mourinho continues to strive to help them comprehend what is needed if they are to take a place among the elite.Mourinho was interviewed by Hristo Stoichkov, the former Barcelona and Bulgaria forward with whom the Portuguese worked at the Camp Nou in the mid-90s.Mourinho added: “In English, in the United States, people might say ‘spoiled’ or ‘spoiled kids’.“Our children are more spoiled than we were by our own parents. We were more mature, we were better prepared. I think today’s kids have a different social life than ours and today’s players also have their surroundings, a word that was used a lot in Barcelona, the interior environment.“In Barcelona, when they talk about the environment, they’re talking about a more global sense in relation to the club. When I use this word ‘environment’ I’m using it more in relation to the personal environment, to the people that come around the players, that protect them too much, who give them too much affection, too many excuses. Always making excuses makes you mature more slowly.Mourinho also believes that there is no possibility that Alexis Sánchez will be sold in January. The former Arsenal forward has been in uneven form this season and is thought to be unsettled.The manager is consistent in stating he will not keep a player at the club if they wish to leave. When reminded of this and asked whether there was any prospect of Sánchez departing, Mourinho said: “I don’t think he will leave because he never told me that he wants to leave or isn’t happy to stay. He is improving like the team is improving and when he plays he is giving us his personality, his desire to play and to produce for the team and trying to adapt to how we play. Can he do better? I think we can all do better. I can do better and he can do better and all the other players can also do better.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0117d3672a56f23d5f861f355c0f1264eb72a775/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7935cd90010e74df43bf64f39b54dbc5","title":"the secrets of maurizio sarri","story":"Four people who have worked closely with Maurizio Sarri explain what makes the manager so special as his Chelsea side prepare to face TottenhamSpent three years under Sarri at Empoli, scoring 50 goals. Also played for MiddlesbroughI owe a lot to Sarri. When I signed for Empoli I was demotivated and he gave me back the desire to play football. The minute I started working with Maurizio I couldn’t wait for Sunday to arrive so that I could play. I can tell you that if you work with Sarri you feel as if you are on another planet. I can understand why Ross Barkley said that he had already learned so much from him.Here is why: Maurizio knows how to give you confidence in your ability but he is also with you every step of the road, checking on how you are doing, noticing what you are doing right and wrong. The consistency and quality of the training sessions are remarkable and players respect him.At Empoli my strike partner Francesco Tavano and I were 33 and 34, so Sarri found a tactical approach which enabled him to play in a way that didn’t fatigue us too much. It worked perfectly, and then players follow blindly.Maurizio is always calm. But if you don’t follow his ideas on football and you start doing things your way, he gets annoyed. He holds everything inside during the game – two screams maybe – then on Tuesday when training starts again he spends half an hour explaining everything. He’s a teacher.Appointed Sarri in 2012. Sarri took the team into Serie A in his second season and left for Napoli a year laterOne day my sporting director Marcello Carli said to me: ‘Talk to this man, after two minutes you’ll be enthralled.’ That man was Maurizio. It was like magic right away – in one face-to-face meeting I saw the passion and energy.Every day I follow the training sessions and I’ll tell you one thing: Maurizio is capable of a magic trick. During every session he transmits his knowledge of football, his idea, to every player. He defends his choice to play offensive football regardless of the opponent.At Empoli we have a small room behind the training pitch that became like his home. Even his time off was spent in that room studying opponents. And Sarri never gets tired despite the 60 cigarettes a day!When he joined Napoli I asked myself: ‘Will Maurizio be able to convince champions with his ideas?’ But I found out after sending a few text messages that after two days he had a very strong bond with Gonzalo Higuaín and I figured he would be a success.Cremonese midfielder who played for Sarri at a number of clubsSarri is very superstitious. For instance he always parked in the same place. One time, a teammate arrived at training before Sarri and parked in his spot as a joke. The coach’s reaction was amazing: he hit the car until the player moved it. They laughed about it afterwards but that shows you what Sarri is like, how intense he is.But players love Sarri because he makes working for him fun and his other big secret is getting into players’ minds. He expects you to work like you would during the match. He’s like a maniac every detail is addressed carefully and those who don’t give their all in training are lost. Sarri makes his players believe they can achieve anything. At Empoli, whenever we had an important match against a bigger team, say Juventus or Milan, Sarri would give the players a speech that would last for an hour. He never said a word about playing defensively or limiting damage. Instead he would say: ‘I want a bunch of crazy players who play to win even on this pitch. You need to be even more ambitious and arrogant than you normally are.’Right-back for Sarri at Sorrento in 2011-12Maurizio didn’t only want to win, he wanted more. He always told us we must command the game. One time we had a very difficult away game and produced the perfect performance. Afterwards we were on the bus, all pumped up. We waited five, 10, 20 minutes and there was no sign of Sarri. Half an hour later he arrived, apologised and said he was waiting for the DVD so he could watch it on the way back. He wanted to fix the mistakes and take notes. He was on the computer for the entire four-hour trip: incredible.Sarri is a perfectionist but in a good way. If you miss a pass by 10cm, he looks for ways to improve you. His idea is that the team should memorise what they should do. During every session you go over the same script while having fun. His view is that training should never be too long, you must always have the ball at your feet and the defensive line must be perfect. Off the pitch he’s a marvellous person on the pitch he’s very demanding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075e440cfb32e5dddc6a8a64aa3745c280945414/0_0_3809_2286/master/3809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd85e1cde16db244d398fe382a880dc4","title":"world cup two years fifa conmebol","story":"Conmebol is lobbying Fifa to stage the World Cup every two years rather than every four, president Alejandro Domínguez confirmed on Friday.Having seen the success of the Uefa Nations League, he would also be open to the possibility of expanding that to include South American teams.“The proposal we have made to Fifa is to play the World Cup every two years and not every four,” Domínguez said. “Instead of having the Nations League in between we can just go ahead every two years and have a World Cup and that is for everyone.“It’s for the players because they could play four World Cups if we move to a two-year cycle. If we stay with this format many players will not be able to play more than two.“There are many solutions. We could hold the tournament in Europe, South America, North America, Africa and Asia without such a long wait. So we see an opportunity there and there is a proposal put forward to Fifa.”Money, needless to say, is a motivating factor. “In terms of economics Fifa make money and give more money,” Domínguez said.What that means for the existing continental tournaments is unclear. Domínguez insists he gets on well with both the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and the Uefa president, Aleksandar Ceferin, holding a global tournament in a slot currently reserved for the European Championship would clearly be to the benefit of Fifa.The Nations League is an appealing prospect and could serve as a compromise solution rather than abandoning the present structure altogether.Domínguez’s position at present is essentially that he is open to dialogue and keen to prevent Europe moving even further ahead of South America, economically and technically, than it already is. “I always say we have to work together and never say no, I always say why not,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0896d891886a2064659645ccfbb181e2845197b2/0_66_1020_612/master/1020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11f7e45d5e5a5e87b56428d7adc3f616","title":"uk pledges 50m to end female genital mutilation by 2030","story":"Money will go to grassroots programmes across Africa in bid to protect millions of girls currently at risk of being cutThe UK government is to invest £50m in an attempt to end female genital mutilation by 2030, claiming it is the biggest single investment to tackle the issue by an international donor.The money, announced on Friday, will go to grassroots programmes working to stop the practice across Africa, where prevalence is highest. Penny Mordaunt, international development secretary, said the investment was key to also ending FGM in the UK.“Inspirational, courageous African women are leading efforts to end the practice in their own countries, and thanks to them, more communities are starting to abandon the practice.“But progress is at a critical juncture and we must work to protect the millions of girls that are still at risk of being cut. We also can’t end FGM in the UK without ending it globally.”At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM – the cutting of female genitals – and an estimated 69 million more girls will be cut over the next 12 years unless action is taken. The UN general assembly has agreed to work to end FGM by 2030 under the sustainable development goals.Brendan Wynne, from Donor Direct Action, which runs an End FGM fund, said: “Such additional funding is incredibly welcome but this time around we have to make sure that it actually reaches those women on the frontlines who are working so hard and so successfully to help end FGM. We should not tell them how to do this, but rather get behind them and support their leadership. They know what they are doing and should be trusted.”In Sudan the money will be used to expand the Saleema Initiative, set up in 2008 by the National Council for Child Welfare and Unicef Sudan. Saleema – “whole” in Arabic – runs 263 clubs at schools where girls – some who will already have been cut - discuss FGM and their rights as girls.Malak Abdulrahman al-Awad, age 15, from Um al-Qura, is an active member of the club at her school and has managed to prevent girls undergoing FGM.“I was cut and all my sisters are cut but I am an active member of the girls’ club. Everyone in my school is part of the girls’ club. We learned about the reporting of FGM and the consequences and how it is not religious.”When she heard that her cousin was to be cut, she took action: “I went and saw the midwife and saw the girl had already begun to cut the girls. There were lots of girls there who were going to be cut.“I went to my teacher.

But at some point my mic must have been turned onRecently, I received an angry voice message from my Auntie B. “What do you think you are doing, telling your little cousin to disobey me?”Nobody does melodrama quite like my auntie. She’s committed. She’s the kind of person who would search “sad violins” on YouTube to ensure her tirade had a soundtrack. She probably rehearsed her speech in the mirror. It contained all the standard Asian drama touchpoints – rant, mumble, “disrespect”, rant, mumble, “shame on the family” – before the inevitable brass-section finale: “You’ll regret this when I’m dead!” A masterpiece, really.I’ve been thinking about this message a lot. I’m not concerned that I upset my aunt by helping my younger (but fully grown) cousin get a tattoo, but rather by what came next: “I just worry,” she said calmly, having exhausted herself. “Is she doing it because she’s angry? She won’t speak to me. How do I get through?”In my community especially, there are firm rules about how the family is organised. The young ones are to be seen and not heard, and the elders respected at all costs.

I do not. They often ask why not, but I cannot tell them. The real reason is because I am a failure, both personally and professionally, and have been for most of my life. There are many causes – a mental health condition that it would be immoral to pass on, a date rape, an abusive relationship, a promising career destroyed by both the economy and my own poor decisions. I have discussed some of these issues with the couple of women I have known for many years. Hopefully you will understand why I do not wish to discuss them with those of short acquaintances, but I do want to make friends with them (I lack a regular, nearby support network). How do I tell them to get their noses out of my private business while still saying, hey, let’s be friends?You need to be kinder to yourself. You are not a failure. Living with a mental health condition and surviving a date rape and an abusive relationship does not make you a failure – how could it? I can’t comment on whether you have made wrong decisions in your career, but if you have, that wouldn’t make you unusual. Some great conclusions have been reached on a path of bad choices. So the reason for you not having children, I would argue, is because you are a survivor, not a failure. You chose not to have them. That is commendable. Every day I receive letters highlighting the damage wrought on children by people who went into parenthood without such cogent thought.Women who haven’t had children elicit curiosity in a way that men who made the same decision don’t. It makes people uncomfortable. I recently told an old friend – a mother of four – that a family member hadn’t had children. “I bet she regrets it, but can’t admit it,” the friend said. I bristled – she couldn’t grasp that my relative really didn’t regret it.But let’s look less at the subject matter and more at how to answer a question you don’t really want to answer. People tend to ask questions either to make small talk (and don’t really care what the answer is), because they are genuinely interested, or to validate their own decisions. Either way, it’s important that you stay in control of the answer you should not be swayed by the effect that it has on the other person – that’s their responsibility. Your responsibility is how you choose to answer it. The more words you use to explain a decision you’ve made, the more you give the other person to pick apart. Thus – in the circumstances you describe – it’s perfectly acceptable to answer very succinctly, then bat it back to them to let them deal with it.This is hard because, depending on your personality, the question asked and what nerves it hits, we often feel the need to over-explain ourselves, even to perfect strangers. You might want to think about what stops you just smiling and saying, “No”, in reply to, “Do you have children?” I mean, that’s factual, isn’t it? Do you fear their discomfort at such a short answer, or more questions? If they ask, “Why not?” you could then say, “I chose not to, now what about you? Do you have children?” After all, given half a chance, most people love talking about themselves. Let them validate their own decisions.Don’t let the subject of you not having children dominate the conversation, and you should find that the other person won’t let it, either. Be confident, not cowed or apologetic in your answer, and remember: make it about them.Can I convince you to get some support for yourself about your past?

The friend who advises you to, say, stay in your relationship or leave your job may well be looking out for you but she’s inescapably looking out for herself, too, whether she realises it or not. Maybe she believes her own marriage was a case of settling, and wants you to join the club. Maybe she adores your company so much she could never recommend a career step that might involve your leaving town.Moreover, research suggests that, in the absence of incentives to the contrary, people will generally advise you to act more cautiously than they would act themselves in a similar situation – perhaps because they don’t want it on their conscience if you take a daring leap and fall flat on your face.There’s a happy flipside to this, though, for parents, teachers, managers and anyone else who finds themselves in the position of needing to motivate others: far better than giving them advice is to give them the opportunity to give advice. That’s the conclusion of a new study by psychologists at the universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania, who found that American middle-school pupils were much more enthusiastic about doing their homework after dispensing advice on the topic to younger children, as compared with after receiving advice from teachers. This motivational effect lasted weeks, and was also observed among adults who were attempting to lose weight, save money, control their temper or find a job. Teach a man to fish and he’ll know how to fish – but get him to teach others how to fish, and he might actually get on with some damned fishing.This result isn’t all that surprising, I suppose, when you consider how flattering it feels to be invited to give advice. (Frankly, it’s only slightly less ego-boosting to give it anyway, even when not invited.) Faced with a challenge, we tend to assume we need to seek advice in order to obtain more knowledge about how to proceed yet the truth, very often, is that we know exactly what we need to do – we just lack the confidence to do it. The act of giving advice reacquaints us with the knowledge we already possess, which instils confidence, which motivates action.This, by the way, is another good reason to keep a journal: you can use it to advise yourself. Your friends may have limited patience with your habit of lecturing them on their lives in order to feel better about your own (I know mine do!), but a leather-effect notebook never complains.Finally, this is a reminder that there are few bigger compliments you can pay another person than to ask, preferably sincerely, for their advice. Benjamin Franklin famously observed that to ingratiate yourself with someone, it’s better to ask for a favour than to perform one: the favour-doer will come to think of you as the decent and likable sort for whom they do favours.The same surely applies to advice: rather than giving it, ask for it. Though I should add that if you have any insights on this matter yourself – what with you being such a wise and thoughtful person, with such rich life experience – I’m definitely all ears.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun. If we dig deeper, there’s probably something in there about fearing rejection. Regardless, I’m officially taking off my big cynical hat. The neighbours are coming for dinner next week and I might even join GoodGym permanently – you get a free red T-shirt and everything.1 Learn a new skillExpand your horizons by signing up for local night and weekend classes – a quick way to find like-minded people keen to embrace a new challenge.2 Try a supper clubSharing home-cooked food and maybe a bottle of wine with strangers at a dinner party in a secret location is always going to be an interesting experience.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee8b2293862bc00ded327e450d69ddf9f12929dc/0_172_5165_3100/master/5165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61cfc7e56282614adfd2cdeef135522f","title":"how hapless wool got blanketed by petas shock publicity","story":"Animal rights activists follow long PR practice of capitalising on quirky place namesUntil this week the main claim to fame of the quiet Dorset village of Wool, complete with thatched cottages and an Elizabethan bridge, was its status as the setting for key scenes in the novel Tess of the d’Urbervilles by local author Thomas Hardy.This changed on Monday when the parish council received a letter making an offer: if they would rename the village as Vegan Wool, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) would send 2,000 “cruelty-free” fake wool blankets to residents. Inadvertently, the village had been sucked into the incredibly effective PR outrage machine which Peta has run for many years.The story made headlines in Britain in print, online and on television including ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Peta had been ridiculed and mocked, the stories said. And yet, somehow, the charity was delighted.“If it takes us looking silly in order to get these issues into the public domain, so be it,” said Peta’s UK director, Elisa Allen. “It’s not controversy or criticism that’s our biggest enemy it’s silence and ignorance.”Allen said Peta had previously struggled to gain coverage for its undercover filming of the treatment of animals at sheep farms. “We went to the media and most outlets refused to run it because it’s too gory and violent to be seen. We went back to the drawing board and we understand that we have to be creative to get these issues out into the public domain,” she said.Veteran PR Mark Borkowski said publicists have a “heroic heritage” of generating coverage by hijacking a city or town with a quirky name. “This was first deployed by the arch-publicist Jim Moran back in the 50s. He used Fleatown, Ohio, to launch a chemical which could eradicate animal mites. Hell in Michigan was the test bed for a quit smoking campaign. Intercourse, Pennsylvania, was the unfortunate city to launch a prophylactic,” he said.He said stirring up controversy and angering Peta’s opponents was an easy way to gain coverage. “I am sure those who enjoy ribbing the woke vegans will generate ink and commentary giving the subject a wider discourse. All light and shade in search of a debate.”The campaigning organisation has a reputation for going to any length to gain media attention, headlines and heavy criticism for its recurring campaigns in which celebrities strip off for photoshoots, starting with an infamous campaign from 1994 featuring a nude Naomi Campbell and four other models under the heading “We’d rather go naked naked than wear fur”.Since then it has sent scantily clad models to Wimbledon, convinced Pamela Anderson to pose labelled with different cuts of beef, dressed up as Ku Klux Klan members at a US dog show and proposed ice cream made with human breast milk.Most locals saw the funny side of the proposal to rename Wool, according to district councillor Laura Miller, a former vegan who only occasionally eats meat.“There is a slight resentfulness because we’re a small rural community and we’ve got a butchers and farm shop so we’ve got more of an idea about animal welfare that most,” she said. “We don’t particularly want to be used as a gimmick but we’re not going to overreact. We didn’t really get a choice in the matter, which is why I’m speaking to people and saying that it’s a wonderful village and a great place to live.”Miller said the village’s name had nothing to do with wool, despite the existence of sheep farms in the area. Instead, it is derived from the historic word “welle”, believed to relate to the springs in the area.Despite this, the councillor confirmed that the renaming proposal would be duly considered at next week’s parish council meeting: “It would be a nice gesture now that they’ve got their publicity if Peta could give those blankets to a homeless charity given we didn’t ask to be dragged into this campaign. Our local farmers would be horrified to see any suggestions of cruelty to sheep while they’re being shorn.”Peta insists it has no plans to change tactics and is delighted with the coverage of this week’s stunt. “The fact that we have got the nation talking about an industry that previously people didn’t associate with animal cruelty speaks volumes,” said Allen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

But it turns out they’re more politically vocal than most pop phenomenaSequestered in the corner of an east London restaurant, Clean Bandit are having a hard time describing their fans. “Age-wise, it’s very broad,” says cellist, producer, and de facto front-person Grace Chatto. “It doesn’t feel like it’s any particular type of person – it’s just a big group of, er, random people,” laughs producer Jack Patterson. With a frankly ludicrous 4bn global streams making them one of the UK’s most successful bands, their difficulty in finding a neat catch-all is pretty understandable.In accordance with modern pop rules, these fans have given themselves a collective noun – “fandits” – and while Grace is adamant that they’re “really nice” and “don’t battle with other fandoms”, Patterson is reminded of a more sinister experience. “This one fan wrote to all my friends saying she had a dark secret about me,” he says, pushing the dregs of a caesar salad around his plate. “Then she sent a photo that was meant to be proof of something,” laughs his brother Luke, the group’s drummer. “But it wasn’t even you.”It is a telling anecdote from a band who have maintained near anonymity (Jack says he often gets mistaken for the tennis player Andy Murray) in the face of huge success. Their 2014 Jess Glynne-assisted, Grammy-winning Rather Be alchemised the band’s fusion of classical and handbag house into a million-selling single, spending four weeks at No 1 and gatecrashing the US Top 10. It was followed by four more Top 10 singles and then, in 2016, by Rockabye’s ludicrous conjoining of dancehall, a near 400-year-old nursery rhyme and Sean Paul rapping about single mums. It spent nine weeks at No 1 in the UK and took the Christmas top spot. Rockabye features on their restlessly inventive second album What Is Love?, which, as well as containing two more chart-toppers (string-drenched weepie Symphony, featuring Zara Larsson, and the juddery electro of Solo alongside Demi Lovato), also comes with a genre-agnostic, Spotify-friendly gaggle of collaborators, from Ellie Goulding to Stefflon Don, via Craig David, Rita Ora and Outkast’s Big Boi.The group have spearheaded a new kind of Avengers-style pop, with multiple star turns helping lesser-known artists such as Benny Blanco, Jonas Blue and Tiësto to the upper reaches of the charts. But Clean Bandit remain ultimately reliant on the mercurial pizzazz of proper pop stars front of house, so what are people’s perceptions of them as a band? “They don’t have any perceptions,” says Grace. “I still feel like most people don’t know much about us,” shrugs Luke.While the perception is that Clean Bandit arrived seemingly fully formed and focus-grouped with Rather Be, they enjoyed the early hustle, gigging constantly and hosting their own club night, National Rail Disco. Back in London, it was Grace who would constantly harangue MTV to ask why it wasn’t playing the self-directed video for Mozart’s House. When she was told it would only play it once the song had some traction on radio, she found a radio plugger and gave him the equivalent of a month’s rent in cash. “We couldn’t even afford to get the tube at that point,” she remembers. “Within a few weeks, Radio 1 was playing it and then, all of a sudden, all these lawyers and managers contacted us.”They signed to a major label, Atlantic Records, in 2012 and the re-released Mozart’s House peaked at No 17 a year later. For a while, before the success of Rather Be, they planned to focus solely on making videos and started a production company called Clean Film in 2011. “Shooting videos is the most intense, full-body experience,” beams Grace. “It’s almost like a ritualistic, sadomasochistic process that we have to put ourselves through after every song’s finished,” adds Jack. “We have to self-flagellate and punish ourselves.”That’s not to say they have avoided controversy altogether. In fact, Mozart’s House cost Grace her pre-fame job. “I was teaching cello in a school and some of the kids found the video and the parents complained that it was inappropriate,” she says, referencing a section where she strolls through a car park with a violin covering her bare chest. “That notion that female skin is somehow dirty or inappropriate for children is such a bad message.” She says she was also determined to keep a scene of her masturbating in the video for Solo. “I had kickback from the label saying: ‘What if children ask their parents what’s going on?’ And I was like: ‘Well, that’s fine, if they do ask their mums, then they won’t find out from other things on the internet.’ Those scenes were important for me to put in because seeing women masturbating is not something that happens in popular culture, unless it’s with a hetero male gaze.”In October 2016, violinist Amin-Smith quit. While Grace seems genuinely sad when I ask if they had any idea he was unhappy (“He always loved doing lots of other things,” she says), she is more robust when it comes to a tweet he posted in July that criticised an interview she gave about the band’s decision to play in Israel. “I find musicians and DJs pulling out of performances there a self-defeating act,” she says. “I’m not really sure what they hope to achieve and the suggestion that playing in a country means you support the political or foreign policy of that country is ridiculous, especially if you’re not willing to play there but play in America or the UK. Me wanting to play in Israel is not me making a statement about what’s going on there.”An early version of Rockabye featured vocals by the Norwegian singer Ina Wroldsen, who had written the song about her young son under the impression that she would be the featured artist. Somewhere along the line she was swapped for label mate Anne-Marie. “That was taken out of our hands,” says Jack. “It was a terrible situation and I fought with people for a couple of months and in the end there was nothing we could do,” adds Grace. They are keen to reiterate it wasn’t anything to do with Anne-Marie herself (“She’s one of our favourite singers at the moment”), but the fallout almost led to Grace quitting the band. “I did feel like I couldn’t do it any more because the idea that my business was hurting people … that was really painful. I went completely crazy for a while after that. I just had to carry on, but inside it was really hard.”Famous yet faceless identity-free yet politically active detached yet deeply passionate about what they do, Clean Bandit remain one of the strangest entities in British pop. “On paper it does sound like a car crash,” says Grace. “There was never any plan, though. This was kind of an accident.”• What is Love? is released on 30 November on Atlantic This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Not a hit, for some reason.You could see why Bush chose to trail the Director’s Cut album, where she reinterpreted songs from her back catalogue, with Deeper Understanding – its lyric about the isolating effects of technology seems weirdly prescient for a song from the 80s. But it’s one instance where the original, replete with ethereal vocals by Trio Bulgarka (subsequently swamped by a guest appearance by Bush’s son, Bertie), is better.A forgotten and atypical Bush single – a straight orchestral reading of the Great American Songbook standard, recorded for a tribute album of Gershwin songs by the legendary harmonica player Larry Adler. Very nice, but inessential.Kate Bush had a whole album’s worth of flatly brilliant, at least vaguely festive-themed music in her – 2011’s 50 Words for Snow – but her first attempt at a Christmas single 31 years earlier fell oddly flat, never quite sounding as magical as its title suggests.Bush is no fan of her second album, Lionheart, saying in 2005: “I just didn’t like it.” Its flop lead single Hammer Horror wasn’t quite up to the standard set by her debut LP, The Kick Inside: it feels strained, as if it’s trying a bit too hard to sound kooky. That said, the dramatic orchestral arrangement is great.A single by default, not design: it charted on downloads from the soundtrack album of The Golden Compass alone. Belying Bush’s reputation as a pernickety studio perfectionist, it apparently took 10 days to write and record. It’s not her greatest song, but its ambient synth and choral backing is luscious and enveloping.The Red Shoes was one song vastly improved by Bush’s rerecording on Director’s Cut. The original single was fine, its lyrical exploration of the creative impulse chafing against its perky folk backing, but the new version trumped it: darker, more insistent, more powerful.It’s tempting to see Experiment IV’s lyric – about scientists impelled to make a lethal sonic weapon – as a kind of allegory for Bush’s perfectionist approach to recording and belief in music’s power. Either way, it’s a more direct and undemanding piece of music than her preceding singles, from Hounds of Love, its mid-80s sound more dated.Other countries got the extraordinary if impenetrable Suspended in Gaffa as a single from The Dreaming. In Britain, it was the less abrasive, but similarly Kurt Weill-ish There Goes a Tenner. Its shifts from am-dram oompah to hypnagogic ambience are suitably unsettling and odd.The last single that Bush put out before her 11-year absence from the release schedules is suitably downbeat – “whatever happens, what really matters?” – and decorated with guitar solos by Eric Clapton. It’s another track improved by its Director’s Cut makeover, its glossy feel replaced with something mistier and more touching.It seems odd to think of how Bush was once popularly perceived: not with the reverence she’s held in now, but as a dippy space cadet with a penchant for saying “wow”. Then again, The Big Sky is essentially a song about how nice clouds are. Still, its wide-eyed glee is genuinely infectious.Seemingly released as a single to disabuse anyone who thought 50 Words for Snow might be a straightforward Christmas album, Wild Man deals with sightings of the yeti, features both Andy Fairweather-Low, pretending to be a Nepalese mountain-dweller, and an addictive, insistent guitar riff.Cut from a similar musical cloth to The Big Sky – percussion-heavy, giddy – Love and Anger might be the most bizarrely upbeat song ever written about a relationship curdling because of a partner’s refusal to say what they really mean. You’re left unsure if the problem is a dark secret or just passive aggression, but the music is transcendent.Another of the songs re-recorded on Director’s Cut, The Sensual World was fine to start with: a little oblique for a single, perhaps, but its drowsy flow of erotic, James Joyce-inspired imagery works spectacularly well. Classic only-Kate-Bush-would-do-this twist: it’s interpolated with traditional Macedonian music played on the uilleann pipes.As straightforwardly pop as Bush ever got, famed for a video that looks like a dream a Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons-playing pervert once had, Babooshka is still irresistible: its howled chorus unshakeable, the sound of smashing glass presaging 80s sample-mania.The one undisputed classic on Lionheart. It’s hard to imagine anyone other than Bush making a subject as ordinary as an underemployed, second-rate actor – “he’ll never make The Sweeney” – quite so eerie and epic, beautifully drawing the gulf between the gushing praise of his friends and the lonely reality of his life.The Red Shoes was an album frequently haunted by loss, never more so than on this moving piano ballad, on which Bush listed dead friends by name, quoted adages used by her late mother and concluded: “Just being alive – it can hurt so much.”Comeback album Aerial wasn’t exactly overburdened with obvious singles. Perhaps the beautiful, sunlit Somewhere in Between might have worked out of context of the Sea of Honey song-suite, but instead Bush plumped for a song that involved her impersonating Elvis and knowingly ruminating on the benefits of withdrawing from the public eye.There were a lot of songs about nuclear war around in the early 80s, but few as strange and bewitching as Breathing, written from the point of view of a fully sentient foetus. Five episodic minutes long, blessed with a gorgeous chorus and a spoken-word section describing a nuclear blast, it signalled that Bush had seized artistic control of her career.When the audience at one of her 2014 shows sang along to Cloudbusting, Bush was moved to exclaim: “Oh, what a lovely song!”, as if she hadn’t written it herself. She was right: powered by its string arrangement, Cloudbusting twists and turns dramatically, before reaching its final euphoric refrain.It says something about the sheer weirdness of The Dreaming that someone thought Sat in Your Lap was its most commercial track. Even in a pop climate where the Associates’ Party Fears Two could become a hit, this sounded thrillingly unhinged: three and a half minutes of screeching vocals, frantic PiL-influenced rhythms and Fairlight-driven sampling overload.Widely thought of as a disappointment, accompanied by a film she later described as “a load of old bollocks”, The Red Shoes LP nevertheless has its moments, not least its lead single: angular, life-affirming funk perhaps displaying the influence of Prince, who declared Bush his “favourite woman” and appeared elsewhere on the album.Subtly affecting, promoted with a supremely bizarre performance on German TV – involving a rubber-glove-sporting Bush sweeping the stage while dressed as a cleaner – Army Dreamers demonstrates the influence of folk music on her work. Its anti-war message is straightforward, but its eerie mood gets under your skin and into your bones like cold weather.Like a lot of Bush tracks, Hounds of Love looks faintly ridiculous on paper (the hook is provided by backing vocalists barking like dogs), but the reality is sublime. The moment when its mood of pregnant fear finally shifts into one of gleeful surrender – “don’t let me go, hold me down” – is one of the most jubilant in Bush’s catalogue.It’s hard to get across how extraordinary the swooping vocals and gothic romance of Wuthering Heights sounded on arrival, like nothing else in the pop landscape of the time, or indeed before it. Bush had to resort to tears to persuade her label to release it as her debut as an opening statement of iniduality, this takes some beating.Charged with the unpromising task of writing a song to order for the US romcom She’s Having a Baby, Bush came up with this: a sparse, moving meditation on loss, regret, female strength and male frailty. There’s almost nothing to it beyond her piano and her voice, which is all you need.Coming up with The Man With the Child in His Eyes – lushly melodic, at turns creepy and erotic, mysterious and alluring – would be an astonishing achievement at any age. The fact that Bush was 13 when she wrote it was perhaps the earliest sign she wasn’t just a singer-songwriter but an actual, no-further-questions genius.For all her hits, there is a sense in which Kate Bush is not a singles artist: you can’t really get a sense of the scope and depth of her albums via the singles taken from them. But if you were forced to choose one song that encapsulates her uniqueness, you should choose Running Up That Hill, a hit in 1985 and (remixed) in 2012, and a track that simultaneously functions as pop and something infinitely stranger. Its sound is ghostly and faintly sinister – an ominous cloud of synthesiser hangs in the background weird, garbled backing vocals crash in out of nowhere – but its chorus is exhilarating and euphoric. It draws the listener inexorably into its idiosyncratic world: pop music made by someone alive to the possibilities of what pop music can be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc5f17ece88884b0cc9ec9479da77bf4506c593d/0_279_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b100e3c05bfad404caf81d9c8c5fa8f1 1000w","title":"thank you consequence did alanis morissette invent wellbeing","story":"It’s twenty years since her Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album was released - a record full of Goop theories and other prophetic elementsAsk anyone to name an Alanis Morissette album and, unless they are wearing an Alanis Morissette T-shirt, they’ll say Jagged Little Pill. Why wouldn’t they? That 1995 classic shifted 33m copies globally, won five Grammys, redefined the word “ironic” and paved the way for a glut of copycat angst merchants (Meredith Brooks, where art thou?). But perhaps it is the album’s follow-up – the solipsistic, wellness-minded Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which turned 20 this month – that holds greater influence in 2018.While its predecessor boiled with a rage that was relatable to a broader audience still reeling from grunge’s blood letting, Supposed ... turned the anger and confusion inwards and processed it via healing trips to India (lead single Thank U, essentially a four-minute prelude to Elizabeth Gilbert’s 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love) therapy (The Couch) and, on Unsent, which takes the form of a letter, an emotional purging. So far, so Goop. As with Ariana Grande’s current ode to her exes Thank U, Next, Unsent picks over specific relationships: not with anger, more with a “you live, you learn” (!) self-possession. While some names were changed (the opening “Dear Matthew” was thought to reference Dave Matthews, whom Alanis dated briefly in 1998), its frankness still feels like a bold statement of owning, and alchemising, one’s apparent failures.When it came time for Katy Perry to follow up her multi-million-selling Teenage Dream album, she plumped for her own version of Supposed’s yoga-scented wellness. Prism (2013) mixed gap-year spiritualism with lyrics that could have come straight from Morissette’s diary (take Love Me’s “No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally”). Rather than just chucking out a facsimile of her commercial breakthrough, Morissette set a template for female artists to sidestep expectations and carve out more interesting careers as a result (see also Lana Del Rey’s Born to Die follow-up, Ultraviolence).With Alanis tired of being pigeonholed as a man-hater, Supposed … did away with limitations altogether. While in 2018, it is de rigueur to draw an album out past the 70-minute mark, 20 years ago that was close to commercial suicide. Across 17 sprawling songs, only Thank U approached a radio-friendly hit. Even that album title – a nod to people assuming her songwriting stemmed from one broken relationship – foreshadowed the likes of Fiona Apple’s 90-word When the Pawn ... and the 1975’s gleefully pretentious I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It. So, next time you are in the mood for a dose of Alanis Morissette, crack out the healing crystals and luxuriate in Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie’s gloriously unfashionable, yet decidedly evergreen, navel gazing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f4e42368dccde94bbb3644a9fc747a8891dfadf/0_0_1040_624/master/1040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57cc3810ffec88259f817a72655114d2","title":"married man justin bieber says he wants to be more like jesus","story":"‘First thanksgiving as a married man, first time hosting thanksgiving,’ Bieber says Justin Bieber marked his first Thanksgiving as a married man, saying that “love isn’t always easy” but adding he was trying, like Jesus Christ, to be more patient and selfless.The Canadian pop singer, 24, who married model Hailey Baldwin in a hush-hush civil ceremony in September, told his 102 million Instagram followers that Thursday’s US Thanksgiving holiday was the first he had hosted.“First thanksgiving as a married man, first time hosting thanksgiving,” Bieber wrote in a posting.Bieber and Baldwin both attend the evangelical Hillsong church, which was founded in Australia in 1983 and now has branches worldwide with a big youth following.Bieber found fame as a baby-faced 15 year-old but has had repeated run-ins with the law during a tumultuous reign as one of pop’s biggest stars.

The prime minister would have to win over nearly an equivalent number of Labour rebels to get the final deal approved, a task considered sufficiently unlikely that May faced questions on Friday about whether she would resign if MPs voted against it.She repeatedly refused to rule out the option, telling a phone-in on BBC Radio 5 Live: “I’m not thinking about me. I’m thinking about getting a deal through that is good for the country. My focus is on getting this deal through.”The phone-in was the latest step in what has become a punishing media blitz as May and other senior ministers try to sell the deal directly to the public – many of whom are weary of the Brexit debate – in the hope that a change in the national mood will pressurise MPs into supporting her.May is expected to announce details of the government’s post-Brexit migration plans in the run-up to the crucial vote, including lifting the cap on highly skilled “tier two” migrants such as doctors.Leaked cabinet papers obtained by the  suggest the government is also considering opening up a new route for low-skilled migration to ease the impact on the economy of the end of free movement. Proposals under discussion include 11-month work visas and a special category for 18-30-year-olds who want to work in the UK for up to two years.Senior government sources suggested that Downing Street had initially been sceptical about the need for lower-skilled migration routes, but was wary of alarming business groups.Most routes for low-skilled migrants will stop, and May is likely to sell this much more stringent regime as a vindication of her claim that her Brexit deal will end free movement. She has suggested that she believes the desire to control migration was a key rationale for the referendum result in 2016.The prime minister was criticised earlier this week when she told the CBI that EU migrants would no longer be able to “jump the queue”.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said in a live chat on Facebook that there would be a constitutional deadlock if parliament rejected the deal. “I think there would be a huge amount of worry by many people who just want the government to get on and deliver Brexit,” he said.May will meet the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Saturday before a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, at which the withdrawal agreement and political declaration are expected to be formally adopted after almost two years of negotiations.The deal will then have to be debated and voted on by British MPs in a “meaningful vote”, a step wrung from the government last year during the passage of Brexit legislation.The government is likely to announce the date of the vote on Monday, though it is expected to be in the first two weeks of December.Downing Street has launched a “Brexit Facts” blog aimed at rebutting negative press coverage of the deal and May’s spokeswoman said on Friday: “You will see ministers engaging widely”.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will visit Belfast to appear at the annual conference of the Democratic Unionist party, whose 10 MPs refused to support the government on finance bills this week because they do not like May’s Brexit deal.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, warned on Friday that the party’s confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives which is propping up May’s administration would be at risk if the Brexit deal was passed.She told BBC Radio Ulster’s Inside Politics: “If she is successful in parliament, and there is no evidence that she is going to be successful, then of course we will have to revisit the confidence and supply agreement. That agreement was about giving national stability it was acting in the national interest and delivering on Brexit. If this is not going to deliver on Brexit then, of course, that brings us back to the situation of looking at the confidence and supply agreement, but we are not there yet and we are not going to jump ahead until we see what happens in parliament.”The leading Brexiter Boris Johnson, who has repeatedly criticised the deal, will also be appearing at the DUP conference. Allies of Johnson said the former foreign secretary intended to increase his criticism of May’s plan in the coming weeks, having repeatedly warned that it would lead to an unacceptable loss of UK sovereignty to the EU.In a sign that May is prepared to deploy her powers of patronage to help get the deal through, it was announced that the Conservative backbencher John Hayes would receive a knighthood. Hayes is a Brexiter, but has not submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister or publicly declared whether he would support her deal.Despite the level of opposition in parliament, May suggested MPs could change their mind if they listened to the electorate. “In a sense, I think there’s two conversations going on at the moment,” she said. “In parliament there’s a lot of focus on who’s going to vote for the deal or not, and outside I think people are thinking: ‘Actually, let’s make sure we can get this through and get on with delivering’.”May played down the idea of no Brexit, which some ministers have begun to suggest is the most likely alternative to the deal, as the People’s Vote campaign wins the backing of a growing number of MPs. “Personally, there’s no question of no Brexit, because the government needs to deliver on what people voted for in the referendum in 2016,” she said.However, Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last week in protest at the withdrawal agreement, suggested that the government deal would be “even worse” than staying in the EU.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme what he would do if he had to choose between May’s deal or no deal, Raab said: “Well, I don’t have to choose that. I’m sorry, I’m not going to give way to hypothetical scenarios. I’ll keep fighting for the best, most successful Brexit.”In recent days, Brexit-backing ministers who have stayed in May’s cabinet have been less publicly supportive of the deal than remainers, such as Damian Hinds and Matt Hancock.Friends of Andrea Leadsom said she had no plans to campaign for the agreement and allies of Michael Gove suggested he would be willing to promote those aspects of the deal that cover his brief of fishing and farming, but not the wider package.Gove turned down the job of Brexit secretary last week after May rejected his suggestion that the withdrawal agreement be renegotiated to alter the terms of the Irish backstop.Meanwhile, Leadsom is keen for the government to consider a “no deal plus” if parliament votes against the deal. Under that plan, the government would pay the EU £20bn – less than half the planned orce payment – in exchange for a two-year transition period, during which the UK would prepare for operating on World Trade Organisation terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52143b8a752163cb3b90f9d3861b3ef4ab335e0e/0_59_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a95d1f27cfa8a1605517ac5d6e2b037","title":"hastings benefits desperation charities welfare advice","story":"As Amber Rudd takes over universal credit, advisers in her constituency tell of deep crisis“When we save this many lives, something is going very wrong with the welfare system,” says Jacky Everard. She and her staff are not nurses, doctors or counsellors, but their role, she says, is increasingly about easing desperate clients back from the brink of suicide.Everard, the chief executive of the Hastings Advice and Representation Centre (Harc), compiled a client report in the summer which found that, out of 100 clients surveyed, seven said they would have killed themselves without the charity’s help.The report is an upsetting read, Everard accepts, but she is also upset. She has been a social security benefits adviser for 40 years and never witnessed such despair and unremitting crisis.Everard’s staff are trained to help people claim benefits, but clients routinely arrive at Harc’s office in a converted church in a fragile mental state. Their distress is caused or made worse by a welfare system that bullies and humiliates them, and leaves them destitute, she says.Increasingly, the job of advisers is not just to sort out money or housing problems, but to offer clients hope and emotional support.Or, as Everard puts it, to light their path back from the edge. This is new. Six years ago, none of the clients they surveyed mentioned suicide.“That we need to save this many lives, keep this many people from total despair, is a perverse incentive of recent welfare reforms,” Everard wrote in the foreword to the survey. “No one should be pushed to the brink of suicide by the welfare system set up to support them in times of sickness and need.”Everard sent the report to her MP, Amber Rudd, in July. Last week, Rudd became work and pensions secretary following the resignation of Esther McVey, and she is now in charge of the benefits system. Hastings, says Everard, is a good place to find out exactly what is going wrong with welfare.Located on the south-east coast of England, Hastings is a mix of faded Victorian elegance and grim poverty. There is some affluence, driven in part by “down from London” arrivals who are helping fuel a thriving cultural scene. But there is also extreme deprivation. Unemployment is high. Housing insecurity and homelessness is endemic, and rough sleeping is rising.One of Rudd’s first acts as work and pensions secretary was to acknowledge there were problems with universal credit, which has been eight years in the making and is six years behind schedule. Her mission, she said, was to fix it and deliver a “fair, compassionate and efficient” benefits system.That is easier said than done. Tracy Maietta, 40, describes being trapped in an endless cycle of assessments to qualify for personal independence payments, a benefit awarded to help chronically ill and disabled people meet the extra costs of living, as “hell”.Maietta, a former housing officer, had to retire when a cluster of health conditions made work impossible. Despite a 500-page folder of medical evidence attesting to her incapacity, the private assessors hired by the Department for Work and Pensions repeatedly turned down her applications.She appealed successfully each time. “At the last tribunal, I put the 249 pills I have to take daily into a tub and held it up. I didn’t know how else to show them,” she says. Her experience has been one of indignity, humiliation and endless hostility. “I feel judged constantly. I’m not saying I want people to look after me, but I do want someone to show empathy,” she adds.Another Harc client, Laura, in her late 30s, fights back tears as she describes her experience of universal credit. A collapse put her in hospital, where she nearly died after contracting sepsis. Laura was a successful businesswoman before becoming ill. She is physically fragile and, to her bitter frustration, cannot work.What advice would she give Rudd? “There is no a simple tick-box solution. Remember we are human beings.”The leader of Hastings borough council, Peter Chowney, says universal credit austerity cuts have led to increased homelessness in the town. Chowney stood for Labour against Rudd in the 2017 general election. Her majority was 346. About 10,000 voters are expected to move on to universal credit from next year, he notes.Everard welcomed a report into UK poverty last week by the UN rapporteur Philip Alston, who described the “misery” of an increasingly remote and punitive benefits system. Rudd called his report “highly inappropriate”, but Everard disagrees. “He recognised our truth. What he said is happening,” she says.Maietta says the benefits system needs more than technical fixes and has to be more humane and understanding of people’s lives. “The people at the top don’t realise it isn’t working,” she says. “It’s just two separate worlds. They just do not live anywhere near our world. They don’t know what it is like to go to a food bank.”“Other benefits, such as personal independence payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs. PIP assessments are done with all available evidence provided by the claimant, including notes from their GP or health professional.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

The movement has no leader and its ad-hoc barricades at tollbooths, roundabouts and fuel depots have been organised on social media.The movement, which began as a protest against rising fuel taxes, has grown into a wider outpouring over inequality, a political class seen as cut off from reality and the pro-business Macron’s persistently negative image as a “president of the rich”.Marie, 31, a childminder in the Var region of southern France, has been protesting all week at a tollbooth “People are exasperated, there is so much anger – taxes are going up, our salaries aren’t. When you work hard, it feels unfair,” she said.“My retired parents can’t make ends meet so they had to get work distributing advertising leaflets. The government isn’t listening. To me, Macron is the president of the rich, slashing taxes for the wealthy, ignoring the rest of us. Politicians are cut off from our lives.“Those in charge are one big oligarchy. The media can’t be trusted either. I’d consider voting Marine Le Pen, but the whole political class is a letdown and I wonder why I vote at all. I worry the future will be even worse for my three children than it is for me.”Two people have been accidentally killed and more than 530 injured, 17 seriously, in a week of protests and roadblocks over what one 30-year-old factory worker who has been attending roadblocks in the south of France called “a broken society where we’re counting pennies to reach the end of the month, sick of politicians who don’t give a damn robbing the poor to give to the rich”.Macron, who has built his political identity on a refusal to back down in the face of public pressure or street protests, this week called for better “dialogue” to explain his policies.The centrist president has insisted his “transformation” of France through loosening labour laws and overhauling the workings of the welfare state would benefit ordinary French people, who have been through decades of mass unemployment.But he also promised the authorities would be “uncompromising” if protests degenerated into disorder. The government this week instructed police to break up the remaining roadblocks, particularly those around fuel depots and sites of strategic importance.Speaking about events on the island, as curfews were imposed in some areas to break up protests, Macron said: “We will be uncompromising because we can’t accept the things we’ve seen.”Dominique, 50, an unemployed technician at a roadblock in the town of Martigues, near Marseille, said: “It’s about much more than fuel. The government has left us with nothing.”“There are legitimate grievances that have to be given a hearing,” he told his cabinet on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afa3c36c7bb3bc59642a8fbe345c34f5bfd42a91/0_253_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19afadcbbfb78e61806aefefbb8c9896","title":"sapphic sensation the rise of the lesbian story on and off screen","story":"Creation and authentic depiction of same-sex relationships on film and TV goes mainstreamThe latest TV show to make waves online and ripples around office water coolers, Julia Davis’s Sally4Ever, features an explicit lesbian sex scene in its opening episode. In Killing Eve, Jodie Comer, playing a contract killer, tells Sandra Oh, a UK intelligence officer: “I masturbate about you a lot.”And there is more more same-sex screen time around the corner. Disobedience, in cinemas at the end of the month, adapts Naomi Alderman’s novel about the affair between two women from a frum (pious) Jewish community, played by Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams. Later in the year, Kristen Stewart and Chloe Sevingny co-star in Lizzie, described by one reviewer as “the classiest lesbian axe murderer movie ever”. Keira Knightley plays Colette, in the forthcoming eponymous biopic of the queer writer. Chanya Button directs Vita and Virginia, which tells the story of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf’s love affair. Olivia Colman, currently filming as Elizabeth II in The Crown, portrays a different, fictional queen in next year’s comedy The Favourite. She has called sex scenes with co-star Emma Stone “awfully fun”.Why have our screens suddenly become so Sapphic? And, actually, is it sudden? Empire’s editor-in-chief, Terri White, says that in cinema, “what’s most exciting is that we’re starting to see the green shoots of representation outside of just indies, which have always done the majority of the legwork, into, if not blockbusters, then films with a broader base, big-name Hollywood talent and award contenders.”There has also been a rise in the number of gay women in both the television and film industries: writing, directing, producing, which has the effect of avoiding the male-gaze criticism faced by Abdellatif Kechiche’s direction and writing of 2013’s Blue is the Warmest Colour (but which was widely acclaimed as a breakthrough for lesbian cinema).Hollywood’s current power-player producer is Megan Ellison (Zero Dark Thirty, Her). Cindy Holland is the hugely influential vice-president of Netflix’s original content. The online channel has just commissioned a show by Charlie Covell, (writer of the The End of the Fucking World), to be executive produced by Nina Lederman. All are gay women. The Bisexual, recently shown on Channel 4, is Desiree Akhavan’s exploration of her own bisexuality. .Linda Riley, the publisher of the lesbian magazine Diva and a British director of the media monitoring group Glaad, says playing a cameo role in The Bisexual was a great experience because a majority of the cast and crew identified as LGBT. She is clear, however, that there is much more to be done on-screen.“I am not saying that lesbians have to play lesbian roles, that’s like saying a policeman has to play a policeman, but these roles are rare and there are some incredible lesbian and bisexual actresses out there that it has to be a consideration now.”Audiences have increasingly responded positively to queer women played by actors both straight and queer, with the straight Lea Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos particularly praised. Aisling Bea, who played a lesbian character in ITV’s The Town, has told me she would be happy to do so again, and Cate Blanchett won an Academy award for her portrayal of Carol in the eponymous lesbian romance, in 2016.Screen portrayals of queer women have undoubtedly evolved: in the US, Netflix’s Orange is The New Black was praised for its authentic depiction, as was – initially at least – Amazon’s Transparent, which also features multiple female same-sex relationships. White points out that many movies no longer just “reflect the pain and struggle of same-sex female - and female-identifying - relationships but the humour, the joy, hell, even the mundanity”.The industry is learning that audiences are willing to watch erse stories, whether this be the mega-success of Moonlight, Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians or catering to the LGBT “pink pound” (apparently worth £6bn in the UK alone), when one in 50 UK people identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual.Riley, however, would hesitate to believe the cameras have stopped rolling on all stereotypes. “Lizzie, Killing Eve and Sally4Ever all feature lesbian psychopaths or serial killer – a typical lesbian trope.”She does mention that queer women have at least moved from “cypher characters to lesbian-specific storylines”, citing the love life of Coronation Street’s Sophie Webster. There is also Emmerdale’s Charity and Vanessa hook-up, a storyline which kept viewers guessing about their future together. Soaps have certainly moved on from the the early 90s scandal when Anna Friel shared a passionate lesbian kiss on Brookside. (This is often mistakenly cited as the first lesbian kiss on UK television – that was in the BBC show Girl in 1974).Friel, who has said she spent years defined by that kiss, “turning down other lesbian roles because it felt like going back to Beth”, is now back in her first lesbian role since then, in The Girlfriend Experience (Amazon Prime).White says 2018 will be remembered as a significant year for female same-sex relations on screen.The Favourite will be released on New Year’s Day and Killing Eve, which pulled in audience figures of more than 8 million, has been commissioned for a second series. In the first series, Comer’s character Villanelle tells an ex-girlfriend: “The best sex we ever had was on that chair.” Seems there will be plenty more to come."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Several in the organisation who had sex abuse complaints made against them are in prison\u0026lsquoFarmers ready to roll up their sleeves on climate action\u0026rsquoThirty-five years ago, Republican gunmen massacred worshippers at a church in Darkley, Co ArmaghIMO says release of earnings figures are \u0026lsquomisleading and unhelpful\u0026rsquoPhilip Hammond and Liam Fox visit fails to soften DUP stance on withdrawal agreementVictim blaming and flawed legislation is contributed to \u0026lsquounderreporting\u0026rsquo of sex assaultsLiam O\u0026rsquoConnell who played role in rescue of 30 students was found with drugs worth \u0026euro270,000Friends and colleagues gather in Trinity College to celebrate the life of John CurranIrish embassy and Department of Justice encourage family to re-apply after visa appeal refusedRegulations will bring gambling service providers within scope of anti-money laundering lawSacristan had eye gouged when he tried to stop David O\u0026rsquoDonovan (41) stealing church collection boxHEA chief resigned this year amid frustration over Department \u0026lsquomicro-managing\u0026rsquoFather had attempted suicide after hearing of Garda investigation into his abuseTransition from fossil fuels may have \u0026lsquodevastating\u0026rsquo implications for some workersLabour\u0026rsquos Conor McGinn will not support draft agreement as \u0026lsquoit is bad for St Helens\u0026rsquoNational Homeless and Housing Coalition call on \u0026lsquoas many people as possible\u0026rsquo to joinVaradkar says money will facilitate all parts of Ireland to share in State\u0026rsquos prosperity32 motorists prosecuted for dangerous driving between Junctions 8 and 11 on the M7Man who was nine when abuse started reported incidents in 2015 after sister sought access to his sonBrenda O\u0026rsquoConnell Barry uses acceptance speech to criticise the lack of State supports"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3707178.1542902558!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"xi jinping s power play leads from dusty caves to china supremacy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChinese president Xi Jinping spent seven years in Liangjiahe living in primitive conditions. Photograph: Mark R. CristinoEPAIn the cave in Liangjiahe where the 15-year-old Xi Jinping was sent in 1969 during the ravages of the Cultural Revolution, there is a felt mattress on a traditional heated bed known as a kang, propaganda posters, books, vacuum flasks and not much else.China’s future president spent seven years here in this desolate part of Sha’anxi province, living in primitive conditions, working the fields, digging wells and reading widely at night.Liangjiahe is such a bleak outpost it is difficult to imagine how the young Xi went from this cave of political exile to the Great Hall of the People nearly four decades later, when the Communist Party elite abolished presidential term limits to allow him to rule indefinitely and become the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.Born in Beijing in June 1953, Xi was the son of the revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun, a founder of the Communist Party who had been a vice-premier in the 1950s.During the Cultural Revolution – a 10-year purge of “impure” elements of Chinese society up to Mao’s death in 1976 – the young Xi’s family suffered terribly. Xi Zhongxun was demoted to running a tractor factory, even though he had been a close ally of Mao. Xi’s elder half-sister Xi Heping died, most likely by suicide.Xi Jinping was sent to Liangjiahe as part of Mao’s “Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside” policy. He escaped several times and was punished by Red Guards, while his mother, Qi Xin, was forced to denounce her son.Despite his treatment during the Cultural Revolution, Xi did not turn on the party. Instead, he harnessed the chaos and hardship of those seven years and channelled them into his ascent to the supreme leadership.Throughout the country, people volunteer praise for him and it is clear that he is popular. “Xi Jinping’s logic is that everyone can live together. He cares about the people. It’s like\u0026nbspt\u0027ai chi, harmonious and disciplined,” says one party scholar.T\u0027ai chi is about exercise and health, but it has a martial arts element. During his ascent to power, Xi has seen off hostile factions, clearing his way to the top by removing formidable rivals such as one-time rising star Bo Xilai, former security chief Zhou Yongkang and one-time Politburo member Sun Zhengcai.There are several pictures of Xi on the cave walls from his time in Liangjiahe. Though the younger face is thinner, the determined expression characteristic of Xi today was noticeable even then. Xi has always said he “left his heart” in Liangjiahe, and it’s here that his strongman tactics began to take shape.On one cave wall, in a foretaste of the current tensions between China and the US over trade, is a poster showing two giant fists crushing US presidents Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower as well as a gang of revisionists from China’s then-rival, the Soviet Union.“All countries who are against us are pests and enemies and must be cleared out,” reads the slogan, from a poem by Mao.Xi’s approach to leading China constitutes a sharp break from that of the previous administration under president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao, who seemed content to have technocrat status and focused on building the economy.After serving time as party leader in Hebei, Fujian and Shanghai, among other places, Xi finally reached the peak of power in November 2012 and currently occupies the three most senior positions in China:\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the Communist Party, president and head of the military.The vote in the Great Hall of the People last March, removing presidential term limits and enabling Xi to govern indefinitely, ended the system of collective leadership and succession introduced by former leader Deng Xiaoping after the death of Mao, with the aim of eliminating a cult of personality.The party scholar, who requested anonymity, says she believes that westerners are too hung up on the abolition of the time limit. “If we obey time limits and don’t get the best leader, then what is the point? Westerners think one, two, three, but we Chinese are happy to go one, three, then two if we get the best leader,” she says.Xi has cemented his grip on power by capitalising on public discontent about rampant corruption to punish more than 1.5 million officials, both senior “tigers” and junior “flies”. He has overseen a tightening of control and has increased pressure on dissenting voices, jailing human rights lawyers and cracking down on dissent in civil society, the media and the internet.Alexander Dukalskis, assistant professor at the school of politics and international relations at University College Dublin\u0026nbspbelieves Xi’s chief aim is for China to attain national greatness and to be respected on the international stage.“Consolidating power domestically provides the foundation to do so. When China is weak or ided internally it is not possible for it to exert as much influence internationally,” says Dukalskis.There is no inherent contradiction in Xi’s flexibility in espousing globalism and capitalism while preaching a Marxist message – China has been doing it for many years.Xi has overseen the development of a wide-ranging security state, which has seen more and more police and paramilitary security officials on the streets of all of China’s cities, and the development of all-seeing surveillance systems.At one regional university, over a holiday period, a group of classmates exchanged messages on the social network WeChat, including remarks critical of government policy. On their return to university, they were brought in by police, and their teachers had to intervene on their behalf. They were told they were banned from ever working in government.Xi has built a “Great Wall of Steel” around the restive western province of Xinjiang, where the United Nations says hundreds of thousands of Muslims are being kept in re-education camps, described by Beijing as “vocational centres” to wean young people away from extremist violence.In Hong Kong, promised a high degree of autonomy under the Basic Law governing the territory since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, Xi has warned democracy advocates not to cross a “red line” and undermine Beijing’s authority. “One consistent element of Xi’s tenure has been a scepticism of ‘western’ political ideas,” says Dukalskis.China’s burgeoning economy has given it influence, but Xi has added a political dimension to the mix. By espousing globalism in the face of growing US protectionism, he has positioned China as an alternative to the US, a stance that has proven popular with countries in Africa and Latin America.Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute, part of the University of\u0026nbspLondon, believes that by emphasising Marxist-Leninist values and centralising state agencies, Xi and the party aim to control the economy and everything else.“But this will also mean that the party will have to get its policies right in order to avoid major problems developing. Muddling through as an option is being eroded as this process deepens,” says Tsang. “Xi believes in the superiority of the socialist system and only tolerated the capitalist bits to enable China to return to socialism with Chinese characteristics.”This could signal trouble if he undermines the dynamic private sector while building up the public sector.Back in Liangjiahe, in Xi’s cave quarters a display shows the books he read during his time there. As well as the usual Karl Marx tracts, there is Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea and Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.The Communist Party has always loved a struggle narrative, and Xi has proven adept at embracing this legacy to serve his image of man of the people, driven by ideology but also patriotism – and his reputation as a man who succeeded in making the long journey from a dusty cave to the core of the constitution."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3708621.1543007237!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders set to adopt brexit withdrawal treaty","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May will be in Brussels on Saturday to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council  president Donald Tusk. Photograph: Will OliverBloombergAmid intense political and diplomatic activity ahead of Sunday’s crucial European summit, British prime minister Theresa May travels to Brussels on Saturday to finalise the agreements on which she has staked her political future and the relationship between the European Union and the UK.Senior political and official sources in Dublin and Brussels said on Friday night that they expected the summit to adopt both the withdrawal treaty – the legally binding document that will govern the UK’s exit if ratified by the European and British parliaments – and the declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.On Friday, at a meeting in Brussels of the “sherpas” – the personal representatives of the national leaders – the texts of both agreements were regarded as settled, according to authoritative sources.A Spanish threat to derail the summit appeared to have been averted by agreement among officials to language which reaffirms Madrid’s veto over future UK-EU talks impinging on Gibraltar.The sherpas agreed to a clarification statement by the 27 remaining EU states, which will not be part of the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration, though initial responses in Madrid were sceptical. But no more than Mrs May, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez will not be allowed by his fellow EU leaders to reopen the agreed treaty text, Brussels sources said.Mrs May will be in Brussels on Saturday to meet the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the president of the Council – the group of EU leaders that meets on Sunday – Donald Tusk.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at a meeting in Sligo that his expectation was that the EU would be able to sign off on the withdrawal agreement on Sunday. He said there was an issue in relation to Spain “but I am confident that can be worked out”.Mr Varadkar also spoke to Mr Juncker on Friday to inform him that the Dáil had approved the withdrawal agreement and that the Government was happy with the text of the future relationship declaration.Mr Varadkar told reporters in Sligo that if the withdrawal treaty was approved, it would ensure that “there won’t be any changes at all for these two years, if not longer, giving businesses time to prepare and also gives us time to negotiate a future relationship”.The Taoiseach said that lots of people “may be criticising this but I don’t see anyone putting anything better on the table”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also spoke to new British Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay by phone on Friday.In Northern Ireland, the DUP’s party conference will be addressed on Saturday by arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who will urge the party to maintain its opposition to the withdrawal treaty when it comes before the House of Commons for a vote in the coming weeks. On Friday night the British chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond addressed a party dinner appealing for support for the deal. But on Saturday DUP leaders will again stress their opposition, warning Mrs May that DUP support for her government was in question if she continued with the present deal.Several sources said that with the treaty and declaration texts agreed, EU leaders would seek to assist Mrs May when they meet in Brussels on Sunday morning. “They’ll avoid any triumphalism, avoid a long meeting – just get the business done,” said one source.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: BBC NewsPA WireTheresa May has refused to rule out resigning as prime minister if MPs reject her Brexit deal, raising the stakes ahead of a summit in Brussels on Sunday where European Union leaders are expected to approve it. Asked three times during a BBC phone-in on Friday, the prime minister repeatedly declined to say she would carry on in Number 10 if the deal is voted down in parliament.“I am focused on ensuring we get this deal. I believe it’s the right deal for the UK. As I’m sitting here I am not thinking about me but getting a deal for this country. That’s what drives me,” she said.“I am going to be around the country, explaining the deal up and down the country. I think this is important. It’s not just about MPs it’s about people understanding what the country is about.”\u0026nbspMore than 80 Conservative backbenchers have indicated that they could vote against the deal, as have the DUP’s 10 MPs who want the prime minister to scrap the Northern Ireland backstop. Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last week, said Mrs May’s proposals were worse than remaining in the EU.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU. But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that,” he told the BBC.The prime minister said he believed her deal was a good one for Britain and that it ensured that the country’s future would be in its own hands. She said that if MPs rejected the deal in a “meaningful vote” next month, there would be little point in returning to Brussels seeking to renegotiate it. “I don’t think they will come to us and say we’ll get a better deal. I’m making sure we get this through parliament. If we don’t, what we will see is more ision and uncertainty. My focus, all my focus, is getting . . . we’ve got to finalise the deal on Sunday but beyond that it’s getting the vote through,” she said.Mrs May said she would travel around Britain in the coming weeks to take her case for the Brexit deal directly to the people beyond Westminster. Downing Street is working to persuade MPs at Westminster too and some reacted cynically to the news that John Hayes, a Brexiteer who is backing the deal, is to be knighted.Downing Street dismissed speculation that, if the deal is voted down next month, MPs could be asked to vote again as the United States Congress did 10 years ago on the Tarp bank rescue deal, which passed on the second vote. Mrs May declined to say what her Plan B is if the deal is rejected, describing her job as persuading people it is a good deal.\u0026nbsp“The job of an MP is to say to themselves: ‘Does this deliver on what people voted for?’ And I believe it does deliver . . . this should be at the forefront of people’s minds,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3708413.1542994879!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"america letter higher voter turnout boding well for democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tElection workers examine ballots during a hand recount of votes in the US Senate race in Palm Beach County, November 16th, 2018. Photograph:  Michele Eve SandbergAFPGetty More than two weeks after the US midterm elections, a final result has yet to emerge as a handful of House races remain to be counted.But as Americans digest the results this Thanksgiving weekend, there is plenty of food for thought as the country looks ahead to 2020.While the election may have presented a split picture and a somewhat gloomy reflection on the polarisation that has become entrenched in American society, it was a good day for democracy. More people voted in the midterm elections than any non-presidential election since 1914. \u0026nbspA total of 49.2 per cent of eligible voters cast their ballot – this compares to a turnout of 36.4 per cent in the midterms of 2014. Though still low by international standards, this uptick in political participation is a positive sign.Most of this surge in voter engagement reflected a higher turnout by Democratic voters. In the House of Representatives race – where they flipped at least 39 seats – the Democrats outpaced Republicans significantly. More than 60 million people voted for Democrats in the House race. This compares to about 45 million for Republicans in 2010 when the party wrested control of the House of Representatives following a backlash against Obamacare. The level of support achieved by the Democrats is impressive – particularly as it is close to the 63 million votes Donald Trump received in the 2016 presidential election.But while the Democrats surged ahead in the popular vote once again, that did not necessarily translate into electoral wins.Democrats won reliably Democratic seats by large margins, though they failed to win House seats in conservative states such as Idaho or Montana for example. Democratic gains in Republican-leaning suburbs around the country were significant, however, and a real concern for Republicans going into 2020.On the Senate side, the picture was equally skewed – Democratic candidates garnered 12 million more votes than Republicans in Senate races though the party still managed to lose some seats. The apparent discrepancy again puts the spotlight on the Senate electoral process. Republicans continue to benefit from a structural advantage that the Senate system gives to conservative-leaning rural states. Under America’s electoral system, each of the 50 states gets two senators, regardless of population. Consequently, California, with a population of more than 40 million, has the same representation in the Senate as Wyoming, with a population of just over half a million.While defenders of the system argue that the Senate was never supposed to truly represent the popular vote, but rather give a voice to states, the political hue of the Senate has implications far beyond parliamentary democracy.In particular, the Senate plays a direct role in electing judges to the supreme court and to federal courts, a system that has resulted in a more conservative-leaning supreme court than the political dispensation of the population as a whole as indicated by the popular vote.While there appears to be little appetite within the US to change the system, Democrats have long taken solace from demographic changes which are expected to help their party in the long term.Population shifts and the increasing ersification of American society suggest that the political map is changing in their favour. The Democrats may not have been able to break the “red wall” of vast swathes of Republican-leaning rural America, but they are already making inroads into once reliably Republican states such as Arizona, Nevada and even Texas as the population of those states becomes more erse.This month’s election also delivered positive outcomes for Democrats looking to address the problem of voter representation. Several states included on their ballots proposals to change local election law. Voters in Michigan, for example, voted by two to one to loosen voter requirements, including moves to allow same-day voter registration, the expansion of absentee voting and the reintroduction of “straight” party voting, which allows voters to vote for one party for all positions by just checking one box – a long-standing process in Michigan that was abolished by the Republican-led legislature in 2015.In Florida, voters backed an amendment to allow felons to vote, with some exceptions – a move that will restore voting rights to more than one million people.In an election that was also notable for unsubstantiated allegations by President Donald Trump of voter fraud, moves to ensure that all US citizens who are entitled to vote can do so are a welcome development. Whether it will help the Democrats electorally will be a central question for the party as it heads into the next election cycle. \u0026nbspDemocrats take back the House.

I have the report, they have not concluded, I don’t know if anyone’s going to be able to conclude the crown prince did it,” he said. “But whether he did or whether he didn’t, he denies it vehemently. His father denies it, the king, vehemently.”Asked who should be held accountable for Khashoggi’s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Mr Trump replied: “Maybe the world should be held accountable, because the world is a vicious place.”Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu became the latest figure to criticise Mr Trump’s comments, claiming on Friday that the US president was willing to “turn a blind eye” to the issue.But in a sign of the growing international pressure being brought to bear on the Saudi regime, several European countries have halted the sale of weapons to the kingdom. Denmark, Germany the Netherlands and Finland have all imposed an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia over the war in Yemen. However, Britain has not halted arms sales to the kingdom, which remains a military ally of both the UK and US.Earlier this week, humanitarian organisation Save the Children said 85,000 children had starved to death in Yemen since the outbreak of war in 2015.Saudi Arabia, under Mohammed bin Salman, has launched an offensive against Houthi rebels in the north of the state. The United Nations’ envoy to Yemen arrived in the city of Hodeidah on Friday, in a bid to restart peace talks.Both Mr Trump and the Saudi crown prince are due to attend the G20 summit in Argentina next week. It is not clear if the US president will meet the Saudi prince.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia on Friday dismissed reports from Amnesty and Human Rights Watch which claim that the kingdom has tortured and abused several activists who have been detained without charge since May. The government said the reports were “baseless” and based on anonymous sources."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

urged pull adverts tech giants hosting extremism","story":"Police and emergency services respond to Manchester Arena terror attackBusinesses have been urged to pull their advertising from tech firms that fail to take down extremist content following an investigation into five terror attacks that claimed 36 lives.The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said social media firms’ and messaging apps’ continued refusal to remove extremist material meant it was time to hit their “bottom line” by persuading businesses to boycott them.It said the Government should take a lead role in persuading companies to follow the example of Unilever which has announced it is considering withdrawing its advertising from firms like Facebook and Google for failing to act responsibly.Last night, however, Sajid Javid, the home secretary refused to immediately endorse a boycott, saying he would respond to the committee “in due course.”Instead, he pointed to proposed new laws that would allow terror threats to be disrupted earlier and to curb online extremism through new offences of viewing or streaming extremist material.2005 - 2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to

He was first pictured on social media by a fellow pupil with the message: “How’s there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?”Other pictures apparently from the man’s Facebook account showed him with a moustache, facial stubble and drinking from a bottle of beer.Some parents were so concerned that they removed their children from school. The scandal prompted the school to remove the man, believed to be 6ft 1ins tall.Stoke High School in Ipswich, SuffolkAlthough the Home Office refused to reveal what age he is now believed to be, it is understood from sources that he is being treated officially as an adult asylum seeker.A department spokesman said: “We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.“Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an inidual\u0027s age with precision.In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.If an inidual is assessed to be under 18, but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case.A spokesman for the school, run by the Ormiston Academies Trust, confirmed the Year 11 pupil is no longer there, adding: “This is a matter for the Home Office. We cannot comment further on inidual cases.”A Facebook profile apparently by the man described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany. The account has since been deleted.Rumours had been rife in Ipswich that the man was even married and had children.Asylum seekers believed to be under 18 who arrive in Britain are entitled to a state education.However, if concerns are then raised that they may be older than initially thought, the school can report them to the Home Office, which then instruct social workers to make an assessment of their true age.However, they are only assessed as adults if there is clear and credible documentary evidence” or if two immigration officers rule that their physical appearance or demeanour very strongly suggests they are significantly over 18 years of age.The Home Office spokesman added: When there is doubt about an inidual\u0027s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority\u0027s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.If an inidual is assessed to be over 18, we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over 18 are assessed as adults.Please review our commenting policyAttenborough appeals for recovery of the lost Christmas Lectures20-minute flu test cuts NHS winter chaos and sends patients home earlySomerset farmer killed by his dog after it accidentally drove forklift truck towards him, inquest hearsDurham sweet shop raided as police fear confectionery is contaminated with \u0026#34dangerous drugs\u0026#34Meghan cookbook mosque linked to 19 terror suspects including \u0026#39Jihadi John\u0026#39 in group\u0026#39s investigation Army v Navy rugby match in doubt as drunken fans make Twickenham residents\u0026#39 lives a misery Why South Koreans are sending themselves to \u0026#39prison\u0026#39 Theresa May to curb low-skilled migration with announcement due on eve of crucial Brexit voteTuition fee cut will send universities into crisis, leading vice-Chancellors warnFraudsters who ran fake visa scam and stole £13m from HMRC sentenced to 31 years in jailBabes in the Wood murder suspect claims he was bullied by the \u0026#39downright nasty\u0026#39 policeHow people across the world reacted to the Black Friday deals Comment: As Mrs May goes flat out to sell her deal, here\u0026#39s why the backstop price is too highArmy chief Mark Carleton-Smith: Robots will never replace troops on the battlefieldRussia poses greater threat to Britain than Isil, says new Army chiefTech firms are acting \u0026#34indefensibly\u0026#34 by barring police access to terrorists\u0026#39  and criminals\u0026#39 data, says watchdog.Donald Trump asks Supreme Court to rule on transgender troop banPlan to use snipers to control parakeet population draws anger in SpainPakistan police arrest radical Islamic cleric who led Asia Bibi protestsUN raises \u0026#39alarm\u0026#39 as migrant deaths on crossing to Spain triple this yearWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/23/TELEMMGLPICT000181399392_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1wRt9OKUQdm3ozQDx50efXTVJoqefb4nODplG_f3HAY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside north korea hidden aid packages belie kim jong uns promise","story":"Cha Song-Chol, supervisor at North Korea\u0026#39s Children\u0026#39s Foodstuffs factory, which is playing a vital role in the effort to alleviate child malnutritionThe Children’s Foodstuffs factory in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, has a proud tradition of nourishing generations of the country’s children with its fresh and powdered milk and delicious soybean yogurt drinks.Every morning at 7am, dozens of delivery vans set out from its regional branches to deliver nutritional products to thousands of kindergartens.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe plummeting price of bitcoin in recent days has led to some cryptocurrency analysts joking that bitcoin has gone on sale, just in time for Black Friday.Bitcoin has fallen in price by around $2,000 over the last week, marking the latest losses in a turbulent year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.Bitcoin price just hit new 2018 low as analysts predict reversalNigel Green, founder and CEO of financial services firm deVere Goup, recently said the recent price crash has created a buyers’ market.“Savvy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money and, as such, they will be capitalising on the lower prices in order to build their portfolios and shore-up their positions,” Mr Green said.“Prices might fall further over the next few days, but we can expect a long-term upward trajectory for the crypto sector.”Some bitcoin exchanges are even offering bitcoin giveaways in an effort to entice people to their platforms.“Our mission is to make buying bitcoin quick and easy for everyone,” CoinCorner co-founder Danny Scott wrote in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent. “We are delighted to provide new cryptocurrency users with a fantastic offer that will give them a great first experience into the world of bitcoin.”Bitcoin payment processor BitPay, which has seen huge payment spikes on its network on Black Friday in previous years, has even gone so far as to release a song for this year’s event.Set to the tune of Rebecca Black’s ‘Friday’, lyrics include: “They don’t take cryptocurrency, they should take cryptocurrency, excuse me sir, what currency will you take?”The chorus concludes: “Everyone’s adopting bitcoin, don’t be a weirdo... They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That could allow Apple to put the phone back on sale at a lower price.Apple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingThe new handsets released in September were available at an increased price compared with previous years: the new iPhone XR, pitched as the more affordable model, begins at the same price the top-end phones had been marketed at until the iPhone X came along.Instead of buying those new phones, customers have been opting for the iPhone 8, according to numerous reports. Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Created with Sketch.The best films of 2018 (so far) Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession. Third, the poll tax, which was incredibly unpopular and became a direct threat to Tory MPs’ chances of holding on to their seats. But there was also the question of Europe.Created with Sketch.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlines Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track.

Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHOra\u0027s second album\u0026nbspPhoenix\u0026nbsphas received mostly positive reviews from critics. Reviewing for\u0026nbspThe Independent,\u0026nbspAlexandra Pollard said the record – Ora\u0027s first since her 2012 debut – was worth the wait and praised it for being surprisingly coherent, given the stuttering, protracted process it\u0027s been through to get here.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That\u0027s thanks to two little flying robots known as CubeSats – named WALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film – which went to Mars on the same rocket that is carrying the new lander and will fly past the Red Planet, relaying messages about its progress to\u0026nbspground controllers nearly 100 million miles away.Once the lander arrives on Mars, it will sit stationary and begin its work, looking deep underneath the surface for clues about what is going on there. Using seismometers to measure the movement of the ground, and a heat probe to take its temperature, scientists will get their first look at what is happening deep in Mars – and hopefully provide some clues about how it formed and more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien.

After gesturing that Reeves’s part would be very small, Allen went on to reiterate Woody voice actor Tom Hanks’s sentiment that the upcoming sequel would be very emotional, likening the final scene to Gone With the Wind.\u0026nbspToy Story 4 second teaser introduces new characters Ducky and Bunny“Hanks said it best — of course he always says stuff best — but the last scene of the movie I couldn’t even get through it,” he said.\u0026nbsp”I thought there were pages after it.

She can’t convince her party,\u0026nbspand even the CBI\u0026nbsphave privately\u0026nbsppanned her deal.“Dutifully they have trotted out their line on Monday but these emails show they don’t believe it by Thursday. Of course any deal is better than no deal, but both are bad deals.”Mr Raab, who quit the cabinet last week in protest at the Brexit deal, said the PM’s withdrawal proposals were worse than staying in the EU.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU,” he told\u0026nbspBBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England batsman Jonny Bairstow celebrates after reaching his century during Day One of the Third Test match against Sri Lanka at Sinhalese Sports Club in ColomboPrime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

She will also hold last minute-talks on Saturday with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.The prime minister\u0026nbspwas dealt a fresh blow ahead of the summit when Dominic Raab, who resigned as her Brexit secretary last week, said the\u0026nbspproposed exit deal was worse than remaining in the EU.Leave would win again if fresh Brexit referendum held – Diane AbbottDespite the growing backlash from her own backbenchers, the prime minister told a BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in that she remain determined to ensure the deal is approved by the Commons.\u0026nbspAsked whether she might resign\u0026nbspif the\u0026nbspplan is rejected, she said: “I’m focused on actually ensuring that we do get this deal through parliament, because I believe that this is absolutely the right deal for the UK.”Pushed\u0026nbspon whether she could resign, she added: “This isn’t about me. As I’m sitting here, I’m not thinking about me, I’m thinking about getting a deal through that delivers for the people\u0026nbspof this country. That’s what drives me and that is what’s at the forefront of my mind.”Asked for a third time if she might quit, she said simply: “My focus is on getting this deal through.”The prime minister also refused to say definitively\u0026nbspthat she believes her Brexit deal is\u0026nbspbetter for the UK than remaining in the EU.She said: “I honestly believe that I’m getting a good\u0026nbspdeal for\u0026nbspthe UK.“I recognise that there were aspects of being in the European Union that caused people\u0026nbspreal concern, and free movement was one of those.”Ms May said\u0026nbspthat, despite having campaigned for Remain, she “wasn’t one of those who said that if we leave the EU, it will be really bad for the UK –\u0026nbspI actually said the sky won’t fall in”.She said Brexit would create a “different world, but it will be a good one”, adding: “I genuinely believe\u0026nbspthere’s a bright future for this country and our best days lie ahead of us.”Created with Sketch.

You said ‘better\u0026nbspoff’ but actually it’s a different sort of environment and a different approach that we’ll be taking to things.”Asked again if her deal would be better than the status quo, she said: “It’s going to be different and I believe we can build a better future outside the European Union.”Earlier in the day, Mr Raab said MPs would “inevitably” vote down Ms May’s plan, which he claimed\u0026nbspwas worse than EU membership.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU.“But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that.”Ms May’s talks with Mr Juncker\u0026nbspare likely to focus on how the EU could help her sell the deal at home, but UK and EU leaders will also need to ensure it receives the backing of the 27 other\u0026nbspmember states.\u0026nbspThe Spanish government is threatening\u0026nbspto oppose the proposal unless changes are made in relation to\u0026nbspGibraltar.\u0026nbspUp to 80 Conservative MPs\u0026nbsphave also threatened to vote against Ms May’s proposed agreement when it is put before the Commons, casting doubts over her ability to get it through parliament.Some MPs believe she would then have to return to Brussels to negotiate a different deal.However, the prime minister warned her critics that the EU will not offer further concessions.She said: “If we were to go back to the European Union and say, ‘People didn’t like that deal, can we have another one?’ I don’t think they are going to come to us and say, ‘We will give you a better deal.’“This is the deal that I think works for the UK.”And she warned MPs that\u0026nbsprejecting\u0026nbspher plan would lead to more “uncertainty and ision” and insisted the public wants politicians to deliver Brexit.She said: “In parliament there’s a lot of focus on who’s going to vote for the deal or not, and outside I think people are thinking, ‘Actually, let’s make sure we can get this through and get on with delivering.’“If this deal doesn’t go through we are back at square one. What we end up with is more uncertainty and more ision.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It delivers on the vote of the referendum. It brings back control of our borders, our money and our laws.And it does so while protecting jobs, protecting our security and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom.She added: The British people want this to be settled. They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future. That deal is within our grasp and I am determined to deliver it.Empty House of Commons during the draft Brexit statement given by Theresa May (Image: Universal News And Sport (Europe))The political declaration - designed to form the basis of a new trade deal to be thrashed out after Britain quits the EU next year - promised an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership between Britain and the bloc.It said trade will be underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition while respecting the integrity of the Union\u0027s single market and customs union as well as the UK\u0027s internal market while confirming EU free movement for migrants to travel to the UK would end.The deal was signed off by the Cabinet in a hastily arranged conference call yesterday.A Downing Street source said: There was strong support for the declaration that has been negotiated. The Cabinet agreed it overall and on specific areas of ministerial responsibility.Dominic Raab, resigned as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union  (Image: Dan KitwoodGetty Images)Mrs May was given strong public backing from Home Secretary Sajid Javid last night. In an interview in Westminster\u0027s The House magazine, he said: \u0026ldquoI think that the draft agreement the Prime Minister has reached with our EU friends delivers on the referendum.The country made a clear decision, it delivered instructions to the politicians and we have to obey those instructions.\u0026ldquoWhat the Prime Minister has worked on is a deal that I believe delivers on that. It gives us back control of our laws, of our money and our borders.Reporting her deal to the Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs: The British people want Brexit to be settled they want a good deal that sets us on a course for a brighter future and they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.Britain is to quit the EU next year (Image: Chris RatcliffeBloomberg Getty Images)The deal that will enable us to do this is now within our grasp.In these crucial 72 hours ahead, I will do everything possible to deliver it for the British people.But in another gruelling question-and-answer session at the Commons dispatch box, the Prime Minister weathered a series of attacks from Tory heavyweights about the so-called Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Johnson, the former foreign secretary, told her the plan made a complete nonsense of Brexit.He said:\u0026nbsp We should junk forthwith the backstop, upon which the future economic partnership - according to this political declaration - is to be based, and which makes a complete nonsense of Brexit.Theresa May and EU Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab warned the deal would do the opposite of giving the country back control.The backstop ties the UK to the customs union and single market rules with no voice and an EU veto over our exit whilst paragraph 23 of the political declaration makes that the starting point for future relations to build on.The top reason people voted to leave the EU was to take back control over our laws. Isn\u0027t it the regrettable but inescapable reality that this deal gives even more away?Former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers said: The withdrawal agreement locks us in to paying the \u0026pound38 billion and also commits us to a backstop which has us obeying their rules and applying their customs rules without any say over them.                What is the withdrawal agreement? What is the political declaration?                Brexiteer leaves radio host speechless as he SHOUTS against May\u0027s dealIn her statement, the Prime Minister confirmed she had won concessions from the EU that will encourage high-tech customs checks to be used to try to prevent the need for a hard border as an alternative to the backstop.She acknowledged that Mr Duncan Smith and former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson had helped with ideas about the plan.But both former ministers told the Commons they could still not back the plan in its current form.Mr Duncan Smith urged her to strip out the backstop while Mr Paterson said the measure threatened the horror of Northern Ireland being split off.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, chief whip of Mrs May\u0027s parliamentary allies in the Democratic Unionist Party, called on the Prime Minister to dump the backstop and come forward with the alternatives set out in the political declaration instead.He said: If she wants to have the support of my party for the withdrawal agreement then we need to see an end to the backstop and those alternative arrangements put in place.Pro-Brussels Tories also attacked the deal, with some calling for a fresh referendum.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the political declaration as 26 pages of waffle.Theresa Villiers, former Northern Ireland Secretary (Image: Simon DawsonBloomberg via Getty Images)He said: The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with a backstop and no exit.It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.Tory whips were beginning the challenging task of trying to win over sceptical backbenchers last night.A senior Tory source said: We will be seeking to persuade all of our colleagues on the Conservative benches that this is a good deal for the country that delivers on the referendumLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the political declaration as 26 pages of waffle (Image: Jason AldenBloomberg via Getty Images)It takes back control of borders, money and laws and does that while protecting jobs and security.Tory Brexiteer MPs gave the Prime Minister an early taste of the opposition within her party to the deal within an hour of its publication.Senior Tory backbencher Sheryll Murray said: \u0026ldquoIn the EU referendum people voted to taken back control of our fish. Yet now the Prime Minister wants to commit us to stay in the Common Fisheries Policy in all but name.She seeks to enter a new fisheries agreement on access to waters and quota shares. Let\u0026rsquos be clear. This is a betrayal of Brexit.The Brexit draft (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel said: \u0026ldquoEverything the EU wanted from the negotiations has ended up in the Withdrawal Agreement \u0026ndash which is a legally enforceable international treaty.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore going to stay in the EU customs union, remain subject to judgments of the European Court, imperil our Union and allow the EU to have a veto over when we can leave the backstop.\u0026ldquoEverything the UK wanted has been put in an unenforceable, meaningless declaration.\u0026nbsp And it\u0026rsquos cost us \u0026pound39billion.\u0026ldquoThis is a costly surrender by the UK Government.Scottish Secretary David Mundell (Image: Jack TaylorGetty Images)Simon Clarke, another Eurosceptic Tory backbencher, said: \u0026ldquoThe political declaration is a well-meaning but ultimately meaningless set of words.\u0026ldquoAll the perils of the Withdrawal Agreement would bind the UK with the force of an international treaty.\u0026nbsp It will lock us into the EU customs union, subject us to the European Court\u0026rsquos judgments, threaten our union, give the EU the power to say when we can leave the backstop and cost the UK \u0026pound39billion.\u0026ldquoAnd anything we wanted from the negotiations has been trumpeted in a political declaration which has absolutely no legal effect on anyone.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis is a declaration of surrender by the UK Government.PM Theresa May declares that her Brexit deal is  (Image: Getty)Ranil Jayawardena, who quit as a ministerial aide last week in protest at the deal, said: \u0026ldquoThis isn\u0027t a settlement it\u0027s a surrender.\u0026ldquoInstead of taking back control, we will be abandoning control over vast swathes of our social and economic policy - and we will be simply unable to agree the trade deals of tomorrow with the rest of the world.This \u0027deal\u0027 stops us seizing the benefits of Brexit, whilst shackling us to the worst parts of the EU.\u0026ldquoThis is not a good and fair Brexit. It is not fair to the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in 2016, and isn\u0027t good enough for many who voted to remain either.

It is not expected to spark a full-fledged geomagnetic storm.\u0026ldquoHowever, polar auroras are likely when the solar wind arrives.While this storm is not expected to be overly powerful, the Met Office has warned that we will face a monumental solar storm in the future, which could knock out Britain\u0026rsquos technology and cost the UK almost \u0026pound16billion in damages.The country could be blunged into a blackout because it is not prepared enough for powerful solar storms, the Met Office told ministers.The weather forecaster believes the UK does not have sufficient infrastructure to prepare ourselves for such an event.A researcher from the Met Office said: \u0026ldquoWe find that for a one-in-100-year event, with no space weather forecasting capability, the gross domestic product loss to the United Kingdom could be as high as \u0026pound15.9bn.\u0026ldquoWith existing satellites nearing the end of their life, forecasting capability will decrease in coming years, so if no further investment takes place, critical infrastructure will become more vulnerable to space weather.

We would lose control of our laws. It is highly unlikely the economic partnership would be enforced, the EU knows this and they indeed have control over that process.What they really want is lock us in the same rules. We would have no voice, no control, over their formulation. We would have to kowtow to them. That\u0026rsquos a massive undermining of our competitive advantage.During the transition period, Britain will also have to follow all the European Union rules and European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is not how it works - the wrong policy means the wrong person.But he added: If there were a leadership election, which I hope there will be, I would not throw my hat into the ring as I fear it would be thrown back ‘Oddjob’ style.The ERG chair hinted he would end up supporting Boris, saying that Tory activists are enthusiastic about the prospect of the ex-Foreign Secretary taking power.Mr Rees-Mogg wrote: He certainly makes politics interesting and has the qualities of leadership.A week ago today, the leading Brexiteer announced he had sent a letter to backbench chief Sir Graham Brady calling for Mrs May to go.But the revelation failed to spark the expected cascade of letters which would have forced a vote of confidence in the PM.Last night, ERG member Nadine Dorries blasted her Brexiteer allies who failed to join the revolt against Mrs May.In a furious WhatsApp message leaked to the Guido Fawkes website, she wrote: There are a handful of you who have badly let the ERG down as a group, opening us up to ridicule and abuse in the media and online.I am referring to those MPs who have not put their letters in.It is being said that you have let the side down and are not the type of people anyone would want to go into battle with.The Brexiteer rebels are now pinning their hopes on a fresh push for a leadership challenge next month, after the PMs deal is voted on by MPs.BORIS Johnson earned almost £ a minute giving a speech to a finance firm in New York, it emerged last night.The former Foreign Secretary raked in a staggering £, for the two hour talk which comes on top of his £, a month salary for a Dailycolumn and his £, a year MP’s salary.He was addressing the US Golden Tree Asset Management firm in the Big Apple earlier this month.Mr Johnson also took in a £, donation for his office and staffing costs.And he pocketed a further £, in royalties from his books.The figures came from the MP’s official register of interests."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004512383321.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may woolly brexit deal","story":"But it is still just a woolly and even contradictory wishlist that barely binds Brussels to anything.The cost of these vague promises  Some  thousand million pounds.This “political declaration” about the future is predicated on Brussels negotiating a trade deal in good faith, a ­quality they have never shown since the referendum result they are even now desperate to overthrow.Why would their puerile desire to “punish” Britain abate once we nominally leave next March Especially when under the terms now agreed they can trap us in the Customs Union for ever The PM claims the EU wouldn’t want us there, benefiting from it for free, having ended free movement.

They have both failed to protect our children.Mr Newby kept his daughters away from the school after finding out about the pupil and only let themwhen he was certain the man was not going back.Sandy Martin, the Labour MP for Ipswich, said the Home Office “need to get their act together” to ensure adults cannot pose as children in the classroom.He said: “The Home Office needs to make sure that they are not sending people who are overage to school.“They have the means to do this and they need to do it. It doesn’t help the young people involved any more than it helps the schools.“I think the fact that it has had such a high profile in the news has made sure that the Home Office will do their job a bit better in the future, although the history of the Home Office doing its job a bit better isn’t very encouraging.”The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was “posing as a pupil” in her class.He said: “They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take,“I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.“The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies.“I explained that I was sorrythe pupil turned out to be a genuine -year-old, but that parents had a responsibility for the safeguarding of children in their care, as should the school.“The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.“He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve. My last words to him were, “You have not heard the last about this”.Pupils became suspicious when they saw that the clean shaven pupil appeared to have the shadow of a beard on his face.They then discovered the Facebook profile in his name which described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.The pictures on the now deleted profile showed him with a beard and drinking a bottle of beer on a street, and also included an image of another -year-old boyIt was also claimed that the pupil bombarded a -year-old girl classmate with text messages, prompting her to complain to safeguarding staff – because she was worried about his true age.But the girl was told that there was nothing “sinister” about the texts as they were not of a sexual nature. When shown the alleged Facebook picture of the pupil with a beard, the teacher allegedly said that people matured at dferent ages. She stopped receiving messages from him after she complained.A mother of another pupil said the man had told her son that he was aged  and was married with two children when he was askedhe wanted to join in a game of football at break time.A Home Office spokesperson said: “When there is doubt about an inidual’s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority’s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.“If an inidual is assessed to be over , we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.“In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adulttheir physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are signicantly over  years of age – and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.“The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over  are assessed as adults.”The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were “not attending the school” and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case.The school has not made any new statement and Suffolk County Council has also not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451333393.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"scrooge school christmas commercial","story":"Pupils at Lady Lumley’s School in Pickering, North Yorks., were told they must write to their RE teacher to plead for the celebration to be brought back.In an assembly this week, Father Christmas told students about the true meaning of Christmas being “lost and buried under an avalanche of commercialisation” before announcing the holiday was cancelled.Cards, gts and Christmas activities were banned unless persuasive arguments can be made to argue the real meaning of Christmas, he said.Children at the secondary school now have until November  to email their Religious Education teacher to persuade her the school should celebrate Christmas.Headteacher Richard Bramley said: “In assemblies this week, Mrs Paul, one of our teachers of RE, spoke about Christmas and whether the message of Christmas has been lost and buried under an avalanche of commercialisation.“Christmas is a day celebrating the birth of Jesus and should be a time of goodwill to all, yet it can be a very stressful, expensive, argumentative and lonely time.“Mrs Paul read out a letter from Father Christmas and cited the example of Christmas cards which bear no relation to the origin or meaning of Christmas but carry symbols we now recognise as associated with the holiday season, e.g Santa Claus who, in his modern incarnation, was probably invented by the Coca Cola company!The reception has been mixed among parents and students with the ban being taken badly by some.One parent tweeted: “I understand the way the RE teacher is trying to educate the kids.

But as in all animal farming, there will be the rare occasion when sicknesses or wounds etc. can occur.“Although responsible fur farmers are doing their best, it is possible that some of the thousands of production animals can suddenly fall ill. Four dead animals out of the , animals on the mink farm on the date of the secret filming equals .% mortality, which is below the typical figures in the production animal sector.”The statement claimed both farms involved had valid Finnish Standards certication and both farms have been inspected according to this certication programme.British MPs debated a ban on fur imports in Parliament in June after a petition garnered , signatures.In the end the government dismissed the idea, saying “national bans are less effective than working at an international level on animal-welfare standards”.Labour has pledged to ban fur imports and require real fur to be clearly labelled."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000421578862.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vladimir putin power launch nuke strikes plans russian parliament","story":"Senators have recommended tearing up the military doctrine banning initial use of weapons of mass destruction.It comes after the Russian president said Moscow would retaliatethe US withdrew from a landmark cold War missile treaty.Currently the doctrine prohibits first use unless Russia is threatened by weapons of mass destruction orits very existence is in jeopardy.But the revision would give Putin power to order strikes in response to enemy use of conventional weapons, reports The Times.Senators in the Federation Council propose that Russia should be allowed to hit back with nuke weaponsthe country is attacked by hypersonic and non-nuclear strategic weapons.The move comes after Donald Trump announced that the US plans to withdraw from Intermediate-Range Nuclear ForcesTreaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in .Russia and America have accused each other of violating the deal, with the matter expected to be discussed by Trump and Putin at a G meeting in Argentina.The Kremlin warned that the US decision would make the world “a more dangerous place”.The Times reported that Franz Klintsevich, a member of the council’s defence committee, said that eastern European countries hosting Nato military bases, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, “should understand that we won’t simply look at that through our fingers — we will react”.Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the council’s foreign committee, said that the US intention to withdraw from the treaty could lead to Russia deploying missiles banned by the pact “on the territories of our allies”.The move comes after the Pentagon updated its own nuclear policies by broadening the circumstances under which it would carry out nuclear strikes.Only last month, Putin told an international policy forum that Russia would only use its nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack on the country.He told the Valdai Club: “Our strategy of nuclear weapons use doesn’t envision a preemptive strike.Our concept is a launch under attack.

Love is a Gt has now hit the million view mark.All the feels around the nation! Thanks to everyone who is sharing out short film.A special film with a special message.Congratulations Phil Beastall on this achievement - this didnt happen by chance or sheer luck - this happened because you are a talented filmmaker and a wonderful storyteller.Good work deserves to be seen - you deserve this.And she added last night: Our no budget film seems to be receiving all the love and stealing some thunder!The nation has been left weeping this week after the film, shot in , resurfaced and reminded people of the true message of Christmas.Chris, who has since gone on to co-found COBA Digital, posted today: A short film I was a part of  years ago seems to have gained huge traction in the past hrs, created by the talented Phil Beastall - and although I’m pleased to say my appearance has changed for the better - the message is still as relevant now as it was then.Since the emotional tale went viral, Phil has been inundated with messages from fans who claim the video could have been used instead of the expensive Elton John-themed John Lewis advert.Others have suggested the store hire him to make their Christmas ad for .Among those welling up after viewing the ad was Good Morning Britain host Ben Shephard who admitted on todays show he couldnt watch it without crying.The young filmmaker told the show he got the moving idea for the film while on a run.He said: To be honest, it was just a last minute decision really. Im a bit of a kind of frustrated film maker and I wanted to get a Christmas film out there.It was just when I was on a run on a Sunday and I just came up with this idea and I just really wanted to create something that would resonate with people as I thought especially in todays society we kind of just need that reminder that we are not really defined by our careers and materialism, actually family does come first.So ultimately I just wanted to create something that was emotive and what resonated with people and maybe they would turn to their wives, husbands, kids whatever and give them a cuddle and say I love you.Phil, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said he was a fan of the John Lewis ad, but added: “People seem to like my film because it’s the story that shines through. You don’t always need a huge budget, just an impactful narrative that gets the message across.”Thousands of commentators praised the video online and admitted that it had reduced them to tears.Melanie Thomas wrote: In tears. I have no words except John Lewis, tell your advertising team they [are] sacked. “Stop plugging Elton Johns song and get this man to do your adverts.Lisa Darling said: Best advert ever, maybe John Lewis should pay him a million.The response was so overwhelming that Phil conceded defeat in trying to respond to all the comments because the video attracted so much attention.Most touchingly, Phil received messages of thanks from parents who have lost a child and also children whose parents are no longer alive because the video had a positive impact on them.Phil said: “A lot of people are saying how it has touched them and made them feel that they can cope a little bit more this Christmas, which is amazing.“I never expected that at all. To think people are getting so much from my film.“I am blown away.”Phil made the video in  but was inspired to share it again now after seeing the Elton John advert on TV.The John Lewis advert cost £million to make, a fortune compared to the small budget production Love is a Gt, which cost less than £.Professional videographer Phil dedicated the emotive and video to the selflessness of his partner of ten years Claire Higley, the mother of their children Ethan, Eliza and Zara.The man in the video has to finally let go of his mother on the most family-orientated of days and Phil wanted to celebrate the le that has rewarded him with his we and mother to his children.John Lewis declined to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000406141674-e1540908854709.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"benefits freeze state pension 2019","story":"From April Brits will see their benefit payments from the government frozen yet again, but the state pension will go up by £. a week from to £. - a £ boost.The Tories triple lock means that pensions have to rise in line with inflation, earnings growth of . per cent - whichever is highest.This year that was . per cent, measured through the average rise in wages.The old state pension will rise from £. to £..Brits on maternity pay will see a slight boost from £. a week to £..But for most Brits who are claiming any kind of benefits - including Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or Housing benefit, the rates will stay the same.The majority of working age benefits have been frozen at the   levels, meaning they wont get hiked in line with inflation.Ministers have faced calls to end the benefits freeze, with experts saying it will list , out of poverty.The Resolution Foundation said the continuing benefits freeze next year would leave low-income households more than £ a year worse off.Single parents could be as much as £ poorer.Adam Corlett, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “It is not too late to change course, end the freeze and ensure low and middle income families’ benefits keep pace with the rising cost of living.”Steve Webb, Director of Policy at Royal London said today there was now a huge gap between pensioners and working age adults.He blasted: Linking pensions and pension credit to earnings whilst freezing working age benefits yet again means that the minimum income for retired people is now roughly double that available to unemployed people under pension age.It is hard to think that these benefit rates are a fair reflection of the relative cost of living of the dferent groups’.Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Margaret Greenwood said today: This shows austerity is far from over.

People identied one of the guys.”Paul says he “knows a few people who know a few people”. A phone call was made to the villain saying: “Those tools need to be ed.”He adds: “Within the next day or two we got the tools back.”Around two weeks later police finally arrived to take a statement from Paul. He handed over the CCTV and the name of the criminal.He says: “The police said they had a major incident in Stockton on the day of my theft and just didn’t have the numbers. A few weeks later I got a message saying the case was closed. No further action would be taken.”He says he felt uneasy taking the law into his own hands, but adds: “Unfortunately, the police haven’t got the bodies to deal with this sort of crime, that’s why it’s on the rise.“Criminals realise the police’s response time is low. Partof my council tax is allocated to the police, but that wasn’t cut when Cleveland Police reduced their numbers by .”In Hartlepool’s Foggy Furze district, locals have welcomed the patrols by Stephen and eight other volunteers.Retired forklt truck driver David Dodds, , says: “I hope it’s a deterrent. The police should be doing it but I feel for the officers. It’s not their fault there’s not enough money.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that , crimes were recorded from the year to March.This means a rate of  crimes per , residents during  to  - above the England and Wales average of .Gun and kne possession offences rose from o to  incidents, while theft shot up by  per cent.The latest police figures also reveal the number of robberies between April  and March  more than doubled.There were  robberies - including violent muggings - in the period, which is an increase of . per cent in - when  were reported.Hartlepool also has the highest level of crime across the force area.At the nearby Ye Olde Durhams Social Club, supervisor Jacqui Hunter serves afternoon pints to mainly retirees from Hartlepool’s heavy industries. Drinkers here overwhelmingly welcome the community patrols.Mum-of-two Jacqui, , says: “We had cars broken into at am. We caught it on CCTV and called police. That was in March. We’re still waiting for police to pick up the CCTV footage. They give you a crime number, then you wait for weeks and nothing happens.”Retired toolmaker Dick Massey, , says: “I had the lead pinched from the canopy above my door three weeks ago. I went to the police station the next day.“I expected them to come and have a look but they didn’t. They just gave me a crime number. I’m not happy about it. I pay my taxes.“I asked them why you never see any police about now and they said, ‘We haven’t got the numbers’.“I’m not surprised people are organising their own patrols.”Co-ordinated via Facebook, the Foggy Furze Neighbourhood Patrol insist the “vigilante” tag they have been labelled with is wrong.Taxi driver Stephen, , says of his early-hours encounter this week: “If we were vigilantes we would have had them on the floor, face down, with our knees in their backs. We’re a deterrent. We called police and, to be fair, they arrived in five minutes. We gave them a description of the men but they’d gone.”Recorded crime in Hartlepool is up  per cent in a year. There were  robberies between April  and March , up more than  per cent on the previous year.Gun and kne possession offences rose from  to , while theft is up by  per cent.Hartlepool’s Labour MP Mike Hill has called an urgent meeting with police chiefs and described the recent instance of too few cops to answer Saturday night emergency calls as “unacceptable”.He tells The Sun: “I don’t condone vigilantism in any form and don’t see that as an issue in Hartlepool. But, clearly, we’re a step closer towards that unless we get funding to see more bobbies on Hartlepool’s streets.”Cleveland’s Chief Constable Mike Veale admits: “The service we are providing the public is nowhere near where it needs to be.”In a statement he says: “I would not be exhibiting the courage that my officers and staff deserveI continue to say we have enough resources,I continue with this commentary that things in policing are OK. They are not OK.“The cuts created and caused by austerity are too deep and have gone on for too long. My message is clear — give us the tools and we will do the job.” Since  police funding nationally has fallen  per cent and officer numbers by ,.Writing in The Sun this week, former Hartlepool Detective Superintendent Ray Mallon — nicknamed Robocop for his zero-tolerance approach that cut crime by  per cent — said that “simply giving police more money does not make them more effective”.He added that officers should be taken from specialist units such as CID and put back on the beat.Yet Chief Constable Veale’s broadside will resonate in Whitehall, where Home Secretary Sajid Javid last week promised a “fresh look” at police funding.But until the thin blue line becomes thicker in Foggy Furze, Stephen and his friends will be out protecting their neighbourhood."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004513656161.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bungle chow puppy released cops","story":"The puppy smothered his family with loving licks after being released from police custody.He then tore through the house with his owners’ other dogs, Newfoundlands Fluffy and Gigi, before settling down in front of the TV.Bungle was also greeted by Sun reporters dressed as TV favourites Zippy and George.Owners David and Susan Hayes and their -year-old son Joseph were relieved he was home after five days.Joseph said: “It must have been so awful for him but he looks ashe’s back to his old self already.”Five-month-old Bungle was taken away by police after he escaped from his home near Towcester, Northants, and nipped an officer.But he was ed within hours of The Sun campaigning for his release under the headline “I’m a silly puppy . . . get me out of here!”.Banker David, , said: “He was a bit dishevelled so he’ll need a good groom.

She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “The last thing we want is for Britain to be tied beyond .“The British people want us to get out. This is a sell-out.”Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said: “This is £billion for a pig in a poke.“The EU’s got nailed down everything it wants whilst leaving us on a half promise of what we want.”And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called it “ pages of waffle”.He said: “The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with backstop and no exit.“It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.”He accused the PM of producing a “blindfold Brexit from a government that spent more time negotiating with itself than for the nation”.In yesterday’s document, the EU agreed the UK can end free movement, try to negotiate deals with the rest of the world and take back control of fisheries.But the EU refused to accept that a future EU-UK trade deal will allow Mrs May “frictionless trade” and insisted the UK will be bound by EU rules on everything from state aid to climate change.And it only accepted that technology would be “considered” as a way of preventing theof a hard border in Irelanda future trade deal is not agreed.The terms will almost certainly be formally agreed by Mrs May and  other EU leaders at a crunch summit in Brussels on Sunday. This will trigger the orce bill of up to £billion.In a fierce Commons exchange, the PM resorted to urging MPs to back the deal when it goes before the Commons because the public is bored.She insisted “Brexit is within our grasp” adding: “The British people want Brexit to be settled.“They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future.“And they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.”She once more ruled out the prospect of a second referendum.And Downing Street insisted it will never happen “while she is Prime Minister”.But Brexiteers lined up to slam the agreement — fuelling concerns it will never make it through the Commons in a critical “Meaningful Vote” in three weeks’ time.More than  Tories are thought to be ready to vote down the deal — alongside the DUP, SNP and most Labour MPs.Cabinet ministers spent much of a conference call with Mrs May ­yesterday morning debating how to sell the deal to the nation.Last night Chief Whip Julian Smith emailed Tory MPs urging them to “unite” and back the PM. He told backbenchers: “If we reject this deal we go back to square one.“This would mean damaging uncertainty which will threaten jobs, investment and the economy.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid insisted the deal “delivers on the referendum” — although he admitted the Government must do a “better job of selling” it.But Boris Johnson said the terms of the Brexit deal made a “complete nonsense of Brexit”.And Brexiteers warned they could not support a deal which still included the so-called Irish backstop plan for keeping the border open.But Mrs May insisted it would only kick ina new trade deal isn’t in place by January .But it is still just a woolly and even contradictory wishlist that barely binds Brussels to anything.The cost of these vague promises Some  thousand million pounds.This “political declaration” about the future is predicated on Brussels negotiating a trade deal in good faith, a ­quality they have never shown since the referendum result they are even now desperate to overthrow.Why would their puerile desire to “punish” Britain abate once we nominally leave next March  Especially when under the terms now agreed they can trap us in the Customs Union for ever The PM claims the EU wouldn’t want us there, benefiting from it for free, having ended free movement. But that’s a price Brussels will surely pay to cripple us as a trading rival on their doorstep.That said, the deal is NOT all bad.Downing Street rightly trumpets that it ends free movement and our massive membership subscription, protects jobs and secures our fishing rights .And Mrs May, to her considerable credit, pushed the EU into an extraordinary U-turn over a high-tech solution to police the Irish border. Remember how glibly they once sneered at that idea Trouble is, who trusts them not to change heart againthe appalling “Irish backstop” alternative suits them The trade deal may take years. Anyone could veto it: Spain over Gibraltar. Or the Belgian Walloons who almost wrecked the EU Canada deal. We would be stuck.And while Mrs May’s deal enshrines our right to an independent trade policy, it also says any new partnership with the EU must “build on” a single customs territory. That’s why Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab quit — it ­scuppers any deals where.The one straw we clutch is that Jeremy Corbyn isn’t negotiating.

We want more and this isn’t enough.“It’s just the start of a new phase.

Theresa May is going to have to be more categorical.“We need it in writing, in black and white, not nice words from the dispatch box. If it looks like the CFP and sounds like the CFP then it’s the CFP.“I could never accept linking access to our fishing waters to any kind of future economic partnership.”Member States drew up the plan after conceding it’s too late to signicantly change the Political Declaration, which is a joint EU-UK document.The drive to toughen up the bloc’s stance on fishing is being spearheaded by France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Germany.EU countries’ original trade guidelines, from March, state: “In the overall context of the FTA, existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451433379-e1543009840420.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit deal arlene foster scrap tory deal","story":"Foster, , told BBC Radio Ulsters Inside Politics: If she is successful in Parliament, and there is no evidence that she is going to be successful in Parliament, then of course we will have to revisit the confidence and supply agreement.That agreement was about giving national stability, it was acting in the national interest and delivering on Brexit.If this is not going to deliver on Brexit then of course that brings us back to the situation of looking at the confidence and supply agreement, but we are not there yet and we are not going to jump ahead until we see what happens in Parliament.The Democratic Unionist Party effectively became kingmakers after the  general election thanks to the confidence and supply deal that was struck with the Conservative party to keep May in power.It means the DUPs ten MPs will vote with the Tories on key measures such as the Budget and any votes of no confidence that could topple the government.Founded by Protestant firebrand Ian Paisley, the DUP was once a fringe party but is now the largest in Northern Ireland, with a narrow electoral edge over republicans Sinn Fein.Led by Arlene Foster, they are staunchly pro-union and pro-Brexit.May has already found herself in hot water over the DUP when they recently went on strike during voting on the recent Finance Bill earlier this week.Their refusal to back the Government on the all-important money legislation is a clear breach of the confidence and supply agreement that cost taxpayers £billion.But senior DUP sources last night told The Sun the party would continue to stay away from Commons votes until Mrs May agrees to rip up her controversial Irish backstop.A senior DUP figure told The Sun at the time:  “I don’t think we’ll see much Government legislation tabled next week, as they know what we’ll do now.“They are breaking the agreement, not us.

So, while she addressed the Commons as Work and Pensions Secretary for the first time, the Mirror gave some of her battling constituents the chance to speak up themselves. None was more damning than widow Georgina Mitchell, , who is struggling under the new benefits system. She said: “I’d like to see Amber Rudd on the breadline. It’s not nice. No one wants to be living like this.” Another constituent, Max Monroe, was searching for somewhere to sleep. Max, , has been homeless since February after he lost his job and was moved from the old benefits sysshyshyshytem to Universal Credit.

Grim, but out of the rain. His story is a snapshot of austerity Britain. In Ms Rudd’s Hastings and Rye constituency, poverty and wealth are uncomfortable neighbours. And it is impossible to ignore the impact of Universal Credit, pushing the jobless on to the streets and forcing families to rely on food-banks. “When I was put on Universal Credit I couldn’t catch up with my rent,” Max tells me. “I had been working at Wickes and Wetherspoons before but after that there were no more jobs.   “I had a flat which I had to pay pound a month. I was soon pound short every month. It escalated so I went on the streets. I’d say Universal Credit was to blame.” Outside the local Jobcentre Plus, just up the hill from Max, I meet mum-of-one Carol Pentecost, , pushing her nine-month-old son Blake in a buggy. Carol is at least pound-a-month worse off since the roll-out of Universal Credit. “After I’ve paid the bills, there’s nothing left for food and nappies for Blake,” says Carol. “We have to get three bags of groceries from the food-bank. “Amber Rudd needs to stop Universal Credit. It’s making everything worse – a lot of the people we know are suicidal.”  A DWP spokesman said: “No one has to face hardship with Universal Credit and we recently announced a poundmillion partnership with Citizens Advice to help vulnerable people with claims.” However, homelessness is visible on almost every street in Hastings, where four rough sleepers died over the Christmas period at the start of this year. Chrissy Brand, of campaign group People’s Assembly Against Austerity in Hastings, said: “It’s bad enough for the local community having Amber Rudd as our out-of-touch and destructive MP.It’s positively dangerous for the country to have her as the Work and Pensions Secretary, months after she had to resign due to her part in the Windrush scandal which destroyed so many lives.   “She says Universal Credit has done great things for Hastings. Wrong, there has been an % rise in food-bank use here over the past year because of that.” Now it seems, Ms Rudd is oblivious to the national picture, after she dismissed a UN report into poverty in Britain.She said the language used in the damning investigation was “wholly inappropriate”.

Police say it would be impossible to defend against a terrorist with one of the . calibre or higher guns which can immobilise a vehicle or truck from a mile away. And the Government had the backing of the Labour Party to pass the ban through Parliament. But  MPs signed an amendment to reverse the ban, including members of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Groupof hard Brexit backbenchers.  The group said the ban was disproportionate, and laid out plans for a high-security process for people to obtain high-energy weapons. Yet they were also seeking the chance to prove they had the numbers in Parliament to block government legislation in the run up to the ‘meaningful vote’ on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.  Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin were among those supporting the amendment to the offensive weapons bill that would prevent a ban on rles that have a power of “over , joules at the muzzle.” It was also opposed by DUP MPs and Labour MP Kate Hoey.

Downing Street announced out of the blue this afternoon that John Hayes, a former minister, will become Sir John in a rare honour. The news, slipped out on a Friday afternoon, comes just weeks before Mrs May faces a vote that will make or break her Brexit deal - and her premiership. The meaningful vote in the House of Commons could come down to just a few wavering MPs. Sir John is a Brexiteer who last week demanded the Prime Minister look again at elements of her Brexit deal - and said he could not accept current plans for the Irish backstop.  He told Spalding Today last week: Whilst I can live with much of this agreement, I have been clear that we must look again at the transition arrangements and how they end. We simply cannot allow the European Union to, in effect, dictate when the transition period or the Irish backstop comes to an end. I remain hopeful that the Prime Minister will listen to representations from her party and from parliament that the deal that she has proposed needs the changes that I have described in order to be acceptable. Chris Matheson MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, said: It would be a spectacular act of desperation for Theresa May to be giving away knighthoods in a bid to win votes for her botched Brexit deal.” The former minister spent  years on the Tory frontbench, and previously would have had to resignhe voted against the deal. Since January he has been a back bencher and able to vote against the government with few consequences. But crucially he has not yet put in a no confidence letter against the PM, it was reported. Today the Prime Minister refused to rule out resigningher deal is voted down. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons.

He was askedthe PM had answered his question, and he replied bluntly: No. Eventually, pressed by the host, Theresa May insisted: We can build a better future outside the EU.

Theresa May refused to deny shell resignher Brexit deal is defeated in Parliament. The Prime Ministers deal is widely expected to be voted down in the House of Commons before Christmas. But confronted by host Emma Barnett, Mrs May failed three times to guarantee she will lead Britain out of the crisis.

A caller asked how the PM will celebrate with husband Philipthings DO go to plan - and the deal passes. She was at a total loss.

Pack up Theresa and inform the Sun.Pour away the inept and sweep the dead wood. This party now can never come to any good. If theres one thing Western democracy has proven, it is that no-one can be trusted with power for very long.A first administration achieves change the second stagnates and a third,it appears, eats itself from the feet up. The same is true of every party, in every nation, and there is none among us who would be immune to the madness of power were it delivered for a third time.It sends all politicians who have ever managed it into the sort of cocaine-inspired bender Elton John was once famous for - trying to outdo Freddie Mercury with their own sense of misplaced grandeur, while actually being destined for a le in which they look forward to the John Lewis Christmas ad. It happened to Thatcher, it happened to Blair, and now its happening to the entire Conservative Party at once. This time its not a prime ministers career doomed to failure -  years of British politics is circling the plughole, entirely unaware of its looming extinction.   Over Thatchers time in office she burned every friend she had, endeared herself to half the country by presiding over an economic boom, and flushed middle-class goodwill down the toilet with the poll tax. Tory MPs with an eye to their own survival queued up to kne her as their only escape, and combined with the fact shed destroyed the other half of the country along with unions and manufacturing her time was nigh. Blair started out as a nice-sweatered saviour and came to believe he was genuinely touched by God, able to heal wars, depose despots with his righteousness and had no need to plan for the future because he was going to be raptured as soon as hed fixed the Middle East. He even tried to go one better than Jesus by cutting a deal with his personal Judas, and the net result was the whole Labour Party got stuck in the psychodrama and forgot they were supposed to be working for the people.Now we are in our eighth year of the Tories being in control, and theyve gone completely round the bend in half the time it took the others. Lets be kind. Theyve managed a fourth administration on a technicality, been presented with the most complex political problem in British history, and had the backwash of the Great Recession to deal with. But a party operating in the realms of sanity would not have called the fourth election, would not have attempted to settle centuries of squabbling with Europe by flipping a coin, or claimed to be fixing the economy by letting bankers keep their hands on the interestingly-smashy bits.The fact they were going round the twist so early in their reign is the surest sign this is the end game all decisions since  have been touched by madness, with the inevitable result that the Tories now think they really CAN lick their elbow because theyve spent so long claiming to be the only party you can trust with dficult stuff. Every economic, housing, health, justice and education policy did more to reduce than to improve them. This is not a political point but a factual one - the Tories have managed not one single victory, no shining achievement, in almost a decade of control. But there is a near-infinite number of turds. They deported British citizens in the Windrush scandal. They watched  people die in a towering inferno and sent benefit fraudsters to jail quicker than those who caused the deaths. Under their rule , people are thought to have needlessly died. An unprecedented rise in mortality has been linked directly to their policies. The greatest British invention of all time, the National Health Service, is being thoughtlessly destroyed for lack of maintenance. More than a million people are living in destitution and while they crow about near-full employment, millions of those in work rely on charity to feed their families.The Tories, whatever you may think of them, have never been so definitively linked to death and misery. If they had their wits about them, the backbenchers should, about now, be trying to dig their party out of this homicidal mire. Instead theyre declaring every disaster is someone s fault.  Having secured the countrys backing for Brexit, they spent two years arguing with themselves to the detriment of the British economy. Having secured the agreement of the EU on how to Brexit, they want to go back to negotiating it. And despite being called the Conservative and Unionist Party they seem prepared to throw Northern Ireland on the bonfire to appease their most eccentric members.They spent the first year of negotiations demanding Theresa May call an election to secure her mandate, and after she did so spent the second year demanding her head. The million letters of no confidence they cheerfully predicted turned into  they expected by pm, then definitely , then somewhere nearer . They dont even have confidence in their lack of confidence, and their only chance of passing a motion is with internal application of WD-. And while repeatedly calling themselves the party of law and order they let off their own sex pest because he says he was ill, when all sex pests in whatever courts remain open are sent down without mercy.Theyre now a minority government pretending theyre not, killing citizens while claiming to be acting in the national interest, and the only reason this rabid party hasnt been put out of its self-destructive misery is because the Opposition is too busy shooting itself in the foot.

I arrived here in one,” he smiles. “I’ve always preferred them.” But the clear dference between  and  is then -year-old Leslie was attempting bravely to look forwards today, aged , he is bravely looking back. With -year-old grandson Oscar by his side, he sits on the Harwich to London Liverpool Street train retracing his steps as one of  Jewish children to arrive on the first Kindertransport.   December  will mark eight decades since that groundbreaking rescue mission as the persecution faced by Jews in Nazi Germany intensied. They were waved off in Berlin, taken by train to the Hook of Holland, and then sailed across the Channel to arrive in Harwich, Essex the following day. Weeks later, young Leslie shytravelled this route to London before being transferred to a boarding school in Kent. Some , more children would follow until the outbreak of war in September . Recalling that first morning, Leslie says: “We landed after a very stormy night, everyone except me was sick. “We were all unslept, unkempt, unwashed and bewildered. We were in the same clothes, I had only eaten the shysandwiches my mother gave me.  Holocaust survivor tells of brave Polish family who risked their lives to protect him“I brought underclothes, carefully labelled with my name which my mother had stitched, a couple of extra shirts and an extra sweater, handkerchiefs, a book or two, and a tiny little teddy bear.” But the most treasured items were passport photographs of his mother and father, Charlotte and Arthur Baruch, and beloved sister Eva Susanne, who was two years older. Is there anything  he wishes he had been able to bring  “My sister,” Leslie replies, his voice almost lost in a train announcement. Leslie heard Eva chose not to come because she had fallen in love with a doctor at the hospital where she was a trainee nurse. Later, the -year-old wrote she had received a suitcase as a gt, a hint she may have changed her mind. It was too late. She and their parents were transported to their deaths in . “She was a headstrong young woman,” says Leslie. “We quarrelled of course, but we loved each other... I’ve had a huge dose of luck in my le.  But then there was my family’s fate...” That luck began with his parents’ selflessness. When Nazi shypersecution in his shyhometown of Koumlslin, then in Germany but now Poland, drove him from school, they sent him to an orphanage in Berlin to protect him. It did so more than they could have known. After Kristallnacht in early November , when the Nazis ransacked Jewish property and shysynagogues, he was one of seven from the orphanage selected by the director for the Kindertransport. “I don’t know on what basis I was chosen,” Leslie shrugs. “He was taken to Auschwitz and died. Most of the boys that remained were sent there, too. The real heroes of the Kindertransport were the parents. They gave away their children without knowing where they would finish up.” On December  his stood at the station. “I can see them still. They tried to maintain a stf upper lip and not cry,” he says.  “They waved shyhandkerchiefs. I didn’t cry. To an extent it was an adventure, not realising we’d never see our parents again.” Oscar admits shyly: “I think I’d cry. To leave your parents. If grandpa had not come over, I wouldn’t be here. It is amazing.” Leslie recalls the complete hush on the train. The Nazi police were hostile in some carriages children were abused. “We were told we had to be on our very best behaviour in case the German authorities threw us off or turned the train back,” he says. On reaching Holland that changed. Astonishingly, a photograph captures Leslie in that moment, standing in the carriage within a group, anxiety darkening his face. “I was thinking where am I going, what’s happening to me, what does the future hold ” he recalls. The atmosphere in Harwich as the children stepped off the boat to a throng of press was welcoming. “The policemen smiled at us,” he says. They were taken to the holiday camp Dover Court. Some were selected by couples, but he was chosen for Bunce Court boarding school in Kent. He flourished there, while missing his family, who sent treasured Red Cross telegrams. The last came in September  from his father.  Leslie describes the “extremely wild handwriting.” It reads, simply: “We are going on a journey.” “I know now he had already been told to go to an assembly point two days later. At the time I didn’t know what it meant,” he adds. Leslie joined the British army in , changing his name to Brent, hoping he would be helping his family. Tragically, they were already dead. He assumed they died in Auschwitz. In , shytravelling in Poland on a lecture tour as a scientist specialising in immunology, he visited the former camp, and broke down for the first time. It was to be a few more decades before official records revealed they were taken to Riga, Latvia, and shot in woodland. After making contact with a friend who survived, Leslie adds: “I discovered when my parents were deported Eva needn’t have gone. She was working in a hospital serving both Jews and non-Jews so she might have been protected.  But she didn’t want to leave them.” It’s important to Leslie people know about his headstrong sister and his brave parents. He couldn’t do anything for them  years ago but he can do this. He sits close to the grandson who would not be here today without the Kindertransport, and smiles. “When I die there will be no one left who knew them. But it keeps them alive when they are in people’s memories.”For more information visit ajr.org.uk.

Today a whopping pound.bn was splashed out, kickstarting an pound.bn four day pre-Christmas shopping spree. But as bargain hunters flock online to find the best deals, experts told shoppers they must take extra precautions to beef-up their online security to protect themselves from being a victim of the crimes. And they warned failing to do so - through a combination of internet scams, weak passwords and mistaking fake websites as genuine - could see online shoppers targeted to the tune of poundm, particularly those shopping online on Monday. Simon McCulloch, director at comparethemarket, warned: “As more and more people choose to shop online, our money is made increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber criminals. “Six million Brits are at risk of fraud over the four day shopping period - with cyber Monday being a peak time for hackers.   “Banks and retailers must do their best to protect customers from fraud, not least because data compromises can lead to customers voting with their feet and switching accounts. The warnings come after mobile phones took a key role in Black Friday as shoppers snapped up deals from their bedrooms, at the bus stop and on the train – rather than heading to the high street. Argos said half of its orders so far had been made on a handset, up from % last year, while Currys PC World said % of their online purchases were made via mobile devices. Debenhams and Game Digital’s websites crashed on Thursday evening, while Carphone Warehouse said it received  orders per minute on its site, with the Samsung Galaxy S and Apple iPhone XR being the most popular items.   And HSBC became the latest high street bank to report IT issues after customers were locked out of their online accounts on the busiest shopping day of the year. A quarter of Brits in the last year have been a victim of online fraud - losing a staggering pound.bn, figures from online security firm Sophos found. Many were tricked through bogus emails and websites but most commonly from failing to take basic precautions to protect themselves. GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre technical director, Ian Levy, advised: “Checkyour account has been compromised in a data breach at haveibeenpwned before you go shopping. “If you haven’t changed your password since one of those data breaches and you were involved, go change it before you do stuff.” Head of public engagement Kate Sinnott, from GCHQ, added: “It’s really important not to have a password that can in any way be associated with you, be it your partner’s name, your child’s name, your street address. Anything like that can be guessed by criminals. Make it random.”   She also advised against making an account with retailers soa data breach takes place your information is stored on their site as well having a separate “super-protected” password for your email account. If you think you have fallen victim she advised shoppers to contact their bank as well as “take a note of what the website is, immediately close down your internet browser and report those details to Action Fraud. “ Kate added: “Unfortunately loads of people are falling victim to fraud, so it’s not you. “But,there’s something that’s making you feel uncomfortable or a little bit suspicious about the transaction, such as asking you for an excessive amount of information, take action quickly.” A new Black Friday scam emerged last year, which included more than , malicious Black Friday-themed apps spoofing the branding of global online retailers. The apps tricked shoppers into entering credit card information or Facebook and Gmail login details. Simon McCulloch, director at comparethemarket, also advised customers to make payments over pound with a credit card which protects transactions “under Section  of the Consumer Credit Act, soyou are victim of fraud you should be able to get your money back.” "},{"url":null,"title":"7 signs black friday must","story":" signs Black Friday must be banned in America because they cant be trusted with itYes, we all love to watch the carnage unfold but some people take it too far.

After failing to prove that her six years of income since first letting the garages in  was legally gotten, Nadeem received a confiscation order from Isleworth Crown Court of pound,. and was fined a further pound,.   Councillor Joanna Camadoo said: “We’re very pleased to get such a positive result at the end of a very long and drawn out case.

It’s a tragedy that tenants are being exploited in this way, forced to live in Dickensian conditions by unscrupulous landlords like Mrs Nadeem.   This case is a warning to other property owners who think they can ignore the law – anyone who builds properties in our borough without planning permission can expect a knock on the door from our enforcement officers.” “Paying council tax is not the same as having planning permission and failure to comply with planning notices is a criminal offence. If we issue you with one, act on it before we hit you with a hefty fine and a criminal record.” Nadeem will receive a prison sentence of four yearsthe bill is not paid by January  .

Kate Middleton reportedly had to make a big compromise for her wedding in  after a royal request clashed with what she wanted. In the documentary William and Kate: The Journey, journalist Ashley Pearson describes what is said to have happened.  She said: “Royal sources tell me that the Royals indicated very strongly to Kate that they would prefer her to wear her hair up for this very special occasion. “However, Kate had her heart set on wearing her hair down with long flowing curls, which is her favourite way to wear it, and actually Williams favourite as well. In the end, Kate apparently went for a compromise and wore her hair half-up and half-down with curls. It wasnt the biggest tradition the Duchess of Cambridge broke when she tied the know with Prince William on April , . She was also the first commoner to marry into the immediate family in  years.  Author Jessica Jayne described in her book The Duchess of Cambridge: How Kate Middleton Became A Future Queen how: “All of those who have lambasted Kate and criticised her for being common ate their words. “Back in the old days, a commoner marrying into royalty may just be a dream but times have changed, Kate would be the first commoner to marry a prince in  years.” US actress Meghan Markle became the second commoner to marry into the Windsors when she tied the knot with Prince Harry in May this year, becoming the Duchess of Sussex.She did wear her hair up so might not have been so bothered about the tradition and wanted to please the royals.

A royal source said: The initial plan was for Harry and Meghan to move out of their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and into one of the main apartments. But there has been a bit of tension between the brothers. Now Harry and Meghan don’t want to live next to William and Kate and want to strike out on their own.  They need more room and hope Frogmore Cottage will be ready in time for when they have the baby. Frogmore House has ten bedrooms and a nursery for their baby which is expected in the spring of . It is where Meghan and Harrys lavish wedding reception was held in May. Last week a royal source was also quoted saying: Harry and Meghan want to move, and need more space, but they don’t want to live next door to William and Catherine.

There are plenty of other options, including using their own money to buy their own place.

Forecasters are predicting weeks of on-and-off snowfall between now and Christmas, with temperatures plummeting well below freezing. They say a battleground scenario will play out over the coming weeks, with snow and less wintery fronts constantly clashing over the UK. Earlier this week, the first snowfall of this winter left parts of the UK blanketed in snow. Drivers in Derbyshire and Yorkshire took to social media to share images of perilous conditions on the roads - something many of us may experience as we get closer to Christmas.  Winter travel - how to make sure you arent left out of pocket here or abroad As polar gales from Siberia sweep across the country, the feels-like temperature could plummet to a bone-chilling -. Eleanor Bell, principal meteorologist for the Weather Company, told The Sun: We expect this winter to be dferent to the last seven milder winters we have had, with an increased risk for colder intrusions across the northern half of Europe and below normal temperatures through January and February. We do think that next week’s ‘battleground’ scenario could recur several times in the weeks ahead, giving the potential for further snowfalls in the run-up to Christmas. Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said: It will stay cold for the rest of this week.  It will be feeling cold as we head towards the weekend and south west England could be at risk of some heavy rain and thunder. For Sunday, we lose the risk of thundery showers in the south west and where will be cloudy with showers. While the outlook is certainly looking pretty chilly, the south west is set for a drenching this weekend, with forecaster predicting up to  inches of rain in just  hours. Bands of heavy rain will be thundery at times, and some showers may contain small hail, the Met Office says.  Millions of Brits are at risk of power cuts, damage to homes and travel chaos during the harsh weather. The Met Office yellow warning for rain said: Bands of heavy, at times thundery, showers are expected to affect parts of southwest England from Friday morning until later on Saturday. Whilst most areas will see a rather wet spell, not everywhere will see the heaviest downpours. Where they do occur, - mm may fall in - hours, with perhaps around  mm falling in  hours - most likely across southeast-facing coasts and moors of Devon and Cornwall. Showers may also contain small hail at times.

Natalie Martins, from Surrey, gives the poignant voiceover as a man listens to a tape of his mothers final loving Christmas message after opening a box of old casettes. The budget festive film, named Love is a Gt, racked up more than six million views on Facebook this week after filmmaker Phil Beastall posted it in response to John Lewiss poundmillion big budget production starring Elton John. Ms Martins is an award-winning actress and has featured in seven feature films,  short films as well as TV shows and adverts. She took home the Best Actress award for Miracle Grow at the London Independent Film Festival . After the film went viral, Natalie Martins posted: Oh my word! Love is a Gt has now hit the million view mark. All the feels around the nation! Thanks to everyone who is sharing out short film.   A special film with a special message. Congratulations Phil Beastall on this achievement - this didnt happen by chance or sheer luck - this happened because you are a talented filmmaker and a wonderful storyteller.

Fans of the tear-jerker are calling for John Lewisto hire the budget filmmaker for their next festive advert.  Mr Beastall wrote: Off the back of the John Lewis Christmas advert I wanted to share my very own Christmas film which I made back in . Its a short film about a man counting down the days to Christmas so he can continue his yearly tradition sparked by a tragic moment from the past. One Facebook user said: It will be my th Christmas without my mum x it’s always gut wrenching every year... Its a sad lonely time for a lot of people. Phil, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said: A lot of people are saying how it has touched them and made them feel that they can cope a little bit more this Christmas, which is amazing. I never expected that at all. To think people are getting so much from my film. I am blown away.  Phil said: People seem to like my film because its the story that shines through. You don’t always need a huge budget, just an impactful narrative that gets the message across. I think theres a bit of a revolution going on in the advertising industry. People no longer want to be overtly sold something which makes our job as video producers a lot harder because we have to sell indirectly. Phil said that although he enjoyed John Lewis advert, he thinks spending so much on an advert when people struggle financially isnt sitting well with people. ButJohn Lewis knocked on my door tomorrow and said would you want to make next year’s film I would obviously snap it up in an instant.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there.

He defends well and can play long balls when it’s needed.“I think what goes unrecognised is thathe is told to pass the ball Scott is more than willing to step forward and find a pass.“That is important because in modern day football there are a lot of managers wanting their defenders to step in and pass the ball.“That’s certainly the case in England – maybe at Aberdeen they play more direct, I don’t know.“But for Scotland you can see that Scott is good at both.”"},{"url":null,"title":"marks getting rey dy to show staying power","story":"Injured Dons defender Mark Reynolds says he wants to stay at Pittodrie beyond the summer.Reynolds hasn’t featured for Aberdeen this season after rupturing a cruciate ligament in a pre-season friendly against Cove Rangers at the Balmoral Stadium on July .The -year-old’s contract with the Reds is up next summer.Reynolds, who joined the Dons on loan in  before signing permanently in January , is keen to stay at the club.

Brexit deal.Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that there is currently no majority in the House of Commons to pass a Brexit agreement, but he expects the UK to avoid a “no-deal” option.Lord Darling, who controlled the UK’s finances under Prime Minister Gordon Brown between  and , was speaking after he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Aberdeen University yesterday.He told the Evening Express: “I’ve always believed that a deal will be done, although it’s quite possible that it will be eleventh hour, because you have to get it through the House of Commons.“And it’s clear that there isn’t a majority for anything other than no-deal.“However, I think that a deal will be done, because it will be calamitous for the UK to drop out with no-deal, and it would be equally as bad for the rest of the European Union.“A no-deal is just not worth thinking about.”The former Chancellor also questioned the protests of politicians in favour of leaving the European Union to the current agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May.He said: “Where did leavers think that we were going to end up “There has never been a trade deal in the world where one side gets exactly what it wants, and the other side get absolutely nothing in .“It’s the uncertainty that worries me, which will affect the north-east, the rest of Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom.”Lord Darling also pointed to the effect that Brexit may have on his former university.He said: “Just look at this university, the contracts that it’s got through the European research funds.“We live in a global world, you can’t just close the door and say ‘we’re closed’.“It doesn’t work like that.”During his address to the graduates, Lord Darling spoke of the “isive” nature of the current political climate.Lord Darling said that the Conservative Party has a particular ide over Europe.He said: “There is something about Europe that does something to the Conservative Party, it was like that the whole time that I was there, it does something to people.“Butyou look at the younger generation, they don’t think it’s a particularly big deal.“Just look at the ersity on show here during this graduation, it reflects the global world in which we live.”Lord Darling also said that he can’t see who would take over from Prime Minister Theresa May should she be the subject of a vote of no confidence.He said: “Realistically, I can’t imagine who would take over the Tories right now, because the same fate would await them.”Speaking after the ceremony, the member of the House of Lords had some advice for graduating students.He said: “Do what you feel good about.“A good education will enable you to do most things, but you’ll be constantly changing and learning new things, because most people do several things in their lives.“A degree doesn’t usually see people through to the time where they’re picking up their gold watch.”"},{"url":null,"title":"church gets hollywood

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came

are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"foster-eu-withdrawal-text-not-in-nis-long-term-interests","story":"The draft EU withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Irelandrsquos long-term interests, Arlene Foster will tell her party conference later.The country would inevitably begin to erge from its largest market, the rest of the UK,it remained part of the EUrsquos customs code under the backstop arrangement, the DUP leader will declare before massed crowds of supporters in Belfast.The backstop is a fallback designed to avoid a hard Irish border which would see Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU rules around tradeno better solution can be found.Mrs Foster is expected to say: ldquoWe cannot wish away the fact that the draft withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Irelandrsquos long-term economic or strategic interests.ldquoNorthern Ireland would remain part of the European Unionrsquos customs code and as things stand we would be sowing the seeds of inevitable economic ergence from our largest market.Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson is also expected to address the DUP conference on Saturday.Mrs Foster acknowledged the frustration of many in Northern Irelandrsquos business community with the pace of negotiations.Her party has prided itself on its relationship with firms, but relations have been strained by their support for the draft UK-EU deal.Mrs Foster has said the DUP may revisit its deal to support the Conservatives in key votes at Westminster.She will tell her annual conference: ldquoI acknowledge the hard work and determined efforts of the Prime Minister to secure an agreement.ldquoShe is genuine when she says she wants to see an outcome that does no harm to the Union and the internal market of the United Kingdom.ldquoHowever, this draft agreement fails her own key commitments.ldquoThe Prime Minister has not been able to guarantee an outcome that eliminates the risk of the introduction of the so-called backstop arrangements.Mrs Foster is expected to urge negotiators to seek a better outcome.The position of Gibraltar had been one of the issues facing EU states attempting to agree a common position on UK withdrawal.Spain is pressing for a guarantee over its say on the future of Gibraltar.A delegation from the British overseas territory on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula travelled to take part in the DUP conference.The DUP leader is expected to pledge: ldquoWe stand with the people and the government of Gibraltar at this time.Nigel Dodds, the DUPrsquos leader at Westminster, is expected to tell the conference that without his partyrsquos support the Government would have been defeated in almost half of all votes on the EU Withdrawal Act.ldquoThe Governmentrsquos commitments under it are clearhellip including on Brexit.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Indeed, this bustling port on the Isle of Lewis has a thriving arts, culture and food scene that puts many bigger mainland towns to shame.Itrsquos also a place to soak up Gaelic hospitality, history and tradition, while appreciating the ever-changing terrains of this magical, wind-swept isle.Historical HighlightsKnown as Stjoacuternavaacutegr, or ldquosteering bay in Old Norse, Stornoway was founded by the Vikings in the early th century, people have inhabited Lewis for around  years.The main street, Cromwell Street, is named for Oliver Cromwell, whose forces fought to take control of the town in .Owned by the Mackenzies of Seaforth for more than  years, Lewis was sold to Sir James Matheson for pound, in . The new laird built Lews Castle, which still overlooks the bay, as well as many of the islandrsquos roads and schools.With its sheltered harbour and strategic location, Stornoway played a key role in both world wars.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

I think we have all got to go to fight any injustice.Ms OrsquoFarrell said she agreed with Ms Sturgeonrsquos statement and shared an anecdote of how a male journalist had asked her ldquowhy are your books so female Ms Sturgeon said men are never asked similar questions about their work being male-centred.The talk initially focused on Ms OrsquoFarrellrsquos body of work and her recent memoir I Am, I Am, I Am, about the  near-death experiences that have punctuated and defined her le.Ms Sturgeon praised Ms OrsquoFarrellrsquos writing, saying: ldquoI am a Irsquom a great fan of your work... You have such strong female characters in your writing.Ms OrsquoFarrell, a Northern Irish author of seven novels and the winner of the  Costa Novel Award for The Hand That First Held Mine, said the title of her memoir is taken from acclaimed American writer and poet Sylvia Plathrsquos only novel The Bell Jar, which is about a womenrsquos descent into madness. It comes from the sentence ldquoI took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.Two of Ms OrsquoFarrellrsquos recommended favourite books also interestingly featured women who were insane or descending into insanity.Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte features Mr Rochesterrsquos we Bertha who is described as insane throughout the novel, while th-century American novel The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman features a woman suffering from postnatal depression who ends up going mad after her physician husband prevents her from reading or working in an attempt to cure her.Gilmanrsquos book is considered to be a critique of the way the overwhelmingly male medical profession attempted to control and silence women.Ms OrsquoFarrell read Mrs Darwin from Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffyrsquos book The Worldrsquos We, which is about the perspectives of wives of ious famous men.In it, Mrs Darwin is on a trip to the zoo with her husband Charles, who is renowned for his theory of evolution, and says to him: ldquoSomething about that chimpanzee over there reminds me of you. The poem suggests that it was Mrs Darwin, and not her husband, who was the brains behind his work.Ms Sturgeon said that one of the books that had most impact on her le was Sunset Song by Lewis Grassic Gibbon because it had a ldquoreally strong female character in the form of Chris Guthrie.Both spoke about how they were influenced by French writer and feminist Simone de Beauvoir.Around  people attended the event at Stirling Castle, which sold out within  hours."},{"url":null,"title":"community gathers to remember mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Game of Thrones star Iain Glen may have recovered from deadly greyscale in the epic drama but hes asking his fellow Scots to own up to the inevitable and make a will. \"  \"  What do Iain Glen, Dame Judi Dench, Graham Norton and Robert Peston have in common  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“The money will be used to support other families to help them build hope for the future and to make them smile again.”Grampian Child Bereavement Network is a small charity that provides direct support to bereaved children and young people throughout the region."},{"url":null,"title":"academy hosts art exhibition","story":"Inverurie Academy held its second Art Exhibition on Thursday, November .The exhibition featured ious pieces of artwork by National , Higher and Advanced Higher pupils.Pupil Natalie Thomson with her work Pick  Mix TreatsHead of Creative Arts at Inverurie Academy, Olefine Richardson, said: “This year we have  National  exhibitors, ten Higher and one Advanced Higher.“The work on display is by our th, th and th year pupils.“This is the second year that we have held an art exhibition at the school and it is bigger than last year’s event.“The evening celebrates the pupils’ exceptional work and the phenomenal effort that they have put in to it.Many pupils created designs for new items including an apron, umbrella, and perfume boxes“We are really proud of them all and their hard work.”S Higher pupil Natalie Thomson had her work ‘ Pick  Mix Treats’ on display.Natalie said: “I chose Pick and Mix because it was fun to draw and I could eat it afterwards.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amSome Orkney Islands Council facilities, such as schools, care homes and marine services,  may face IT disruption this weekend as the council carries out further repairs to a vital fibre optic link which was damaged on November .

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Saturday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In terms of David Mundell’s position I would simply say this – his position is a matter for him, butDavid Mundell is still in office by the end of today in light of this political declaration he will have forfeited forever any last remaining scrap of principle or credibility that he had.”Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson branded the political declaration “unacceptable” as he said the UK “must be a normal independent coastal state like Norway”.He tweeted the “political declaration commits UK to establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter allia, access to waters and quota shares” and added: “This means sovereignty over our waters sacriced for a trade deal.”Mr Mundell said he was “not taking lessons on standing up for fisherman from Nicola Sturgeon, who is committed to trapping them in hated CFP”.He added: “The PM has fiercely resisted the efforts of EU states to make an explicit link between access to our waters and access to markets.“We will negotiate and decide, as an independent coastal state, on access and quota on an annual basis just like Norway and Iceland do now. The surest way to guarantee the EU access to Scottish waters would be to rejoin the CFP – exactly what Nicola Sturgeon is demanding.”Addressing the issue of fishing rights in the Commons yesterday, Mrs May said the agreement reached with the EU would not be “traded off” against other priorities.Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, said: “The declaration gives the UK the power to assert its position as an independent coastal state with practical sovereignty over our waters.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833802.1542916079!/image/image.jpg","title":"alastair dalton we need genuinely cyclable cities by reassigning road space","story":"Inside Transport: One of the joys of cycling is riding along a smooth, traffic-free path, writes Alastair Dalton.If that also involves whizzing past vehicles at a standstill on an congested road next door, so much the better for your choice of transport.I also like the look of rural off-road sections of the national cycle network in Scotland,  per cent of which has just been officially judged as being in a good or very good condition.Viewed from the train on the Edinburgh-Glasgow route via Bathgate and Airdrie, you can follow the still pristine-looking cycle path which was rebuilt eight years ago when the line was re-opened.Other stretches of the network, such as between Oban and Fort William, look even more alluring.Unfortunately, the picture is the opposite on road sections of the network, with the official survey by cycling and walking body Sustrans finding  per cent of them in poor condition.That’s borne out by my own experience, with other cycle lanes in such a bad state they deter riders venturing on to them.Too often such lanes remain potholed while the rest of the road has been repaired or resurfaced, too narrow for cyclists to feel safe, and blocked by parked vehicles when no driver would dare park across a road.Some cycle lanes start and then suddenly peter out, sometimes with a kerb built out across them. Signs and markings can be inconsistent and even contradictory, as to be of no help to cyclist or driver alike.Advanced stop lines at traffic lights, a crucial safety feature for riders turning right, frequently have worn-out markings which render them invisible even to motorists who know it’s illegal to stop on them.Off-road paths may be in better nick, and there’s normally more space to ride round the potholes, but they are also plagued by other horrors such as tree roots distorting surfaces that make for an uncomfortably bumpy.Incomplete sections have become white elephants, such as the Bears Way between Glasgow and Milngavie, a segregated . mile route created by narrowing the busy A which requires cyclists to merge back into the traffic at either end.Against a background of ministers imploring us to cycle more, it’s a distinctly uninviting prospect. From this evidence on the ground, cycling is demonstrably not being afforded its place in the transport pecking order that the policymakers have given it.What’s needed is the creation of genuinely cyclable cities, a genuinely cyclable country. What we have are piecemeal sections of adequate cycle paths that require riders to run the gauntlet of hazards to get between them.Cycle lanes need to be given enhanced status to reflect their importance in helping to literally pave the way for the signicant increase in cycling the Scottish Government wants.Its “vision” has been of  per cent of trips being made by bike by  - a gigantic rise from around  per cent with little more than a year to achieve it.Space for cycling on roads should be reserved and respected for the myriad benefits it brings, from reducing congestion and pollution to the health benefits for riders and the reduced toll on the NHS.It’s not impossible. Russian city of Almetyevsk increased its cycling rate from zero to  per cent in  months. It’s all about who gets priority on the roads and how much we’re prepared to sht the balance.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833671.1542921727!/image/image.jpg","title":"driverless buses to start edinburgh fife journeys within months","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots commuters will be the first in the UK to travel on driverless buses when a pilot is introduced to run vehicles over the Forth Road Bridge between Edinburgh and Fe.Bus giant Stagecoach will operate the new trial service, expected in , which will see five single-deck buses carrying  passengers travelling  miles from Ferrytoll Park and Ride in Fe to the Edinburgh Park tram exchange, near the Gyle.With buses every  minutes, this could provide an estimated , weekly journeys.The buses will be used autonomously to “level four” standard, meaning a driver must remain on board during any journey in line with UK regulations.The initiative is part of a UK-wide trial of driverless vehicles, which will see two other pilots of “autonomous” taxi services taking place in London. The Scottish scheme received £. million of a £m UK grant to help make driverless technology on UK streets a reality.Scottish Government Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: “This is a very exciting development and underlines the potential Scotland has when it comes to connected and autonomous vehicles. The Forth has been at the centre of engineering innovation over three centuries and it is fitting that it will be central to this next innovation in transport and our Programme for Government commitments to intelligent mobility.: Man arrested after rocks thrown at Ruth Davidson’s Edinburgh office“The deployment of these vehicles in Scotland will bring transformative change to the way we travel and work, as well as having a positive impact on the economy, the environment and safety.”Work on the vehicles is being carried out at busmaker Alexander Dennis’s site in Guildford, with the buses expected to be ready for use at the start of . In the short term, the buses will be used in driverless mode within the depot to carry out movements such as parking and moving into the fuelling station and bus wash.The system uses several sensors, including radar, laser, camera and ultrasound along with satellite navigation, to detect and avoid objects and plan routes.Improved safety, reduced congestion, increased effic­iency and lower staffing costs have been billed among potential benefits of driverless buses.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: “I’m delighted that Edinburgh has been chosen as a base for this exciting project.“The city is a hotbed for innovation and this £.m grant is welcome further support for Scotland’s research and technology sectors. The UK government’s Modern Industrial Strategy [published last year] is investing in the UK’s future through innovation. Autonomous vehicles are just one example of that commitment in driving the UK forward.”Stagecoach, Alexander Dennis and technology firm Fusion Processing announced earlier this year that work was underway to trial the first full-sized autonomous vehicle.The bus will use both on-road and hard shoulder running, and will operate on the “old” Forth Road Bridge, which is now a dedicated public transport corridor allowing buses and taxis to usededicated lanes between the M near Newbridge and Halbeath in Fe.In London, Project Apollo, led by Addison Lee, who are working with a number of software companies, will receive £. million towards the development of autonomous taxis, building on its existing tests in Greenwich.A second pilot in the capital, ServCity – headed up by Jaguar Land Rover – takes £. million of the funding as it develops a mobility service using six autonomous Land Rover Discovery vehicles. UK government Business Secretary Greg Clark said: “Autonomous vehicles and their technology will not only revolutionise how we travel, it will open up and improve transport services for those who struggle to access both private and public transport. “The UK is building on its automotive heritage and strengths to develop the new vehicles and technologies and from  the public will get to experience the future for themselves.” Mr Clark was taken on a test vehicle run by autonomous vehicle software company Oxbotica – the first person outside its technical team to try the autonomous mode anywhere on the streets of the United Kingdom.All the projects will include social behavioural research to understand how driverless technology can be integrated into society and applied to the development for future autonomous service models.The Centre for Connected Autonomous Vehicleswas established in  to ensure the UK was a world leader in the development and testing of self-driving technologies.A total of £m, match-funded by industry, is being invested by the UK Government, propelling self-driving technology in the UK.The UK Modern Industrial Strategy published last year aims to

said: \"The additional funding will enable Scottish Canals to undertake a number of projects including work on the Caledonian Canal, one of Scotlands best known waterways, which attracts almost , visitors each year.\"It is essential that this work is carried out now to alleviate the immediate pressure at Fort Augustus for both commercial and leisure vessels.ldquoThe repairs will also help ensure that boats will be able to continue to use the canal in future years as it approaches its th anniversary in .\"These repairs will be in addition to the planned maintenance that Scottish Canals will be carrying out this year as part of its asset management programme.Scottish Canals chief executive Catherine Topley, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news and is testament to the ongoing conversations we are having with the Scottish Government about the value of the canals to Scotland.ldquoThese working heritage assets are incredibly important, not only to Scotlandrsquos marine economy but in attracting tourists, visitor spend and investment, stimulating job creation and business growth as well as helping to protect the environment.\"This additional investment not only helps to improve the assets themselves but supports our efforts to generate income that can be reinvested in the canals.Ms Topley had warned ministers in June: ldquoWithout additional investment, we will continue to see asset decline and asset failures ndash some of which may be substantial.\"Gavin Corbett, Green councillor for Fountainbridge-Craiglockhart on Edinburgh City Council, said: \"I am delighted to see more funding going to improve and maintain our canals.\"The work on the Forth  Clyde Canal bridges will certainly help through traffic from Edinburgh to Bowling, which has been so disrupted in .\"However, aside from some new investment in dredging, there appears to be nothing earmarked for the Union Canal.\"With the Leamington lt Bridge fenced off at Fountainbridge and steps closed indefinitely at Slateford, among others, its important the latest funding announcement is just the start of bringing all of the canals up to standard.\"©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie

Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.The building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.The centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this pointand is much needed.I wonder what,any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building  If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion George DicksonI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisationof a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said.

This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"threequarters of belfast telegraph readers reject mays draft deal in snap poll","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To have to pay all that money to the EU, I think it is wrong.\"But Grainne Carson from the Falls Road supported the deal.\"Three of my best friends are from the Shankill, we never discuss politics,\" she said.\"I personally think the deal were getting is going to be beneficial for us, especially small businesses and farming communities.\"I wouldnt put a flag before putting food on my table, its that simple. The UK Government dont see Northern Ireland as anything but a money-draining problemthe DUP have brought that to light on a massive .\"Peter Owens accused the Prime Minister of moving the goalposts. \"The vote was Leave or Remain, I dont remember being offered a third choice on my ballot paper asking was it OK to remain under EU regulationsI voted to leave,\" he said.John Johnston likened the deal to \"paying for a orce and still being married\".\"She appears to have agreed to leave us still tied but costing us a clean fortune,\" he said.Billy Smith said the deal would tie the UK to the customs union as long as the EU sees fit, as well as giving it control over the departure process.\"The UK will not be able to make trade deals with non-EU countries for the foreseeable future and we pay for the privilege,\" he said.Valerie Leonard said with little chance of the UK staying in the EU, it was a \"win-win\" situation for the island of Ireland \"with no threat to British or Irish living here\".She added: \"Brexit did not articulate exactly what people were voting for or against in the first instance and that is the main reason for the current situation.\"Had people been given correct educated information on economics, trade and immigration, I believe people would have not voted to Leave at all.\"Mandy Gordon said Brexit had so sharply ided opinions that Mrs May was facing an \"impossible task\". \"You can never please all of the people all of the time,\" she said.Sarah Louise said that after two years of protracted negotiations \"this is the best we will get\".\"It is better than nothing.

Electricity could face hundreds of new compensation claims following a landmark verdict over a pylon located in a south Belfast couples garden, it was predicted..pushThe Court of Appeal, on Friday, upheld a £, compensation award to Roy and Ivy McKibbin for the companys alleged refusal to remove the tower from the side of their home in the Four Winds area.Judges backed an assessment that the property had diminished in value by % due to the presence of what the couple described as a \"monstrosity\".The McKibbins solicitor, John Gibbons, predicted the test case verdict could open the floodgates to a huge number of similar claims.He said: \"This case now opens the way for all similarly affected homeowners, whose use and enjoyment of their property is diminished by power lines or NIE equipment, to seek suitable compensation.\"There are already many claims lodged with the Lands Tribunal that will now have to be dealt with and we anticipate many hundreds of new claimants will now come forward.\"NIE Networks Ltd mounted appeals following Lands Tribunal decisions related to installations on both industrial and residential property.Under current legislation land owners and occupiers can seek compensation for involuntary \"wayleaves\" required to place equipment and cabling.In one case the Tribunal had awarded £, compensation to cover a drop in market value of Brickkiln Waste Ltds land in Maydown, Derry.Setting aside that award, the court held there had been a failure to demonstrate any diminution.Turning to Mr and Mrs McKibbins case, however, Sir Reg Weir set out how they had requested the removal of NIE equipment after the last of their voluntary agreements ended in .The couple stated that their enjoyment of their house and garden was impaired by birds on the tower leaving droppings on the garden and car beneath.Reference was made to the wires making a \"singing\" noise in some weather conditions, along with dficulties in maintaining their garden due to the pylons legs.\"They describe the tower in their garden as a monstrosity, a description which from the photographs does not seem an exaggeration,\" Sir Reg said.The court also heard a Bank of Ireland policy document expressed reluctance to lend on properties where high power lines pass over the house or garden except in exceptional circumstances.The public perception, whether or not well-founded, is that the health of those living close to power lines may be adversely affected, according to the McKibbins evidence.NIE appealed the Tribunals decision that £, compensation should be paid to reflect the potential drop in the worth of their property.But based on an examination of the evidence and photographs, Sir Reg held that it was fully entitled to assess the diminution in value at %.He added: \"Had it to make its own lay assessment,would have arrived at a figure certainly no less than that.\"The McKibbins were also awarded all their legal costs.Outside court their lawyer confirmed he will be seeking to have other similar cases listed for hearing as soon as possible.Mr Gibbons added: \"As the negative perception of electricity equipment very close to residential property,continues to grow, these types of claims are bound to become more prevalent.\"They are common place in the rest of the UK, where power line companies have been compensating homeowners for decades. \"Unfortunately, up to now, NIE Networks appears to have preferred to fight every claim and bury their head in the sand.\"The boss of Property Compensation Consultants, an English-based firm who fought the case on behalf of the McKibbins, expressed delight at the verdict.Nick Jordan said: \"We are thrilled that after six years of litigation the result has come out in our favour.\"We have got hundreds of clients in Northern Ireland who will hopefully now be able to take their claims forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"boat discovery near newgrange dates back","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC

Documents released under FoI legislation reveal how  decisions that cannot be taken have piled up in the absence of ministers. The figure will be higher because one of the nine departments, the Department of Finance, refused to answer our request.Some have been well publicised, such as the Programme for Government, which sets out the priorities that the Executive will pursue. Approval is also needed on a strategy to deal with suicide, an investment strategy and school development plans.However, there is also a range of lesser known legislation.This includes fishery management plans, remote control automated parking, reforming legal aid expenditure and amending the  Drainage Order.The Department for Communities has  decisions pending - the highest number.Among them is the Employment Act, which includes proposals to force large companies to disclose their gender pay gap. This has been held up by more than  days.A further  decisions are in line at the Department for Infrastructure.These include increasing penalties for using a mobile phone while driving, a series of planning applications and a planned trial scheme to allow certain taxis to use Belfasts bus lanes.The Department for the Economy has  decisions pending, including sign-off on a draft industrial strategy, draft energy strategy and a Superfast Broadband strategy.The Department of Justice has  outstanding decisions, including strategies on domestic violence and tackling paramilitary crime.At the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, decisions on fishery management and water quality monitoring have sat for more than  days.Several departments cannot make public appointments. For example, the Policing Board, which has oversight of the PSNI, has not met since early  because it has no political appointees.The DUP and Sinn Fein continue to blame each other for the impasse.DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: \"Every day new issues arise which cannot be progressed because of Sinn Feins boycott policy.\"The public are suffering and limited powers for civil servants to take decisions are no substitute for democratically-elected representatives taking decisions in the best interests of everyone we represent.\"The DUP has put down no pre-conditions ahead of theof devolution. Its time that Sinn Fein dropped their red lines and put the needs of the public ahead of their narrow sectional interests.\"Sinn Fein said: \"It is the DUPs denial of rights, disrespect and lack of integrity that led to the collapse of the power-sharing institutions.\"Rather than commit to sharing power equally, the DUP then walked away from an agreement in February that would have seen the Assembly and the Executive restored.\"The institutions could be restored immediatelythe DUP, backed by the Tories, ends the disgraceful denial of rights which are enjoyed by citizens everywhere  on these islands.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university to introduce irish language signs at students union","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said it would focus on behaviour, on corporate governance and risk management."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit draft agreement read entire 585","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

spinal condition","story":"A Ballinderry mum says she intends to raise more awareness of an advanced treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on

filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"schools rely on parents dipping into their pockets","story":"County Hall Powys County Council Offices, Llandrindod Wells.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"School budgets reliant on parentsCllr Emily Durrant.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"newtowns railway station bidding for access upgrade","story":"Disabled access at Newtown railway station on Wednesday, November , .MS-ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt-lt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Newtowns railway station bidding for access upgradeA general view of Newtown railway station on Monday, March , .Pic: Mike Shltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgteridan County TimesMltspan classtruncate-full-screengtS-lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Newtowns railway station bidding for access upgradeA general view of Newtown railway station on Wednesday, November , .MS-ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt-lt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"angela receives highest uk air ambulance honour","story":"WAA Chief Executive Angela Hughes receives her Letime Achievement Award.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Angela receives highest UK Air Ambulance HonourWAArsquos fleet of four helicopters.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A request by this newspaper three weeks ago revealed a list of over  decisions. However, a list obtained by the Belfastcontains  decisions.Stormont Castle stressed that it was not a complete list because “it is not possible to specy the terms in which any request for a decision may be put to ministers”. However, the Executive Office said that it expected the list it released to contain many of the proposals which will be put to them “at an early stage”there is either a restoration of devolution or a move to direct rule.The decisions cover every Stormont department with the exception of the Department of Finance, which did not include a response.The decisions which have built up include:• Whether to close or merge schools which are judged unviable talks to DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds before addressing a party fund-raising dinner\"   talks to DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds before addressing a party fund-raising dinner\"  Peter Robinson in eve of conference warning to DUP on state of the Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• A series of major planning applications of Northern Ireland-wide importance• An action plan to root out paramilitarism• Dozens of public appointments• Plans for superfast broadband• Use of recycled manure solids on farms• Funding for safety improvements at football stadiums• Welfare reform mitigation schemes• Radical reforms in health and education.There is some evidence, however, that Ms Bradley’s legislation to give civil servants some powers of ministers is having an effect. The list initially included the inability to raise pay for health workers. However, this week civil servants agreed to a policy which will see that happen.Calling for direct rule ministers, UUP leader Robin Swann said the revelation showed that “government is grinding to a halt”. He added: “Karen Bradley MP wouldn’t stand for it in her own constituency, so I don’t see why the people of Northern Ireland should have to stand for it either”.try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates.
