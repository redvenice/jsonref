[{"url":null,"title":"Inside immaculate Manhattan apartment Americas Organized man","story":"    Andrew J. Mellen lives in Hell\u0027s Kitchen in New York\u0027s Midtown West.  He owns a 700-sq ft apartment in one of the big, multi-amenity apartment blocks overlooking the Hudson  that serve\u0027s a large part of the city\u0027s professional community. First impressions of his apartment on the 9th floor are: NEAT, NEAT and NEAT. Everything has its place.  It\u0027s a simple but effective logic that forms the backbone to his book. If you keep your keys in the same place, without fail, you will never waste time looking for them. Same for your phone charger and wallet. This valuable time, Andrew, says can be better spent doing things you actually enjoy. Note the shoe board for the three pairs he uses most often. A cupboard in the hall stores the others (in shoetrees of course)          \u0027If you can organize your kitchen you can organize your life\u0027: You will not very little plastic in Andrew\u0027s kitchen, nor will you find on a utensil out of place or an appliance that isn\u0027t used. Andrew says: \u0027Pots and pans should have lids, so shouyld food-storage containers (glass over plastic). Appliances should have all their parts. Groceries should be organized into categories. The kitchen should be broken down into zones: Preparation, cooking and baking, beverages, pantry, tableware and cleanup. Before putting a single item away, wash and wipe down the interiors of every cabinet and drawer. This system begins to unravel the minute you defer returning something to its home in favor if doing it later\u0027.          To achieve your dream kitchen Andrew recommends \u0027sitting down for a minute and breathing. Think about your dream kitchen. Think about the meals you\u0027ll make for those you love. Or even just like. Think about waking up in the morning, walking into the kitchen, pouring yourself or making a delicious cup of coffee. It\u0027s peaceful in this room. Things are put away and there\u0027s room to breathe. Room to plan and to spread out. Your knives are sharp, your dishes are clean\u0027.\u0027Horrible\u0027: South Norwood community appalled by Grenfell bonfireGoogle Earth appears to show plane submerged off the Scottish coastGrenfell Inquiry Chairman on shocking video mocking Grenfell towerNo death penalty as Christopher Watts pleads guilty to murderNancy Pelosi thanks candidates for returning House to DemsChloe and Liv talk about their dates on Celeb\u0027s Go DatingMichael Gove has \u0027absolute confident\u0027 in PM\u0027s Brexit planUnion Jack flag burned on bonfire at fireworks display in ThornerAmazon promote their delivery boxes in their new Christmas advertTown\u0027s tribute to its war dead turned into a huge bubble bathNext door neighbour chops up man\u0027s garden shrub over 8 year disputeX Factor judges and Dermot O\u0027Leary present Child of Courage award    Glass over plastic: Andrew recommends this not just because it is more eco-friendly but also that it\u0027s more hygienic, easier to clean and feels better all around. He keeps all of this containers together with their corresponding lids in a drawer near to the sink in the preparation zone of his immaculate kitchen.           Andrew sharpens his knives regularly. HE recommends either doing it yourself or finding someone to do it. \u0027A sharp knife is  a happy knife. And a happy knife is a happy cook\u0027, he says.           The cutlery drawer in his kitchen sparkles. Wood cutlery container over plastic. \u0027Really be honest with yourself about how you live, how you want to live, and how you don\u0027t want to live. If you\u0027re tired of living in a fantasy of someday and ready to live your life as it actually is and, even more important, how you want it to be, chuck the stuff that is holding you back\u0027          He recommends the following simple guide to de-cluttering the kitchen. Ask yourself three questions: Is this object something I currently or frequently use? Is it beautiful? Do I enjoy looking at it. Does it serve a practical purpose in my kitchen? If the answer is no, get rid of it. \u0027Having a pizza stone is useless if you don\u0027t eat carbs, no matter how cool you think it is\u0027, he says.           Practical reclosable freezer bags are always kept stocked in his kitchen to ensure his freezer is kept well organized and items easily visible. So is Andrew OCD? Or just super organised. And whats\u0027s the difference? \u0027I know I\u0027m not OCD because i can go to sleep at night without having to move things\u0027. It\u0027s worth noting that what Mellen espouses is not rocket science, the way he lives is not completely unfamiliar. We all know what a tidy home looks like and we all know what we should do with our own homes to improve them. What Mellen specializes in is explaining the value of living like this and how, if you follow his process, you will free up more time and live a much calmer, productive life.He is the difference between you giving your apartment that one big spring clean before letting it gradually slide back into unorganized chaos and you finally being able to keep on top of the apartment\u0027s organisation and maintaining a clean and tidy place all of the time.\u0027If you act on my advice and are consistent and alert and apply yourself, you will have more time on your hands than you ever thought possible. You will do less, and you will accomplish more.            Andrew\u0027s bedroom is his oasis. His favorite thing? Pressed sheets. \u0027Without help, there\u0027s not a lot of time in the day to press and fold the linens. A tip is to remove the sheets and pillowcases from the dryer while they are still slightly damp and drape them over a shower rod to dry. It\u0027s the next best thing to ironing them, and they come out crisps and without wrinkles.          Art lines almost every wall in Andrew\u0027s apartment. His friends and family are artists and it is mainly there works which take pride of place. He practices Buddhism after dating a Zen monk for two years. This explains the nods to Buddha throughout the apartment. to the right of the dresser, in the  above picture next to the lamp, is an interesting object. It\u0027s an automatic watch winder for his kinetic watch. \u0027My watch is kinetic and I don\u0027t wear it all the time so this keeps it wound. I bought it off Amazon for approximately $40. It says much about Andrew\u0027s commitment to efficiency and not wasting time. Better to spend $40 than spend wasted minutes shaking the watch like most of us have to do EVERY time he goes to wear it.           Andrew calls drawers mini-closets on their sides. Like closets he recommends organizing them by type of clothing. The most important result of organizing your drawers is that \u0027you should be able to see the entire contents of each drawer easily as soon as you open it, as you can for your closets. A drawer should NOT be a crammed and jumbled mess of clothing.           Andrew even insists on keeping similar types of socks together. Thick socks, light socks etc. It\u0027s all fairly obvious advice, but seeing it in practice reminds one of how life becomes so much calmer and easier when things are in their place.           Andrew is all for photos from trips and travel but also believes \u0027people spend so much time documenting their excursions that the first time they actually experience being someplace different is when they get home and look back at photos taken and souvenirs gathered. By then, the experience is over and all you\u0027re left with are artifacts from history, albeit recent history. Put down the cameraand explore, experience, drink up the adventure while having the adventure\u0027.          The best way to strip back your closet and make sure it contains the things you actually use, Andrew recommends sitting down and deciding how many shirts you actually need, how many pairs of pants, shoes etc. If you decide on five long sleeve and five short sleeved shirts, make sure that when you buy a new shirt, get rid of an old one.  One of Andrew\u0027s tips for keeping a tidy closet and bedroom is returning those annoying wire hangers back to the dry cleaners for recycling, while keeping all of your hanging clothes on robust hangers. Couldn\u0027t agree more.  Belt and tie hooks make for easy visibility and reach. Andrew recommends also having a hook, an area or a chair where you can place clothes in \u0027purgatory\u0027 - \u0027the ones that aren\u0027t quite dirty but not quite clean, either. You\u0027d wear them again to run to the market or scrub the kitchen floor but maybe not for lunch  with your mother-in-law\u0027.  It was interesting to learn that Andrew has a housekeeper who also does his laundry and arranges his shirt, just as he requests: Short sleeves at one end, long sleeves at the other and color co-ordinated. Jeans and sweaters are folded and kept above. At first I thought the housekeeper surely means that it isn\u0027t Andrew who is Mr Organized, it\u0027s the staff. But, as Andrew says, it simply means he has more time for the valuable things in life. He knows how his home should be organized and he pays someone to do it. And she does a very good job.           Author Molly O\u0027Neill who sought the help of Andrew Mellen said he \u0027is efficient, no-nonsense, practical and persistent. He delivers order from chaos and he does it fast. I’m still not used to all the clean surfaces and orderly files and figuring out what to do with all the time and energy he’s saved me!\u0027          A sought-after authority on organizing and productivity, Andrew has addressed audiences from Dwell on Design and TEDx to The Great British Business Show and BlogHer\u0027You will always be able to find anything  - in your home or office, kitchen or car - within thirty seconds. You will never be late because you misplaced your keys. You will finally have the time to do the things you love to do. Or to discover the things you love. Or to rediscover them.\u0027What I do is guide you through a precise process that will enable you to unstuff your life of everything that doesn\u0027t serve you and shine a light on everything that does. How\u0027s that sound instead?\u0027Now, full disclosure: Mellen surprised me by revealing that he has a housekeeper. My first thought was surely that\u0027s cheating? The second was: She must have her work cut out. But as he explained, it\u0027s about time saving. He knows how he wants his home to look and how he wants it to make him feel. The fact he is paying someone to implement it simply means he has more free time to do the things he loves and focus on what he considers more valuable endeavors like building relationships with people, maintaining friendships and enjoying his work. You can, it turns out, still be America\u0027s most organized man and have a housekeeper to keep you organized.Dubbed \u0027America\u0027s Most Organized Man\u0027, rather surprisingly, Mellen began his life in the theater. He worked as executive and artistic director at community-based arts organization DC Arts Center in the early 1990s, before moving to Seattle to work as a playwright, actor, producer and director at Alice B. Theater.           \u0027I\u0027m not a minimalist, I\u0027m an essentialist\u0027, reveals Andrew. And he\u0027s no-nonsense too. Not only is he ruthless with his own belongings, but also gifts from other people. No way does he believe these things should clutter your home just because they were given as a present. \u0027Get rid of it as soon as possible. Any object that upon sight causes you pain, grief, regret, embarrassment or disappointment has no place in your life. Re-gift it\u0027.          Just because he espouses living simply and cleanly doesn\u0027t meant that Mellen shies away from color and pattern, as his quirky choice of chairs and artwork shows          Mellen takes inspiration from Buddhism and speaks frequently on the intersection of spirituality and organization at Omega Institute, San Francisco Zen Center, Tassajara, All Saints Church, JCC Manhattan and the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment, among others          Mellen believes clutter leads to an unhappy life, but what counts as clutter depends on the inidual. His vast collection of books, displayed in neat piles around his home, bring him happiness and therefore are not clutter          Mellen uses his apartment as a teaching tool for clients. Mellen leads workshops and speaks internationally while maintaining a private practice working with clients ranging from Fortune 100 companies, trade associations and non-profits to CEOs, filmmakers and authors, as well as overwhelmed parents everywhere          In 2013, Andrew founded Unstuff U®, the world\u0027s first virtual university dedicated to organization and decluttering, offering classes, workshops and other online resources for businesses and inidualsBut in 1996 he decided to take his career in a whole new direction. Following his passion for organization, he began working one-to-one with clients and multinational corporations including Goldman Sachs, American Express and Time, Inc. as a consultant for streamlining work, and keeping things simple.He also wrote a column for Real Simple (Ask the Organizer) and is still a frequent contributor for numerous news sources including Wall Street Journal, CNN Money and NPR, among others. Mellen also wrote best-selling book Unstuff Your Life! which includes his unique The Organizational Triangle®.This is a set of three simple rules to declutter 1: One home for everything, 2: Like with like, meaning similar objects should be stored together and 3: Something in, something out.   Andrew is also a member of the Experts Collective and serves on the faculty of the New York Open Center in New York City. He speaks frequently on the intersection of spirituality and organization at Omega Institute, San Francisco Zen Center, Tassajara, All Saints Church, JCC Manhattan and the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment, among others.           Dubbed \u0027America\u0027s Most Organized Man\u0027, rather surprisingly, Mellen began his life in the theater (which is hinted at by some of his book collection - nestled into the home design books) He worked as executive and artistic director at community-based arts organization DC Arts Center in the early 1990s, before moving to Seattle to work as a playwright, actor, producer and director at Alice B.

A tip is to remove the sheets and pillowcases from the dryer while they are still slightly damp and drape them over a shower rod to dry. It\u0027s the next best thing to ironing them, and they come out crisps and without wrinkles.          Art lines almost every wall in Andrew\u0027s apartment. His friends and family are artists and it is mainly there works which take pride of place. He practices Buddhism after dating a Zen monk for two years. This explains the nods to Buddha throughout the apartment. to the right of the dresser, in the  above picture next to the lamp, is an interesting object. It\u0027s an automatic watch winder for his kinetic watch. \u0027My watch is kinetic and I don\u0027t wear it all the time so this keeps it wound. I bought it off Amazon for approximately $40. It says much about Andrew\u0027s commitment to efficiency and not wasting time. Better to spend $40 than spend wasted minutes shaking the watch like most of us have to do EVERY time he goes to wear it.           Andrew calls drawers mini-closets on their sides. Like closets he recommends organizing them by type of clothing. The most important result of organizing your drawers is that \u0027you should be able to see the entire contents of each drawer easily as soon as you open it, as you can for your closets. A drawer should NOT be a crammed and jumbled mess of clothing.           Andrew even insists on keeping similar types of socks together. Thick socks, light socks etc. It\u0027s all fairly obvious advice, but seeing it in practice reminds one of how life becomes so much calmer and easier when things are in their place.           Andrew is all for photos from trips and travel but also believes \u0027people spend so much time documenting their excursions that the first time they actually experience being someplace different is when they get home and look back at photos taken and souvenirs gathered. By then, the experience is over and all you\u0027re left with are artifacts from history, albeit recent history. Put down the cameraand explore, experience, drink up the adventure while having the adventure\u0027.          The best way to strip back your closet and make sure it contains the things you actually use, Andrew recommends sitting down and deciding how many shirts you actually need, how many pairs of pants, shoes etc. If you decide on five long sleeve and five short sleeved shirts, make sure that when you buy a new shirt, get rid of an old one.  One of Andrew\u0027s tips for keeping a tidy closet and bedroom is returning those annoying wire hangers back to the dry cleaners for recycling, while keeping all of your hanging clothes on robust hangers. Couldn\u0027t agree more.  Belt and tie hooks make for easy visibility and reach. Andrew recommends also having a hook, an area or a chair where you can place clothes in \u0027purgatory\u0027 - \u0027the ones that aren\u0027t quite dirty but not quite clean, either. You\u0027d wear them again to run to the market or scrub the kitchen floor but maybe not for lunch  with your mother-in-law\u0027.  It was interesting to learn that Andrew has a housekeeper who also does his laundry and arranges his shirt, just as he requests: Short sleeves at one end, long sleeves at the other and color co-ordinated. Jeans and sweaters are folded and kept above. At first I thought the housekeeper surely means that it isn\u0027t Andrew who is Mr Organized, it\u0027s the staff. But, as Andrew says, it simply means he has more time for the valuable things in life. He knows how his home should be organized and he pays someone to do it. And she does a very good job.           Author Molly O\u0027Neill who sought the help of Andrew Mellen said he \u0027is efficient, no-nonsense, practical and persistent. He delivers order from chaos and he does it fast. I’m still not used to all the clean surfaces and orderly files and figuring out what to do with all the time and energy he’s saved me!\u0027          A sought-after authority on organizing and productivity, Andrew has addressed audiences from Dwell on Design and TEDx to The Great British Business Show and BlogHer\u0027You will always be able to find anything  - in your home or office, kitchen or car - within thirty seconds. You will never be late because you misplaced your keys. You will finally have the time to do the things you love to do. Or to discover the things you love. Or to rediscover them.\u0027What I do is guide you through a precise process that will enable you to unstuff your life of everything that doesn\u0027t serve you and shine a light on everything that does. How\u0027s that sound instead?\u0027Now, full disclosure: Mellen surprised me by revealing that he has a housekeeper. My first thought was surely that\u0027s cheating? The second was: She must have her work cut out. But as he explained, it\u0027s about time saving. He knows how he wants his home to look and how he wants it to make him feel. The fact he is paying someone to implement it simply means he has more free time to do the things he loves and focus on what he considers more valuable endeavors like building relationships with people, maintaining friendships and enjoying his work. You can, it turns out, still be America\u0027s most organized man and have a housekeeper to keep you organized.Dubbed \u0027America\u0027s Most Organized Man\u0027, rather surprisingly, Mellen began his life in the theater. He worked as executive and artistic director at community-based arts organization DC Arts Center in the early 1990s, before moving to Seattle to work as a playwright, actor, producer and director at Alice B. Theater.           \u0027I\u0027m not a minimalist, I\u0027m an essentialist\u0027, reveals Andrew. And he\u0027s no-nonsense too. Not only is he ruthless with his own belongings, but also gifts from other people. No way does he believe these things should clutter your home just because they were given as a present. \u0027Get rid of it as soon as possible. Any object that upon sight causes you pain, grief, regret, embarrassment or disappointment has no place in your life. Re-gift it\u0027.          Just because he espouses living simply and cleanly doesn\u0027t meant that Mellen shies away from color and pattern, as his quirky choice of chairs and artwork shows          Mellen takes inspiration from Buddhism and speaks frequently on the intersection of spirituality and organization at Omega Institute, San Francisco Zen Center, Tassajara, All Saints Church, JCC Manhattan and the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment, among others          Mellen believes clutter leads to an unhappy life, but what counts as clutter depends on the inidual. His vast collection of books, displayed in neat piles around his home, bring him happiness and therefore are not clutter          Mellen uses his apartment as a teaching tool for clients. Mellen leads workshops and speaks internationally while maintaining a private practice working with clients ranging from Fortune 100 companies, trade associations and non-profits to CEOs, filmmakers and authors, as well as overwhelmed parents everywhere          In 2013, Andrew founded Unstuff U®, the world\u0027s first virtual university dedicated to organization and decluttering, offering classes, workshops and other online resources for businesses and inidualsBut in 1996 he decided to take his career in a whole new direction. Following his passion for organization, he began working one-to-one with clients and multinational corporations including Goldman Sachs, American Express and Time, Inc. as a consultant for streamlining work, and keeping things simple.He also wrote a column for Real Simple (Ask the Organizer) and is still a frequent contributor for numerous news sources including Wall Street Journal, CNN Money and NPR, among others. Mellen also wrote best-selling book Unstuff Your Life! which includes his unique The Organizational Triangle®.This is a set of three simple rules to declutter 1: One home for everything, 2: Like with like, meaning similar objects should be stored together and 3: Something in, something out.   Andrew is also a member of the Experts Collective and serves on the faculty of the New York Open Center in New York City. He speaks frequently on the intersection of spirituality and organization at Omega Institute, San Francisco Zen Center, Tassajara, All Saints Church, JCC Manhattan and the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment, among others.           Dubbed \u0027America\u0027s Most Organized Man\u0027, rather surprisingly, Mellen began his life in the theater (which is hinted at by some of his book collection - nestled into the home design books) He worked as executive and artistic director at community-based arts organization DC Arts Center in the early 1990s, before moving to Seattle to work as a playwright, actor, producer and director at Alice B.

Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the chances of a decisive summit this month were receding with \u0027every day that passes\u0027.At a tense meeting of the Cabinet yesterday, Mrs May briefed ministers on compromise plans for the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 – the final stumbling block in negotiations with Brussels.At least seven Cabinet ministers warned the PM that the latest proposals, which concede that the UK will not be able to withdraw unilaterally from the arrangements to avoid a hard border between Norther Ireland and the Republic - may be a concession too far.Those raising concerns about the country being trapped indefinitely in a customs union included Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Gavin Williamson, Penny Mordaunt, Chris Grayling, Liz Truss and Jeremy Hunt.  But a crucial intervention was made by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. The eminent QC and strident Brexiteer is said to have told the gathering that a \u0027review\u0027 clause could be enough to give the UK an escape route.Mrs May told her ministers that a deal has to be struck this month if it is going to be implemented in time for the UK’s departure from the EU in March. They were warned Parliament is scheduled to sit for just 74 days before the UK leaves the EU, with a mass of legislation still to pass.

But the magic realist epic book sparked controversy upon its publication in 1988. Muslims accused it of blasphemy and mocking their faith, resulting in a fatwā calling for Rushdie\u0027s death issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989.  He called upon Muslims to kill not only Rushdie but also his editors and publishers. The result was several failed assassination attempts on Rushdie, who was placed under police protection by the UK government, and attacks on several connected iniduals such as translator Hitoshi Igarashi, who was stabbed to death at the University of Tsukuba in 1991 by an unknown assailant.Violent demonstrations ensued in Pakistan, copies of the novel were burned in Britain, where several bookstores were bombed and the work was banned in several countries.Lady Chatterley\u0027s Lover D.H. LawrencePenguin\u0027s 1960 publication of the original text of Lady Chatterley\u0027s Lover led to arguably the most famous trial in literary history when they had to prove the work had enough literary merit to warrant its explicit content under the obscenity law. Penguin won, with EM Forster defending it in court, and Lawrence\u0027s story of Lady Constance Chatterley and her affair with gamekeeper Mellors went on to sell three million copies in the three months after the trial.Animal Farm George Orwell Orwell\u0027s allegorical 1945 novel about the Soviet Union was banned in the USSR until the 1980s. Through the animal inhabitants of Manor Farm, Orwell criticised what he saw as a brutal dictatorship and reign of terror. Before it could be banned it was also rejected several times for publication, as it was written during the UK\u0027s wartime alliance with the Soviet Union. It was also temporarily banned in the UAE because of its talking pigs, seen to be against Islamic values.  Doctor ZhivagoBoris PasternakPasternak\u0027s depiction of Russian life after the Bolshevik Revolution was banned in the former Soviet Union until 1988. Such was the native hostility towards his book\u0027s apparent criticisms of the Bolshevik party that Pasternak turned down the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958 after being threatened with ejection from the USSR.The Wonderful Wizard of OzL Frank BaumThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) was banned in many US libraries and schools in the 1930s and again in the 1950s for promoting \u0027unwholesome\u0027 values via its independent female protagonist and its \u0027ungodly\u0027 characters such as witches and flying monkeys.LolitaVladimir NabikovThe story depicting a sexual relationship between a middle-aged man and a 12-year-old girl was published in 1955. The UK Home Office ordered British Customs officials to seize any copies entering the UK in a ban which lasted until 1959.

Mein KampfAdolf HitlerHitler\u0027s autobiography and manifesto sold millions of copies during the Nazi regime but was banned in Germany in 1945. It has been subjected to various bans across the world including Argentina, where its publication or import in significant numbers is illegal. It was not published in Poland until 1992.Harry Potter J K RowlingDespite more than 450 million copies of the Harry Potter series being sold around the globe, the first four books are the most banned books in America. Accused of promoting witchcraft and the occult, and labelled a \u0027masterpiece of satanic deception\u0027, the books have been banned and burned across the US, although many schools have stood firm against parental requests to remove the books from their libraries.  Beloved Toni Morrison Although it won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Morrison\u0027s story of an escaped slave named Sethe has been challenged again and again by parents when it is given as set reading in English lessons. The book\u0027s violence and sexual content have repeatedly provoked controversy and ten years after its publication it was entirely banned from English classes at a high school in Kentucky, and students from one Idaho district had to have parental permission to study it.The Canterbury Tales Geoffrey Chaucer Written at the end of the 14th century, Chaucer\u0027s collection of stories in Middle English has been banned, challenged and censored for centuries. The stories follow a group of pilgrims making up tales on their way to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket and are filled with sexual innuendo, swearing and perceived criticism of the church. It was censored widely on first publication and them under the 1873 Comstock Law it was banned from being posted in the US, with several modern editions still heavily edited for profanity.  Letters From Burma Aung San Suu Kyi This collection of essays from Nobel Peace Prize winner and current Burmese State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was banned in her native Burma while she was under house arrest for fifteen years, despite being widely available across the world. In these letters she paints a picture of her Burma from the impact of the political situation, to the people who have supported the National League for Democracy, to the landscape and customs of the country itself.The Fault in Our Stars John Green Despite being one of the biggest young adult sensations of recent years, Green\u0027s mega-bestseller was banned in a school district in California after a parent challenged it\u0027s \u0027morbid plot, crude language and sexual content\u0027 saying it wasn\u0027t appropriate for middle school aged children. Hazel and Gus\u0027 heartbreaking love story is only the second book to be banned in the district after Robert Cormier\u0027s 1974 novel The Chocolate War.  Not Without My Daughter Betty Mahmoody This is the true story of Betty Mahmoody who travelled to Iran from the US to meet her husband\u0027s family. Once there she realised that her husband and his family had always intended them to stay, and that she and her daughter were trapped with an increasingly violent man in a society where most women were treated as property. This account of her attempts to escape with her daughter was banned in Iran for its depiction of the patriarchal culture thereThe Complete Fairy Tales Brothers Grimm Although the Brothers Grimm were the collectors rather than the inventors of the fairy tales they published, they were still banned in Germany after the fall of the Nazis. The collection was banned by the Allies who claimed the roots of Nazism could be found in the stories particularly citing the way the Nazis used Little Red Riding Hood as a symbol of the German people being saved from the Jewish wolf.  The Well of Loneliness Radclyffe Hall Hall\u0027s lesbian romance was the subject of an obscenity trial despite featuring no explicit or erotic scenes. The story follows an upper-class woman who falls in love with a female ambulance driver during World War One, but is rejected by her family and society because of the relationship. The campaign against it was spearheaded by the then-editor of the Sunday Express and a British court judged it obscene for its \u0027unnatural practises between women\u0027. In 1949 it was republished without challenge and has been in print continuously since.The Witches (Colour Edition) Roald Dahl, illustration by Quentin Blake Dahl\u0027s beloved but dark tale of witches living in disguise as normal women has been challenged consistently since it was published in 1983, primarily in the US. Criticisms against it include not teaching moral values (Iowa in 1987), turning children towards the occult (Dallas in 1991) and satanic themes (Ohio in 1998).

Her father was a member of the Holy See police force. Rome\u0027s chief prosecutor has been called in to investigate the find.  One theory suggests she was kidnapped by hostage-takers trying to have Mehmet Ali Agca, who shot the Pope in St Peter\u0027s Square in 1981, freed from prison.Shortly after she disappeared the police are claimed to have received anonymous calls, which said Emanuela would be freed if the Turkish gunman was released. Forensic investigators are working to determine the age of the bones as well as the date of death.The Rome embassy is in the upscale residential neighborhood of Parioli, near the city\u0027s Villa Borghese museum.      Protesters  hold posters with Emanuela Orlandi\u0027s image calling for \u0027truth and justice\u0027 for the 15-year-old who vanished in 1983, in a demonstration in St Peter\u0027s Square in 2012The last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Emanuela\u0027s remains too. However, that search turned up no link.More recently, a leading Italian investigative journalist caused a sensation when he published a five-page document last year that had been stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See had been involved in Orlandi\u0027s disappearance. The Vatican immediately branded the document a fake, though it never explained what it was doing in the Vatican cabinet.The document was purportedly written by a cardinal and listed supposed expenses used for Orlandi\u0027s upkeep after she disappeared. The Vatican has repeatedly maintained that it has co-operated fully with police investigating the Orlandi case.Vatican Orlandi mystery: \u0027Woman\u0027s bones\u0027 found in Rome search - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Ryanair flight Gdansk Poland Dublin declares emergency","story":"    Online trackers show the flight, which left Poland at 11.10am for a scheduled 12.50 landing in Dublin moving towards the airport in north-east England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a793c7cd241509bd90709700d4673ff76947d7cf/0_0_5803_4379/master/5803.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bb1c1e06915fab958d4fcdeec83e2d56 1320w","title":"enigma variations andrew aciman review call me by your name","story":"The author of the gay cult classic Call Me By Your Name explores one man’s life through his erotic fixationsHere is a novel that delivers on its title: these variations on a theme do amount to an enigma. André Aciman is a multilingual American writer and academic who grew up in Egypt, France and Italy, and is best known for Call Me By Your Name, the 2007 debut that became a bestseller and a successful film a decade after publication. Pronounced an instant gay classic, it tells the story of an affair between a teenage boy and a more experienced man. All temptation and devastation over one hot Italian summer, it’s a narrative that appeals across the generations.The Enigma Variations’ storyline is more blurred. Structured around five loosely linked sections that vary in length from novella to short story, this episodic work jumps in time, tense and place, each section exploring a different erotic fixation. Its anchor is the narrator, Paul, and at heart this is simply a depiction of one man’s history through his love life.The longest and most significant section, First Love, is immediately reminiscent of Call Me By Your Name. We are in deeply familiar Aciman territory: a boy’s groin-aching longing for a man, sultry Italian weather and early love’s lifelong shaping of the psyche. The young Paul – his portrait scant on biographical fact, fully revelatory on the ways of the heart and libido – has spent his summers with his parents on an Italian island, and has returned 10 years later. “I’ve come back for him,” he says.The object of desire is Ascanius, known as Nanni, a cabinet maker who has worked for Paul’s parents and failed to settle down with “one of those beefy, unshorn town girls”. Pubescent Paul develops an infatuation with this young man that is “unusual and stealthy, possibly unwholesome”, and slowly insinuates his way into his workshop to help out. A torment of unfulfilled desire results.A thumping great daddy complex runs through this story, which is heavy with Freudian implications at every turn. “I wanted to be Ascanius. I wanted him to be my father, I wanted to leave and walk away with him.” In the present, Nanni has disappeared and Paul is now left with his memory, but also, in a jaw-dropping revelation, with the discovery of the real focus of his hero’s passions.As ever, Aciman’s evocation of weather, emotional subtlety and time passing is wonderful. The narrative moves seamlessly into earlier years: the past is the present, the present the past. This Proustian meander captures truths about the contradictory drives of romantic love, but the pace can be excruciatingly slow, and the lack of any real knowledge of who or what Paul is creates a constant sensation of something missing.The next section, Spring Fever, makes a tonal leap, and could almost be the work of another writer. It is a sharper, more modern, present-tense urban tale. The adult Paul is living in New York with a woman called Maud. He spots her in a restaurant with a companion and his jealousy becomes overwhelming. The story revolves around a dinner party, and the build-up of Paul’s pain is affecting, the ambling plot lifting towards another great twist – Aciman is a master of these. The existence of a handsome tennis player has been cunningly inserted in Spring Fever, and the character becomes central to the next chapter.This is a man – called Manfred, in case we miss the fact that he’s a man. The slow, obsessive falling in love, the problems caused by Paul’s desires and ultimate betrayal, drive a lust-filled meditation containing echoes of Proust and of Elgar’s music. There is little actual sex in these tales of desire: most of the action takes place in the narrator’s mind. As Paul says: “God only knows what I would have invented once seized by the urge to touch another human being.”The complete lack of attention paid to Paul’s sexual orientation is refreshingly contemporary. Desire is all, categorisation redundant. The final two sections revolve around an on-off affair with a married woman met in youth, and an all-consuming email affair with a much younger writer. Love is unattainable, thwarted, never quite fulfilled.The absence of a conventional sense of story or structure reflects the musical form that Aciman is invoking, making this a clever experiment but also a frustrating one. For all its author’s indisputable talents, Enigma Variations creates, deliberately or otherwise, a sense of unfinished business.• Joanna Briscoe’s latest novel Touched is published by Arrow.

He is a liberal talk-show host operating in a field bursting with bloviating rightwingers who love nothing more than to hear their own opinions parroted back at them by callers. On his phone-in show on LBC – the station that also employs Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and, until May of last year, Katie Hopkins – O’Brien has become the de facto spokesperson for scores of Britons frustrated by the isiveness and fury of contemporary politics.You don’t even need to tune in to hear him holding forth on the major stories of the day, since clips of him delivering wearily heartfelt monologues on such topics as the Hillsborough inquiry, the murder of Jo Cox or how the NHS is being sold off under our noses have become a fixture across social media platforms. Equally compelling are his conversations with callers who, in their attempts to school him on topics such as immigration or the iniquities of the EU, often end up with the verbal equivalent of a bloody nose. Taken in isolation, these excerpts can look like demolition jobs in which O’Brien exposes their ignorance in front of the nation, a situation that has no doubt spurred him to write How to Be Right. As well as sharing his thoughts on the state of the world, the book offers context on why he does what he does and why others think the way they do.“I have probably had more opportunities to hear from ordinary people over the last few years than almost anyone else on the planet,” he writes, which seems an extravagant claim until you realise that O’Brien, who began his journalistic career as the showbiz editor at the , spends three hours a day, five days a week, talking to callers about their political concerns. The book is neatly ided into chapters that cover the subjects most frequently raised, among them political correctness, Islam and Islamism, Brexit, Trump, the age gap and feminism. Within these chapters, O’Brien includes transcriptions of on-air conversations with his callers, around which he wraps informed, sharply articulated analysis.The title is somewhat misleading since it suggests that O’Brien’s focus is less on listening than winning the argument. This is a notion from which he is keen to distance himself, however, since, on more than one occasion, he grumbles about being accused of condescension. His willingness to engage with alternative points of view is partly down to his conviction that people should be able to justify their positions, but also because such exchanges provide a tantalising opportunity for him to replace fallacy with fact.And so we are introduced to Andy from Nottingham, a leave voter who called to say that Brexit would allow Britain to “control our own laws”. Pressed to name precisely which laws, all he could come up with was a quip about the shape of bananas before admitting that he couldn’t name a single edict imposed by the EU that had negatively affected his life. We also meet David, a lay preacher who called in after the Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron described gay sex as a sin. O’Brien wanted David, who believed the Bible told us all we needed to know about homosexuality, to enlighten him on Jesus’s views but David kept quoting Corinthians. “First Corinthians is a letter that St Paul wrote,” explained O’Brien, before saying again: “What did Jesus say, in the Gospels, about homosexuality?” By the end he had asked the question 27 times, at one stage breaking into song in mock-frustration, but to no avail. This is because Jesus said nothing on the subject at all.O’Brien is an exceptional broadcaster with a peerless ability to calmly point out the absurdity of certain viewpoints, a quality which similarly runs through this book. Much time is spent explaining how his callers have arrived at their views, placing the blame largely at the door of the scaremongering and toxic propaganda of the rightwing media, and a political discourse in which xenophobic language and erroneous claims of fake news often go unchallenged. Still, his clarity of thought – his confidence and absolute conviction that he is on the side of goodness and truth – is something to behold. As O’Brien admits, “you need at least a slightly overdeveloped ego to do the job”. Thus the most illuminating parts of How to Be Right arrive in his rare moments of uncertainty. A case in point comes in the chapter about feminism, in which he reveals with startling honesty how one of his callers, a City lawyer named Fiona, helped him understand how men can subtly diminish women with personal remarks, and “how behaviour I once considered utterly normal could be experienced as sexually aggressive”. O’Brien’s path to understanding has, he says, “been the hardest to arrive at. It remains a work in progress.”For all its qualities, a nagging question remains about who this book is for. It’s unlikely that, for instance, Andy would read it when he can simply vent his spleen on air to O’Brien instead. Meanwhile, the broadcaster’s many cheerleaders can find daily sustenance by listening to his show, or by viewing clips on social media. One suspects that O’Brien has a more detailed and scholarly book in him that could dig deeper into where we are politically, if only the unfolding disaster movie that is the news would allow him time to do so.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Sometimes good books can be found in unusual places, as tommydog shows:I was up in the mountains fishing and on the cabin’s bookshelf was We Pointed Them North: Recollections of a Cow Puncher by EOC Abbott, aka Teddy Blue Abbott. It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy’s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun…It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example).Astonishing. Just in case you were wondering, here’s a definition of “cowpuncher”. (It isn’t someone who goes around thumping cows.)On the subject of frontiers, Dennis89 has been “thoroughly enjoying” The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard:A monumental account of Scott’s tragic 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Since starting this book I feel that my concentration at work has waned... My thoughts keep ferrying me off to the wonder, beauty and isolation of Antarctica. I walk home from work eager to get back into that world of crevasses, comradeship, endeavour and altruism. Yes, there are the formidable details of the journeys undertaken and the conditions experienced but the real joy lies within the description of the human relationships that are formed in such a hostile and unforgiving environment.But humans aren’t always so noble. William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace:Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don’t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon’s corpse reminded me the description of Curly’s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I’m glad happened now and not in my school days.The Portable Dorothy Parker, “a collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence” has impressed JohnHunt:Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages … Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she’s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman’s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who’s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide.Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you’re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can’t go wrong.Anna Burns’ Milkman has worked for chasm:I’m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable.Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister’s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris:Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs.Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray’s Vanity Fair:The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: “At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived. Warriors may fight and perish, but he must dine.”If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.The search for a new chairman comes at a challenging time for the employee-owned business. Profits have fallen amid rising costs and a structural shift in the market towards online shopping during which troubled rivals closed stores or offered more discounts.Mayfield’s departure had been expected internally. The company’s constitution states that a chairman’s tenure can be renewed for three years after the first 10, but is only likely to be extended further in exceptional circumstances.Mayfield said: “Although my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. It is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership.”The process for selecting the partnership’s fifth chairman will be overseen by a committee made up of two elected directors, two independent non-executive directors, and Mayfield. The committee is chaired by Keith Williams, the deputy chairman, and supported by independent recruitment consultants.The new chair will be announced in the second half of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3beceb2842f644ad0e9ea1232a25e109e03067f1/0_308_4788_2872/master/4788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90892d542a4fab361f6776e80932165b","title":"wanted radical economist boost uk economy cash prize 150000 pounds ippr","story":"IPPR launches world’s third biggest economics prize looking to restart UK growthOne of the biggest cash prizes in world economics has been launched to find “radical ideas” to reinvigorate the British economy.Launched against a backdrop of deep public distrust in politicians to revitalise the UK economy, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank has lined up an £150,000 prize fund to uncover fresh ideas.It comes after growth figures revealed at the budget show economic growth in Britain has dropped to among the lowest levels in the G7, while inequality has risen and there are growing pressures on the environment.Believed to be the third-biggest prize in international economics, the new IPPR prize will reward policy solutions to tackle these problems, while forcing a “step change in the quality and quantity of the UK’s economic growth.”It will include a single main prize of £100,000, placing it among the most lucrative prizes in the economics profession after the 9m Swedish krona (£760,455) Nobel award from the Swedish central bank and the £250,000 Wolfson prize, which was launched in 2011 by the Tory peer and Next chief executive Simon Wolfson.The IPPR economics prize – supported by the prominent Labour donor and Brexit campaigner John Mills – will also have a dedicated under-25s prize worth £25,000, and a runners-up prize pot of £25,000.“We are falling further behind every year. Our productivity is poor, levels of investment are meagre, and we cannot pay our way in the world,” he added.According to opinion polling on the economy commissioned by the IPPR, almost four fifths of Britons would describe the current crop of “leading politicians” from across the political ide as stale and unimaginative.Fewer than a quarter of people in the poll, which was conducted from more than 1,400 Sky customers, said they were confident that the government could come up with new ideas required to boost economic growth.Although launched by the centre-left IPPR, the winner of the new economics prize will be selected by a panel of senior business leaders and economists, chaired by Stephanie Flanders, the head of economics at Bloomberg.Mills will sit on the panel, alongside other judges including Helena Morrissey, the prominent City fund manager, Shriti Vadera, the chair of Santander UK, and John Eatwell, who is president of Queen’s College, Cambridge.It comes after the IPPR’s commission on economic justice, which included Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, called for a far-reaching and radical revamp of the UK economy to raise the standard of living of millions of workers.With a deadline of 6 January 2019, entrants for the economics prize will be asked to answer the question: “What would be your radical plan to force a step change in the quality and quantity of the UK’s economic growth?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd8b129e18b29ae4e4c9c5f9043e57816b7cf750/0_37_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3052790794b9e80bdebef9ba627542aa","title":"us dollar shares markets gridlock elections business live","story":"Gridlock on Capitol Hill reduces chance of further fiscal stimulus and tax cuts, economists sayPolitical gridlock also means there’s little chance that Donald Trump’s original tax reforms are reversed.Democrats on the Hill might want to repeal those tax cuts, but the Republican-controlled Senate surely won’t allow it. Financial markets are expected to take comfort with the split power in Congress: it was widely expected and will be perceived to allow for additional checks and balances on President Trump. The decent election results for Republicans in the Senate should lessen perceptions of a shift to the hard-left in the 2020 elections and ease concerns about a roll-back of pro-business policies.They also believe we’ll see a lot more political rancour in Congress, but rather less meaningful legislation:We expect even more Congressional dysfunction ‑ if that is possible ‑ to lead to more convolutions in the already dysfunctional budget process and more threats of government shutdowns.Just in: The MSCI All-Country World Share Index, which tracks global stocks, has hit its highest level since 22 October.Paras Anand of Fidelity International has an optimistic take - Donald Trump could work with the Democrat-controlled House to push through a new infrastructure-spending package.During the 2016 Clinton election campaign, infrastructure spend was high on the Democrat’s policy agenda (as it was for Trump). It is possible that with a bi-partisan focus on the pent-up need for domestic infrastructure investment, the Democrat view on the budget deficit may change from opposition (to tax cuts) to accommodation (spending on roads, hospitals, airports).“Any development in this direction would further spur the overall economy, continue to push wages in an already tight labour market, and potentially challenge the current expectations around the Federal Reserve’s activity for next year. Most political events have an underwhelming economic impact - could the US midterms prove the exception?”The outcome of the US midterms has been met with relief by financial markets. says Silvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management.However, it may not last long..Equities and bonds rallied, while the US dollar weakened. Following the correction in equities markets in October, the lift of the uncertainty surrounding the US mid-term elections paves the way for a solid performance of financial markets into year-end.But that could change in 2019 as fundamentals look less supportive and prospects are more uncertain.She also reckons Donald Trump will face a tougher task getting reelected in 2020, as a Democrat-controlled House may launch new probes into the president:The most significant consequences of the US mid-term elections concern the domestic political landscape. Indeed, a ided Congress means President Trump will have a hard time to get his domestic policies approved in particular, his promised new round of tax cuts will probably never see the light.In addition, Democrats controlling the House will probably use subpoena powers to widen investigation into issues such as Russian interferences in the 2016 elections. All this will make for a challenging environment for President Trump to operate in, lowering his chances of winning a second term in 2020. In the run-up to this week’s elections, Donald Trump floated the idea of a new tax cut for America.The idea looked highly speculative at the time, and has now been washed away by the Blue Wave of votes for Democratic candidates.Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says the tax cut simply won’t happen. That’s good for US fiscal stability, and means Treasury bonds are rallying today (a tax cut would widen the deficit, meaning more government borrowing).If Donald Trump doesn’t play ball with Congress, America could find itself facing another government shutdown.So warns Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics.He told clients this morning the risk of a shutdown has risen.Trump has issued plenty of threats to shutter the government in order to extract funding for his border wall or to rein in non-defence spending, and the risks are surely higher now that he can blame the Democrats. The first flashpoint could come in early December, Hunter explains, when the current government funding bill is due to expire. The big clash could arrive in early 2019, if Congress can’t agree to raise the debt ceiling.The big risk would be a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling when the current suspension expires next spring, which would raise the possibility of a “technical” default. Mike Dolan of Reuters has created a neat chart, showing how asset prices have moved since America went to the polling booths yesterday.As you can see, global stock markets (in yellow) are higher, as are European shares (green) and most emerging market currencies (in orange).The dollar (blue) and US bond yields (red) are both down since Tuesday morning.This chart shows how the US dollar is the clear loser in the financial markets today, dropping against all major rivals:With Democrats winning the House of Representatives majority and Republicans clinching control of the Senate, President Donald Trump’s party loses full control of Congress.The results dim chances for any major fiscal initiative from the administration that might have triggered yield gains and hence a stronger greenback.They’re benefitting from the weaker dollar, explains Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell:“A decline in the dollar following the US midterm elections has given a welcome boost to the mining sector as it will be cheaper for many foreign companies to buy dollar-denominated commodities.There’s also some optimism that Donald Trump might show us the Art of the Deal, and reach a trade agreement with China soon.Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, argues that the White House will want to boast about another win soon:It may be that Trump adopts a softer stance in an attempt to get a deal on trade, thus allowing him to proclaim that he has ‘solved’ the China trade issue ahead of his 2020 re-election campaign.You can keep track of all the midterm election results here:Here are five lessons for investors from the midterm elections, from Neil Wilson of Markets:Aaron Anderson, senior vice-president for research at wealth manager Fisher Investments, argues that the prospect of political gridlock is actually good for shares.Legislation was hardly flying through Congress before midterms. Now with Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, the GOP increasing its majority in the Senate and President Trump in the White House, it will be nearly impossible to pass anything remotely controversial.That will drive many people crazy, but markets love it. We should now have a long stretch where political risks go way down, which should be good for stocks.”Shares are roaring ahead in early trading in Europe, as investors react to the midterm election results.Some traders are concluding that gridlock on Capitol Hill could actually be good for America, if it stops Donald Trump driving up the US deficit.Simon French, chief economist at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, argues that the midterm result is “as good as you could hope”.Having the president’s wings clipped by losing control of the House is helpful for avoiding the most obvious “end of cycle policy mistakes” - which in our view is pumping more deficit spending and protectionism into the economy, forcing the Fed to tighten at a faster rate.With the US dollar weakening fast, the pound has gained half a cent to $1.314 - a three week high.The euro has been lifted to a two-week high, at $1.147.Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says the prospect of Trump and Congress acting like “bickering inmates” for the next two years is hurting the US dollar.“Nevertheless, domestic political unrest may throw a ner in the works for the dollar, as Trump’s relations with the Democrats will be essential in the coming months to determine the course of politics.Potentially Trump, who was once a member of the Democratic Party, may manage to come together with the Democrats and agree on broad tax cuts for the middle class. This could be a boost for the economy and the dollar, assuming markets don’t start to fret about the increasing government deficit. Chances are higher that the Democrats will seize the opportunity to use their new control of certain commissions in the House to step up the investigations in Trump’s tax dealings, relations with Russia and claims of hush money payments.The menacing club of government shutdowns will be the Democrats’ to yield every time Trump goes too far out of line to their taste in the coming months. The dollar may, in the end, get the biggest whack from this.”Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.The US dollar is in retreat this morning after the Democrats won control of America’s House of Representatives in a gripping night of election drama.The midterm elections saw a Blue Wave sweep through Congress’s lower chamber, giving the Democratic party fresh power to control president Trump. Checks and balances are back -- although the Republicans did put up a better show in the Senate races, increasing their majority.My colleague David Smith reports from Washington:“We rebuked Trump and Trumpism at a critical moment,” Ilya Sheyman, executive director of the grassroots organisation MoveOn wrote in a celebratory email.Many Democrats will be tempted to see the glass as half empty, engaging in self-flagellation over narrow defeats for some of its rising stars and a worse-than-expected loss of ground in the Senate. But the truth is that in the face of gerrymandering, voter suppression and an economy that continues to stay in the strong shape that Barack Obama bequeathed, the party reclaimed the House majority for the first time in eight years. That is no small achievement.Opinion polls had predicted that the Democrats would have a good night, so these results shouldn’t shake the financial markets.Investors are calculating that there will now be gridlock on Capitol Hill the House will be free to oppose Trump policies which Democrats don’t agree with. This could prevent the White House forcing tax cuts and new spending on infrastructure such as transport and water systems.So if Trump can’t give the US economy another jolt of fiscal stimulus, the economy may slow...meaning US interest rates might not rise as fast as feared.James Knightley, economist at ING, says president Trump will be feeling blue this morning:While not a great outcome for President Trump, it could have been worse. He clearly had plans to press on with infrastructure spending and further tax reform in the second half of his presidential term and while the policies are not dead, they are likely going to be curtailed or heavily revised by a Democrat-controlled House. Bi-partisanship will be required for progress to be made and for President Trump to generate a strong platform to defend his Presidency in 2020.However, the US economy will face an increasing number of challenges over the next couple of years as support fades from the fiscal stimulus and weaker global growth (contributed to by President Trump’s trade protectionism), a stronger dollar and higher interest rates provide increasing headwinds. A weaker economy and potentially falling asset prices and household wealth would compound the problems for President Trump.We’ll be mopping up financial reaction through the day.

It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”.His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts”. In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems – and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths – I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect.For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action.You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife film-makers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know – and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it – that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world that persuades us all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it.What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it.Since 1985, when I worked in the department that has made most of his programmes, I have pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995 I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to get environment off this fucking channel. Why the fuck are you bringing me environment?’”I later discovered that this response was typical. The controllers weren’t indifferent. They were actively hostile. If you ask me whether the BBC or ExxonMobil has done more to frustrate environmental action in this country, I would say the BBC.We all knew that only one person had the power to break this dam. For decades David Attenborough, a former channel controller widely seen as the living embodiment of the BBC, has been able to make any programme he wants. So where, we kept asking, was he? At last, in 2000, he presented an environmental series: State of the Planet.It was an interesting and watchable series, but it left us with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Only in the last few seconds of the final episode was there a hint that structural forces might be at play: “Real success can only come if there’s a change in our societies, in our economics and in our politics.” But what change? What economics? What politics? He had given us no clues.To make matters worse, it was sandwiched between further programmes of his about the wonders of nature, which created a strong impression of robust planetary health. He might have been describing two different worlds. Six years later he made another environmental series, The Truth About Climate Change. And this, in my view, was a total disaster.It told us nothing about the driving forces behind climate breakdown. The only mention of fossil fuel companies was as part of the solution: “The people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back underground.” Apart from the general “we”, the only distinct force identified as responsible was the “1.3 billion Chinese”. That a large proportion of Chinese emissions are caused by manufacturing goods the west buys was not mentioned. The series immediately triggered a new form of climate denial: I was bombarded with people telling me there was no point in taking action in Britain because the Chinese were killing the planet.If Attenborough’s environmentalism has a coherent theme, it is shifting the blame from powerful forces on to either society in general or the poor and weak. Sometimes it becomes pretty dark. In 2013 he told the  “What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about? They’re about too many people for too little land … We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.”There had not been a famine in Ethiopia for 28 years, and the last one was caused not by an absolute food shortage but by civil war and government policies. His suggestion that food relief is counter-productive suggests he has read nothing on the subject since Thomas Malthus’s essay in 1798. But, cruel and ignorant as these comments were, they were more or less cost-free. By contrast, you do not remain a national treasure by upsetting powerful vested interests: look at the flak the outspoken wildlife and environmental presenter Chris Packham attracts for standing up to the hunting lobby.I have always been entranced by Attenborough’s wildlife programmes, but astonished by his consistent failure to mount a coherent, truthful and effective defence of the living world he loves. His revelation of the wonders of nature has been a great public service. But withholding the knowledge we need to defend it is, I believe, a grave disservice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fb69ead56ff7bec2bf9e5242c20c3ee12ea57e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4e214e7497fdd20308b5547bed2536","title":"shakespeare help british muslims excluded","story":"A new interpretation of Othello opens up portrayals of Islam that are absent from TV shows like BodyguardAn Islamic prayer mat and a secret Muslim tragic-hero uttering “Ya Akbar” aren’t typically associated with Shakespeare, but Othello has been given a dramatic twist in a new touring production that illustrates the complexities of identity in modern Britain. A co-production involving English Touring Theatre, Oxford Playhouse and Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory, the play is on tour across the UK including in some of its more deprived areas, such as Oldham and Huddersfield. At a time when fictional portrayals of Muslims often suffer from reductionist stereotypes – as in the BBC’s Bodyguard, which had a Muslim woman as a jihadi terrorist – this new interpretation offers a powerfully nuanced message of belonging, and takes account of the centuries-long history of relations between England and the Muslim world.The Moor of Venice was first produced in 1604, a year after Elizabeth I’s reign ended. She had sought an alliance with the Ottoman empire against Catholic Spain – opening up diplomatic, political, economic and cultural exchange – with ambassadors from Morocco visiting the Elizabethan court. So the play’s timing could not have been pure coincidence. Professor Jerry Brotton, in his book This Orient Isle: Elizabethan England and the Islamic World notes: “This story is part of the heritage of Christians, Muslims and any others who call themselves English.”With attitudes this ambivalent, Shakespeare’s play could feel chillingly prophetic.When the contemporary backdrop is one of rising nationalism and populism, tensions over immigration, struggling religious minorities, and such movements as Black Lives Matter, Othello, from a certain perspective, holds startling parallels. In this new production, Othello is a black Muslim general, hiding his faith to assimilate, and fighting on behalf of the white colonial Christian state whose citizens regard him with conflicting views (“devil” “valiant Moor”). This mirrors the modern notion that even the “good” or “worthy” immigrant can never wholly belong.Then there is Iago, the villain who deceives Othello about his wife Desdemona’s fidelity and brings about a psychological downfall built on paranoia. Read: Iago is the fake news that feeds racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia – infiltrating minds and turning us on our own humanity.The play’s identity politics, cultural assimilation and Muslim dimension are not just concocted to look woke, these themes have been in Shakespeare all along. Richard Twyman, the production’s artistic director, says he was struck by the word “Moor”, which, in Shakespeare’s day, was synonomous with “Muslim”. “It urges you to view the play with a certain lens – it makes us aware of many of the issues we see in society today reflected back to us through Shakespeare’s words.”What is crucial to remember is that the relationship between Islam and Britain, although complex, goes much further back than modern history. How uplifting that Twyman wants Muslims to see themselves in Shakespeare. We can only hope that this unique and arguably more authentic approach to Shakespeare may serve to help Muslims to feel less isolated.Now, as then, there is an urgency for all of us to explore themes of masculinity, power, feminism, misogyny, race, and identity – political, spiritual and cultural. The Othello Project, accompanying the play, proposes to do just that. Supported by Amal, a programme of the Said Foundation, the project documents creative responses to the play from visual artists and spoken word poets, while journalists debate the themes in a series of podcasts that feature local voices in the communities of each toured city.Such artistic reinventions are vital to challenging the prejudices surrounding Muslims or indeed any minority. Othello conveys what it means to be British, what it’s like to carry multiple identities, where society stands and where it might be heading. With more productions like this, making sense of who we really are can be a more exciting, representative and relevant story.• Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c555b01b6c8f21124bca393d582e629c4a41599/81_173_4726_2835/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f203e22901ac1fb560a9d4dc496381","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

He called on the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, to dismiss him.Scruton was last week appointed by Brokenshire to chair the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission, an unpaid job on a new body, which aims to promote a design and style of homes that “reflect what communities want”.The Conservative philosopher is a frequent visitor to Hungary and says he has known its nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, since 1987. In 2014, he gave a lecture in the country, which referred to Soros, Judaism and Islam.“Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish, and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros empire,” Scruton wrote in a lecture entitled The Need for Nations, which is reproduced in Hungarian and English on his website.Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party has run a number of campaigns against the supposed threat to Hungary and Europe posed by Soros. These have accused him of funding a “Soros plan” to erase national identities and increase migration flows to Europe. Last month, an institution Soros helped found, the Central European University, said it would leave the country.Scruton’s lecture acknowledged that antisemitism was a problem in modern Hungary. It read: “Moreover, as the world knows, indigenous antisemitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics, and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews.”The lecture, first picked up by the Red Roar website, also argued that the nation-state is a Christian, European construct, which explained why a country such as Pakistan was a “failure”. Focusing on Islam, Scruton wrote: “The same is true of many other countries in which Islam is the dominant faith. Even if such countries do function as states, like Pakistan, they are often failures as nations.”Scruton’s observations about Soros are not isolated. The philosopher used an article in the Daily  in February 2018 to discuss sovereignty and Brexit, and whether leave or remain factions “has the nation at heart”.In the article, he referred to Best for Britain, a pro-remain campaign, which has accepted donations from Soros. It said: “And even if it accepts donations from George Soros, whose behaviour in Hungary, Albania and the Balkan states has been inspired at every stage by a visceral hostility to the national idea, this does not affect the issue.“It is possible that this man, whose currency speculation once almost bankrupted our country, is as devoted to the British national interest as is Gina Miller.”When asked about Scruton’s comments about Soros, the department of communities said: “Due diligence was carried out prior to Sir Roger Scruton’s appointment as chair.”A spokesman added: “Professor Sir Roger Scruton, as a long-standing public intellectual, has strong views on a number of issues. He received a knighthood in 2016 and advised the coalition government on design. “His commitment to driving quality in the built environment is well known and he has published extensively on architecture and place, which makes him an excellent candidate for the unpaid chairmanship of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission.”Scruton did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/151e17e7b86d8fed14abcaf0f7bc5110a5c7c490/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7bb63ea64c50fec4c2caf25c7069ea6","title":"under wraps the rise of the blanket scarf","story":"The autumnwinter catwalks had the trend for oversized scarves well covered. How did it become cool to be swaddled?It has been six years since Lenny Kravitz launched a million memes with his gigantic scarf. This autumn, his neckwear looks a little less daft: the blanket-scarf trend has gone big.Cardi B was one of the first to nail it, wearing a purple blanket boldly decorated with a picture of her own face in lieu of a coat to traverse the concourse at LAX airport earlier this year – the perfect accessory for a celebrity hiding in plain sight.On the autumnwinter catwalks, models also kept things well covered. At Acne Studios, there were scarves to rival even Kravitz’s, harnessed in coat waistbands – handy to stop them getting trapped in bus doors. Isabel Marant paired her blanket scarves with cowboy boots for a western twang, while Jil Sander was a more tailored expression of the trend.Big scarves and blanket scarves tie into the trend for all things oversized, from totes to coats, but they also have a practical point, as a removable layer to stay warm. A happy byproduct is the additional space for logos, which continued to hold their ground on the autumnwinter catwalks. At Acne Studios, scarves the size of bedspreads are decorated with the brand’s signature stamp.The current crop are, she says, “similar in style and texture to those of 50s America”. Early in that decade, oversized scarves were often made from brightly coloured mohair, while in the latter half “fashion adopted the stripes and plaids of traditional cowboy workwear, ponchos, and the brighter chevrons of the Navajo Indians, who wore blankets as decorative but functional layers.”Could the garment’s popularity be read as symbolic? “From the moment we’re born, we’re wrapped in a blanket,” says Rebecca Kramer, the founder of the ethical luxury knitwear brand Aessai, which sells its handwoven scarves at The Conran Shop and Browns Fashion. “They are a symbol of comfort and warmth, and an expression of different cultures.”In light of the craft renaissance, championed perhaps most enthusiastically by the Loewe designer JW Anderson, the blanket resurgence fits a pattern. For Kramer, part of the inspiration for Aessai came from weaving, a symbolic practice in the area of rural Argentina where she grew up, “done with respect for, and inspired by, the environment”.Chelsea Power, a buyer at matchesfashion, links blanket scarves to the integrated way we now see fashion and furnishings, pointing to “this idea is that your clothes, your home and your lifestyle should all sync. People are starting to dress their homes as they would themselves.” It can’t hurt, she adds, that “there is no one saying that a blanket can’t be a shawl”. These days, it’s cool to be swaddled.

This deliciously squidgy, zesty recipe will convince all but the most diehard fruitcake denier. Like many of us, it only improves with age and the judicious application of small amounts of strong liquor.Prep 45 min + soaking and maturingCook 90-110 minServes 10-12250g currants250g sultanas100g dried figs, roughly chopped100g glace cherries, cut in half100g mixed peel125ml whisky, plus extra to feed (or cold black tea or fruit juice)125g butter, softened125g muscovado sugar4 eggs, beaten130g plain flour½ tsp baking powder1 tsp mixed spice50g ground almondsSaltGrated zest of 1 lemon50g whole almonds, roughly chopped25g crystallised ginger, chopped (optional)To ice (optional)5 tbsp smooth jam (apricot is the classic choice)450g marzipan Icing sugar, to dust450g ready-to-roll icingA note about ingredients: those listed are my preferred mix of dried fruit and nuts, but fruitcake is a very personal thing, so feel free to substitute your own blend –sour cherries or cranberries instead of glace fruit chopped dates or apricots instead of figs a simple bag of supermarket mixed fruit – so long as you keep the total weight the same.Many people claim they don’t like fruitcake because it’s dry. Avoid this by soaking the dried fruit and peel in either whisky (or cold tea or fruit juice, if you’d prefer to keep your cake teetotal). Cover and leave to steep for six to 12 hours – I usually do this the night before I’m planning to bake.Grease and line a 20cm springform cake tin with two layers of baking paper: this may seem unnecessarily fiddly, but it will prevent the outer layers from burning – very handy when you’re baking with dried fruit, which has a tendency to catch and become very bitter where it sticks out from the sides of the cake.Heat the oven to 160C325Fgas 2½. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and cream together until very light and fluffy I’d recommend using electric beaters for at least five minutes until it has significantly increased in volume. Gradually add the eggs, beating well between each addition so the mix doesn’t curdle.Sift the flour into another large bowl, then whisk in the baking powder, spice, ground almonds and a pinch of salt. If you’re not a fan of mixed spice, or don’t have it to hand, you can substitute vanilla extract or other sweet spices, though bear in mind that the likes of nutmeg and cardamom are very strong, so go easy with them.Fold these dry ingredients into the butter and sugar mixture, along with the soaked fruits and any remaining soaking liquid, lemon zest, chopped almonds (again, use other nuts or leave them out if you prefer) and ginger, if using. You can leave it out if you like, but it does give the cake a lovely burst of heat.Gently tip into the prepared tin and smooth the surface, then excavate a small dip in the middle to prevent a doming effect as the cake rises in the oven. Bake for about an hour, then cover with foil and bake for half an hour more, checking with a skewer every 10 minutes: it’s done when the skewer comes out a little sticky, but not claggy with mixture.Leave the cake to cool in the tin, then use a skewer to poke holes all over the top and pour over a little more whisky, tea or juice. Leave this to soak in, then tightly wrap the cake, still in its greaseproof paper, in foil and leave to mature. Feed it with more booze (or tea or juice) every week or so (or when you remember), until you’re ready to ice nearer the big day.Heat the jam with a splash of water until bubbling. Spread on top of the cake. Roll out the marzipan on a surface dusted with icing sugar, until large enough to cover the cake. Lift it over the cake, gently smooth down and trim the edges. Leave to dry for a couple of days, then brush with whisky (or cooled boiled water). Repeat the process with the ready-to-roll icing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258d5513bbc98a53fdfd255bd87aec471365ea94/0_106_4952_2971/master/4952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a082e4019b3f6b574fd0c9c94077f2f6","title":"ravinder bhogal recipe mussel rice sweetcorn soup","story":"A cross between a chowder and a Chinese broth, this will brighten up the darkest winter days in only 15 minutesMy mussel and sweetcorn soup is a cross between a chowder and a Chinese soup.

Klopp claimed Liverpool lost their “mojo” in the intense atmosphere of the Stadion Rajko Mitic, where a changed team featuring Joel Matip, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge – who was withdrawn at half-time – were easily subdued by Group C’s bottom-placed side. It was Liverpool’s third consecutive away defeat in the Champions League – the club’s worst run at the highest level of European competition since 1979.Asked to explain what went wrong in Belgrade, Klopp replied: “I only have 10 fingers.” He elaborated: “They were aggressive. They were aggressive in the last game as well only then we did better. We made life a bit too easy for Belgrade. That is the main problem. They deserved it with the passion they showed. They gave everything. For us it was not clicking, it was not easy. We never came back into situations. We had the moments, we played good balls in at the right moments, but then we had the ball in the box and could not really finish. I saw a few games like this already and it is really difficult to find your mojo back. You can only do the right thing in the right moment. You have to be very natural. You try to solve problems on the pitch and you don’t find solutions on the pitch, you solve problems. That’s a completely different situation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfdfabf159fdc62f69285a5810c4a378d3f5ee5e/0_74_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eab37a3f6b8d47d0cee11a2caca273e0","title":"sheffield derby united wednesday","story":"A Dutchman in freefall faces a seismic showdown with a local hero on the up when United host Wednesday on Friday nightThe age-old maxim goes that form counts for nothing when the stakes are so unbearably high, but there is no doubt that the 130th Steel City derby is a meeting between two teams ostensibly heading in different directions. In the red corner at Bramall Lane will be third-placed Sheffield United and in the blue, a disorderly and off-colour Sheffield Wednesday who will make the four-mile journey south after four successive defeats.When Wednesday arrive on Friday evening, they will be entering Chris Wilder territory. The United manager was a boyhood Blade ballboy, fan and then full-back before being offered his dream job in May 2016. Wilder’s first taste of the Sheffield derby was on the terraces in 1980 as a 12-year-old, but savours every one like it is his last.His workaholic captain and top scorer, Billy Sharp, is made of the same stuff, the striker in his third spell at his hometown club. When United overcame Hull City on home soil last month to soar to the Championship’s summit, Wilder pulled a hamstring amid the celebrations when he booted the match ball up into the sky at the final whistle. “I’ve still got that player mentality, a little bit of edginess about me,” he said. “I enjoy working for the club that I love.”For Blades supporters, Wilder – who has a tattoo of the club crest – is their working-class hero. He is, as they sing, one of their own. Before the last derby, which finished goalless, Wilder said: “I don’t know how I can put this in a way that won’t offend people, but I know that if I’m on the Titanic and there’s a Blade and an Owl and one space left on that life raft, I’m dragging that Blade into it.”He grew up in Stocksbridge, north of Sheffield, but was born an old-school manager he tells the story of how, a few weeks into the job, he pulled £100 out of his back pocket to pay for some beers for his squad to enjoy on the journey home from Millwall, despite a failure to curtail a winless start to the season. Team spirit is the foundation for any success through the spine of his side are not only talented iniduals but also big characters.Wilder’s first move as manager was to sign Mark Duffy and the wily winger who joined on a free transfer from Birmingham has since proven himself a priceless commodity. Duffy turned to scaffolding while playing for non-league Prescot Cables after being released by Liverpool as a schoolboy, but he has shone in Sheffield.If Duffy is their catalyst, Sharp is their trusty source of goals, while the defender Chris Basham, summer signing Oliver Norwood and Dean Henderson, the England Under-21 goalkeeper on loan from Manchester United, have all been influential this season.Wilder’s other eye-catching loanee, Ben Woodburn, has struggled to make the impact many had predicted the Liverpool forward has just one league start to his name. Wilder insists the 19-year-old is not a “special case”.There is plenty room for improvement, though, and Wilder may take heart that his team can call on a home advantage on Friday. They have stuttered on the road, most recently coming unstuck against Nottingham Forest where his team were too flat, reminiscent of performances at Bristol City and Derby County.At Wednesday, the immediate forecast looks bleak. A lot has happened since Jos Luhukay’s first match in charge, that 0-0 at Bramall Lane at the turn of the year: 15 wins, 16 defeats, plus a few wondergoals from Adam Reach.Luhukay’s left-field appointment left a swell of supporters uneasy and after tumbling to within four points of the relegation zone, faith in the Dutchman is in short supply. Wednesday have shipped 12 goals in their past four matches, moreover, and have the joint-worst defence in the ision. Two wins in 10 matches makes grim reading no matter who you are.Luhukay has been hamstrung by the balance sheets. The chairman, Dejphon Chansiri, has sanctioned just one permanent signing – Joey Pelupessy on a free transfer from Heracles – since Luhukay replaced Carlos Carvalhal. After a harrowing 4-0 defeat to Norwich on Saturday, Chansiri became embroiled in a heated confrontation with supporters outside Hillsborough.During that match some fans chanted the names of Sam Hutchinson and Keiren Westwood, two players mysteriously ostracised under Luhukay. They are not the only ones either, with David Jones and George Boyd also exiled.Suggestions that some players have clauses in their contracts that could trigger extensions or have financial implications have been strenuously denied. “Absolutely not,” Luhukay said.The midfielder Barry Bannan has suggested the derby might prove to be the perfect tonic for Wednesday. “It is probably a good game to go into considering the circumstances we are in,” he said. “If we win then everything gets forgotten about and the fans will be happy again.”Either way, there is growing sense that Friday’s result will define whether Luhukay will indeed be afforded the chance to celebrate his first anniversary.• Portsmouth, Shrewsbury and Oldham will be among the teams hoping to avoid an FA Cup first-round upset this weekend, when they face Maidenhead United, Salford City and Hampton \u0026amp Richmond Borough respectively. Elsewhere, Ebbsfleet United entertain Cheltenham Town, who are yet to win in nine attempts in League Two under Michael Duff.• Liam Kelly is only 5ft 4in but has made an almighty impact since being handed his Reading debut by Jaap Stam two years ago. Described by the manager as possessing “world-class” technique, the midfielder, who joined the club aged eight, hit a fine goal in the win against Bristol City. Victory against Ipswich Town on Saturday would be their third successive home win.• After picking up one point from a possible 12, is it time to panic at West Bromwich Albion? “It’s not so much concern, it is more disappointment really,” Darren Moore said after his team slipped to seventh following defeat at lowly Hull. The Baggies entertain the league leaders, Leeds, this weekend. “We know what happens if you take your eye off the ball,” said Moore."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70296d9f545f55728047abf585d40c584932511c/1366_170_1551_931/master/1551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eafc0050af934c1967d0219944fa2c98","title":"which match has featured the most ballon dor winners on one pitch","story":"Plus: Glenn Murray’s ridiculous record, a straight flush of goalscorers and Freddy Eastwood, Southend legend • Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“I have a memory from an old childhood annual that Manchester United are the only team to have fielded three Ballon d’Or winners on the same pitch, back when Charlton, Law and Best were playing,” notes Dan Wardle. “Is this right? And which match featured the most Ballon d’Or winners on the pitch at the same time?”Dara O’Reilly kicks off with an excellent answer. “While Dan Wardle’s annual was probably correct at the time of going to press, I’m sure I won’t be the only person to point out that, when Michael Owen joined Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Original Ronaldo at Real Madrid in 2004, that meant the club were able to, on numerous occasions over that season, field four players who had won football’s most prestigious inidual prize. This means, I think, that the home leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Juventus (played on 22 February 2005) where all four of Los Merengues’ prize winners played against a Juventus side fielding previous winner Pavel Nedved, has the most Ballon d’Or winners playing of any club game in history, with five. Future winner Fabio Cannavaro also played for Juventus in that game, so a bit of creative accounting could argue that six actually featured.”Madrid trumped United’s trio but also the Milan side of 1992-93 with Fabio Capello having the luxury of fielding three of the four previous winners in Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Jean-Pierre Papin. The Rossoneri also repeated the feat in 2008-09 with Andriy Shevchenko, Ronaldinho and Kaká. Also worth noting that Milan enjoyed a monopoly in 1988 and 1989 as Gullit, Van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Franco Baresi occupied the top three places in voting.A slightly diluted tangent, but if we’re talking strictly about the number of inidual Ballon d’Ors, this would be between Barcelona (Lionel Messi – five trophies) and Real Madrid (Cristiano Ronaldo – five, Kaká – one) between 2009 and 2013 – a total of 11 ‘winners’ on one pitch.“Glenn Murray has scored against 80 of the 92 league teams,” notes Andy Rumble. “Can this be bettered?”To the Knowledge’s knowledge, no, although Andy’s fact does have to be slightly amended. Murray did indeed score against 80 Football League sides (hat-tip to Opta) during his time with Carlisle, Stockport County, Rochdale, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Reading and Bournemouth, although 11 of those 80 teams are no longer in the Football League: Barnet, Boston United, Chester City, Chesterfield, Dagenham and Redbridge, Darlington, Hartlepool, Leyton Orient, Stockport County, Torquay United and Wrexham.Of the current roster of 92, Murray has scored against 67 of them and is yet to score a league goal against 25 teams: Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton, Leicester, Sheffield United, West Brom, Hull City, Portsmouth, Coventry, Doncaster, Fleetwood, Burton, Gillingham, Scunthorpe, Oxford, AFC Wimbledon, Bradford, Lincoln, Colchester, Newport County, Stevenage, Forest Green, Crawley, Cambridge and Morecambe.Frank Lampard holds the record for the player to have scored against the most Premier League sides, with a whopping 39. Jermain Defoe is the leading current player, with goals against 36 Premier League sides, and could reach 38 if he notches for Bournemouth against Huddersfield and Cardiff this season.After Jamie Mackie topped the billing in last week’s lead question with a 11-second debut goal for Plymouth, David Carr has gone one better after nominating Brendan O’Callaghan, who scored from a corner on his Stoke debut against Hull in 1977-78, the ball hitting the net 4.4 seconds after play had restarted following his substitution.“I thought you might have mentioned Alberto Paloschi, then 17-years-old, who scored on his Serie A debut in 2008 for Milan with his first touch, 17 seconds after coming onto the pitch.” Thanks to John Day for that one.A number of you also pointed out that Freddy Eastwood scored just 7.7 seconds into his debut for Southend United in 2004. “He got a hat-trick that day,” writes Martin Rogers. “Instant legend.” Eastwood also scored on his debut for Wolves, following a £1.5m switch from Southend, and first cap for Wales in a 1-0 win over Bulgaria in 2007, although both of these goals came on the 45-minute mark.“Last month, King’s Lynn Town (of the Southern League Premier Division Central) beat Leiston 5-1,” writes Andy King. “Their scorers wore shirt numbers 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, respectively. Have there been any other straight flushes of goalscorers?”“On 11 February 1992, Burnley beat Northampton Town 5-0 at Turf Moor, on the way to the 4th Division title,” answers Chris Rawson. “The five goal-scorers were numbered 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, being respectively Steve Harper, John Deary, John Francis, Mike Conroy \u0026amp Roger Eli.”“Can someone please tell me why the Atlético Madrid club crest contains what looks like a bear trying to get jiggy with a cherry tree?” wondered Steve Guy way back in 2007.Well Steve, you have obviously never been to Puerta del Sol square in Madrid, because you would have seen the 20-tonne statue known as El Oso y el Madroño, a life-size model of a bear doing nothing more than sniffing a Madroño tree.The story goes that the word Madroño sounds like Madrid, so the tree was adopted as a symbol of the city. Bears used to be common around Madrid, so the two items were thrown together and they now appear on the city’s taxis, buildings and man-hole covers. Atlético added the bear and tree to their badge at some point between 1903 and 1919, and the seven stars on the club crest represent the autonomous region of Madrid (or Big Bear constellation).“So far this season Nottingham Forest’s Lewis Grabban has managed to miss and score a penalty in the same game on two separate occasions already,” writes Dean Smith. “Is this a record already for this particular feat?”“My team Dundee FC appointed a new manager recently,” emails Dougie McCrae. “Our first three results were 0-4, 0-3 and now 0-5.

In a move widely seen as the first salvo in a transatlantic cold war that will destroy the imaginary “special relationship”, Wayne Rooney (retired) has been called up for England’s friendly against the USA.The decision to play Rooney can only – only! – be read as a fantastically pointed insult to the Americans, who may not have qualified for the last World Cup but against whom we are openly fielding a novelty player. You could not send a clearer message to the US, even if you made sure pitchside advertising hoardings throughout the match read ELECT SHIT GET BANGED. And in a very smart two-for-the-price-of-one, the FA also contrived to insult the Nations League, given England’s match with Croatia is the competitive fixture for which the England-USA friendly is notionally the warm-up.Having said all that, I am concerned to note that among the wider public and pundit class, there still seems to be some failure to grasp that this is what the gesture specifically meant. It is almost as if people have looked at the record of the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, and concluded he could only ever be clever by accident. Martin’s sole notable success – the exhausted, quarter-hearted process of default by which he hired England’s most successful and popular manager in decades is presumably viewed as a case in point.Either way, there is much disquiet on the airwaves and internet about the decision to recall England’s top goalscorer for one night only. This is hugely positive. Anger is our last great manufacturing industry and people ranting furiously for or against the Rooney cap on phone-ins and online is productive in the very purest sense of that term. The row over Rooney’s 120th cap is ideal for those who very much want to fit in a November row before December comes around with its annual sports personality of the year row but who feel they honestly have not got another poppy row left in them.My advice to the FA would be to own this anger and to stage an undercard game before the Rooney one, in which 11 of the former players angrily attacking the decision face 11 of the former players angrily defending it. I imagine it would be fairly evenly matched until injury time, when Ryan Giggs would put the winner past Peter Shilton.Even as things stand, the Rooney cap should be saluted for the bollocks it has enabled people to talk. According to the England manager, Gareth Southgate, calling up Rooney is something “circumstances have allowed us”, which is an amusingly passive formulation for a pick he supposedly made himself.But what is the deeper meaning of the thing which circumstances have allowed us? “Acknowledging the Three Lions legacy has been a major part of our journey with this current group of young players,” Southgate wibbled merrily on Monday, “and Wayne Rooney is a hugely significant part of that history.” (Incidentally, I do love it when grown-ups say the Three Lions instead of England, as though they are learning how to speak British slang off a Linguaphone CD. Good luck in your English oral, guys!) For their part, the FA made much of the fact this is a game benefiting Rooney’s charity for disadvantaged children, The Wayne Rooney Foundation.According to some reports, Rooney was expecting to start, having led the England side out wearing the captain’s armband. According to others, he was to come on as a substitute. Keen to smother any misapprehensions in dignified, respectful and non-panicked manner, the FA has reportedly since briefed he will be given five or 10 minutes at the end as a “gesture of goodwill”.Meanwhile, it seems the England players were not consulted over the specific part of their legacy journeyhistory lesson that would be Wazza Rooney coming on for one of them. And for my money, we have not heard nearly enough agonising as to whether Rooney should have been allowed to wear the No 10 shirt off the bench (he will not be, apparently).In conclusion, these are all complex matters and we can only hope England win in every sense. The match could not be higher stakes if it was an early season MLS game. As for the blatant insult to the USA side, the penny has yet to drop with the American public but when it does I think we can expect swift retribution. Economic sanctions? Diplomatic expulsions? Chlorinated chicken off the Brexit menu? It’s unclear at this stage but if were the Global Britain mascot, Liam Fox, I would be in absolute bits about this rapidly developing situation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a593e52e27858ae95067d60992df28d8dccb26cb/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df97a557caf289c3ae6556ee01a25a13","title":"fgm rates in east africa drop 20 years study shows","story":"Analysis in British Medical Journal suggests dramatic fall in number of girls undergoing the practice, yet experts advise caution over the figures The number of girls undergoing female genital mutilation has fallen dramatically in east Africa over the past two decades, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.The reported falls in the rates of FGM are far greater than previous studies have suggested, though some in the development community have advised caution over the figures.In February, the United Nations Population Fund warned the number of women predicted to be mutilated each year could rise to 4.6 million by 2030, an increase driven by population growth in communities that carry out the practice.The study aimed to assess if FGM awareness campaigns targeted at mothers had been successful. Unlike many other studies, older teenagers and adult women – who tend to have higher rates of FGM – were not included. The research developed estimates by pooling and comparing FGM data by proportion across countries and regions, using a meta-analysis technique.Nafissatou Diop, coordinator of UNFPA-Unicef joint programme, said it was possible that girls included in the study would still undergo FGM at a later point in their teenage years.“Some girls who have not undergone FGM may not have reached the customary age for cutting and may still be at risk,” said Diop. “The age at which the girls are undergoing FGM changes from ethnic group to ethnic group. In Kenya, for example, the Somali community practice FGM on girls aged three to seven. But in the Maasai community they practice FGM when the girl is a teenager, aged between 12 and 14.”Although global FGM rates are falling, she added, increasing numbers of girls will be living in countries where FGM remains prevalent by 2030.“Because of the demographic trends, the absolute number of girls and women undergoing FGM will continue to increase,” said Diop.The authors also warn that while rates of FGM are falling in many areas, this downwards trend could easily be reversed.“If we think, ‘OK, let’s celebrate,’ and we don’t continue with the same efforts, that may have reverse consequences,” said Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, the report author and professor of biostatistics at Northumbria University. Risk factors – such as poverty, poor quality education and support for FGM among some religious leaders – continued to persist, he said.The study was based on data collected through demographic health surveys, developed by ICF International, and multiple indicator cluster surveys, which are directed by Unicef. Data ranged from the years 1990 to 2017 for 29 countries across Africa, and two countries in western Asia: Iraq and Yemen.Kandala added that trends varied both within and between countries.The report drew on 90 sets of survey data, covering 208,195 girls. The report did not examine the reasons why FGM rates had fallen, but said it was likely to have been driven by policy changes, national and international investment. National laws banning FGM have been introduced in 22 out of 28 practising African countries, according to the campaign group 28 Too Many.In Somalia, where there is no national legislation expressly criminalising FGM, anti-FGM campaigner Ifrah Ahmed said the practice was still prevalent. “I remember being at a school in Mogadishu asking girls about FGM. All the girls said they were already cut. Just one said she hasn’t yet,” she said, adding the girls were aged between seven and 12 years old.The report concluded that if the goal of eliminating FGM was to be reached, further efforts were urgently needed, including working with religious and community leaders, youth and health workers.“This package of comprehensive intervention could include legislation, advocacy, education and multimedia communication,” the report said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf2f880b899e3da2ca54c9cfb85f3c795e46853/146_855_3427_2056/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a54adefbf64dc90fa7e94437440663","title":"reinventing yourself after becoming blind podcast small changes","story":"Activist Christophe Oulé had a glittering career in engineering in Burkina Faso when he lost his sight.

Now, celebrities from Beyoncé to Michelle Obama are helping to tear up the idea of what a woman should sound likeNo one wants to sit next to a loud woman. I know this because someone recently moved the placement card on a dinner table to get away from me. That label – “loud woman” – has never been a compliment, even though some of us may wear it as a badge of honour. Picture a loud woman and she is in Technicolor, with the sound turned up past 11, looking like she is stuck in the 80s: big hair, massive gob, voice like a foghorn, part witch, part harridan, part pub landlady. You definitely don’t want to sit next to her when she has a drink inside her.So, what are we supposed to do with the idea of loud women in our postfeminist age? Where have they all gone? Theresa May seems to maintain her fragile power by being the opposite of loud. Angela Merkel built a 30-year career on being as unnoticeable as possible. The response to Germaine Greer in recent years can be summed up as: “Shut up.” Is it no longer acceptable to be a woman and a noisy, loquacious pain in the arse? After all, the women we now think of as loud usually communicate through performance as larger-than-life versions of themselves: Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lady Gaga.In everyday life, there is still something uncomfortable for a woman about being called loud, because the implication is that a) you don’t care about the people around you (otherwise, why are you making them feel uncomfortable?) and b) you don’t care what other people think about you. To allow yourself to be loud as a woman is to be borderline psychopathic – to switch off your empathy and your emotional intelligence – to love the sound of your own voice, to take up too much space. That is the theory, at least. (“Who do you think you are? Beyoncé?”)The reality, of course, is that the expression: “He is a loud man,” does not exist. Certainly, I have never heard anyone say it. A man may occasionally speak loudly. Traditionally, though, loud is a thing that certain women are, rather than something they do. Loud is a word we attach exclusively to women, often alongside the word “lairy”. Loud is a code that says to women: “Please stop doing that.” This, in turn, has often been a signal for women to turn around and say – almost childishly, but quite understandably: “I’ll take up all the space I want, thanks.”What a loud woman looks like, though, has changed hugely in the past two decades. With Michelle Obama publishing her autobiography, Becoming, next week, it is clear that a new generation of women want to redefine the term. As the former first lady puts it: “I admit it: I am louder than the average human being and I have no fear of speaking my mind. These traits don’t come from the colour of my skin, but from an unwavering belief in my own intelligence.” If you ask women whom they would most like to be as a public speaker, many will say Obama. Her speaking style – controlled passion, warm authority, approachable charisma – is extremely attractive. She is the new kind of loud: the volume is calculated and in tune with the audience.Thanks to digital platforms and social media, there has been a huge shift in the past 20 years in how women communicate and build a platform. Many of the women in the Top 10 chart of most popular TED speakers cannot be defined as loud, although their reach is extraordinary and they have built lucrative careers off the back of it. (To enter this chart, you need a minimum of about 10m views for a speech, so it is a fairly accurate measure of impact.) Brene Brown, a research professor who specialises in social work Susan Cain, an author Susan David, a psychologist Elizabeth Gilbert, who wrote Eat, Pray, Love and Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist, have all featured on this list. They are all speakers who embody the opposite of the fire-and-brimstone public-speaking presence of someone such as Margaret Thatcher. Often their message is about how to have your quiet voice heard in a noisy world. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that many women we may think of as stereotypically loud are secretly quiet. Take Barbra Streisand, currently punting a new album at the age of 76. She had appalling stage fright for years and would only sing live at charity gigs. Adele? She is the richest UK celebrity aged 30 or under and an extraordinary performer. But she has been so nervous in the past that she has vomited into the front row as a result, she strictly controls her exposure to the stage. There are many recent examples of high-profile women who have decided to change things not by shouting the loudest or by drawing attention to themselves, but by starting initiatives that promote other women: take Reese Witherspoon’s multimedia brand, Hello Sunshine, Jameela Jamil’s “I Weigh” campaign (encouraging people to “weigh” their life achievements) and Sharon Horgan’s production company, Merman.At the recent People’s Vote march in London, at least half of the speakers were women, many of them under 30. They were all impressively accomplished orators, able to play to a crowd of thousands and to the camera at the same time (they were being filmed, so that the video could be relayed). Watching them and soaking up their confidence, it occurred to me that what was impressive was that none of them could be dismissed as loud women. Yet their impact, no matter what your politics, was striking.The difference in their styles, particularly among the younger women, was noticeable. A few held forth almost like spoken-word poets, in the style of Hollie McNish or Kate Tempest, allowing themselves to sound creative and passionate. One – an NHS doctor – spoke with quiet, dignified anger. Another was an old-school union speaker, addressing the crowd exactly as a leader of the NUS would have done in the 70s, complete with Citizen Smith intonation. Their styles were as varied as those of the male speakers. This variation and experimentation among female leaders is something we are only starting to see.Just as the past few years have seen a rise in the body-positive movement and an understanding of the expression “fat shaming” and the extent to which those ideas have been internalised, I wonder if the “loud shaming” of women is finally being recognised. Samuel Johnson’s horrible quote about women and public performance is more than a century old: “A woman’s preaching is like a dog’s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well but you are surprised to find it done at all.” When I was a child in the 70s, it was common for me to be told to be quiet and stop showing off – at home, at school, by adults of all kinds. It was not until I was much older that I realised I was not being loud or showing off – I was just talking. This is not necessarily a woman thing it is only in the past few decades that children have been allowed to be as noisy as they want. Anecdotally, many women will say that they learned from an early age that being loud – whatever this means – was not welcome behaviour.“Whatever this means” is important. Because I think we are redefining what it means to be loud. We are starting to understand that you are not obliged to be loud just because someone has told you not to be. My grandmother was a great role model for me when I was growing up. She could be loud. She ran a corner shop with a rod of iron, spoke her mind, laughed raucously and did not suffer fools gladly. But she also agreed with the old saying: “Empty vessels make the most sound.” Modern feminism has to hit a happy medium between these extremes. Don’t make noise for the sake of it, but don’t shut up either. There is a lot of experimentation to be done in the space between those options. As for the person avoiding me at dinner? Maybe I was just wearing too much perfume.How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking by Viv Groskop is out now (Bantam Press, £12.99).

Here are her biggest takeawaysIn 2014, I started Tinder Live! – a comedy show exploring the crazy world of Tinder. This means that in the last five years, I’ve spent many, many hours browsing the app (so much so in fact that I am relieved there’s no way to know how many hours I lost on there).Like many people, I’ve had multiple profile versions, and deleted and undeleted my profile countless times. It’s come to the point where I frequently see the same men and think, “You’ve come up like five times now buddy, what’s going on, are you OK?”Through all this swiping, I like to think I’ve learned a lot about men. To be fair, “men” in this case can mean men I’ve never met but see a lot on Tinder, men I did meet on Tinder and men I talked to on Tinder but never went out with. Here’s what I learned, using an admittedly broad brush because it’s what dating apps push you to do: sense a pattern and then become upset by how persistent the pattern is, leading you to believe (usually falsely) that everyone is the same.This blows my mind. So many men on Tinder will bemoan becoming pen pals, say they don’t want their time wasted and just want to meet already, but will also think that their saying “Hey” and asking you how your Sunday was, the end, should be enough conversation for you to invest $50 and two hours getting ready and traveling to a bar to see if they’re worth your night out.I guess the idea here is to have no connection at all, and presume this guy is the total package, and to spend a few hours in person seeing if you’re wrong because, eh, what’s a waste of a night of your life? I don’t get this, I’ll never get this, and I hate it.I’ve seen so many men try to find a cute, chill way to say in their bio that casual sex is fine I guess, but they’d prefer a connection lol no big deal or not haha whatever: here’s a quote from The Office. It’s such a bummer and so relatable. Because while men are busy trying to be coy about whether or not they want something more, so are women.But what if, WHAT IF, we were both honest and both got what we truly wanted?I don’t know if it’s in an effort to play it cool, but even men who “super like you” will not message you. They won’t message you first, leaping at the chance to because OMG you liked them back and they liked you so much! And they might not even message you back if you message them first.Nope, they super liked you, just to let you know they’d … what? Super bang you? I have no idea, but it really bums me out.I’m convinced the guys who match with you and never message you just love online dating because they like having a capsule full of women who would, in their minds, definitely sleep with them. Which is bizarre because when I swipe right, it’s because someone’s face – combined with my very vague idea of who they are – is enough to get me to the next level. I want to know how they speak, how they treat me, how their mind works, what jokes they tell, what they do, who they are, how they’d be to date. And then maybe, maybe I’ll meet them and see if I wanna meet them again.I don’t think I’ve ever swiped right on someone and thought, “1010 would fuck. I don’t even need to know if this guy has a brain, or if he hates gay people, or has a swastika tattoo. Nope, my vagina says yes!” But whatever you need to tell yourself, dudes.And then there are the yellers. These are the guys whose profiles just say, “I’m on here to get off this app. Please don’t waste my time. If you can’t carry a conversation, swipe LEFT!!!”I get it. Spend long periods of time on any dating app with the intention of finding even the most fleeting meaningful connection and you’re bound to get to a point where you’re tempted to make your profile, “OMG if you don’t want to meet someone on here swipe left, seriously, WTF I’m a good person!!!!!!!”The yelling and aggression aside, it’s comforting for me to know that some men are as fed up as women are with the games and the flakiness and the waste of time that dating apps can be.I’ve had friends tell me I should change my settings to include much older men, but I have to tell you I’ve had zero experience with older men being kinder or more engaging or self-aware or more forthcoming and giving on dating apps. In my experience, you’re just as likely to find a man who seems sweet and takes you on cute dates and is charming and fun and 23, as it is to find a guy who is boring and selfish and lazy and 38.The idea that all older men are wonderful gems and all young men are worthless erections is reductive and untrue. So calm down, everyone! Let’s just stop advising each other to choose a 50-year-old dude when we’re 25.As much as it could be easy to end this on a negative beat, I will not do it.If I thought dating apps were full of creeps and losers and nothing more, I wouldn’t be on them at all. Many guys whose profiles are absolutely ridiculous end up being surprisingly sweet. And that is how I know, or at least suspect, that sometimes the guys with the ridiculous profiles are just trying to be what they think women want them to be.They’re trying to be what we’re all trying to be online: fun and casual and with an appropriate and not too excessive amount of human feelings. And the good news is, sometimes they let themselves go beyond that and actually connect with the person in front of them.I have so many friends who met their now husbands and wives on Tinder. It happens, and in increasing numbers. And they’ll sometimes blush and regrettably tell their story: it’s stupid, yeah, we met on Tinder, I know, it’s weird. But that’s what keeps me swiping, and I think that’s what keeps the gems – the really incredible gems of men who I’m still really excited to meet – swiping too.Lane Moore is a comedian, writer, actor, musician and creator of the critically acclaimed comedy show Tinder Live.

Should they all remain and Liberty’s proposed meeting in Miami be also added in 2020, it would rise to 23. However, the teams have already been clear in their opposition to the calendar growing much further.

He’s the fourth Englishman to score a century on debut in Asia after Keaton Jennings, Alastair Cook and Bryan Valentine.Another plug for Rob’s Spin column, on how Ed Smith’s rotation of the England side is a small piece of visionary thinking.Smith and his team have interrogated normative thinking. Why can’t you have a specialist batsman at No7? Why can’t you have a wildcard bowler like Adil Rashid? Why can’t you leave out a bloke with 433 Test wickets?Ben Foakes talks about the moment he got his century: “I was calm with Leachy there, then I had five to go with Jimmy there and I got a little bit nervous. When I hit the ball that brought it up, I was pretty confident I’d got it - then I saw Herath running around and it didn’t look like he was going to get to get there. It was such a relief and a great feeling.“Getting a few runs settled me down and to get my first catch early was great. With Jimmy bowling, you know you’re in the game.”On the evidence of today, England’s spinners are more impressive than Sri Lanka’s. Moeen, Leach and Rashid all found turn, hit good lengths, and bowled excellent lines. The finger spinners did the hard graft, with Rashid coming on as more of a strike bowler. The leggie was absolutely excellent today and, I felt, could have bowled more. Sri Lanka’s gaggle, however, could not find that turn – is that due to the wicket changing, the roller, the new ball?Meanwhile, Ben Foakes looks born to play Test cricket. He batted wonderfully calmly and gives England something of a dilemma once Bairstow is fit, as he looks a superior keeper too if that stumping from Rashid is anything to go by. Does this mean revisiting the idea of Bairstow as a specialist batsman and pushing him up the order? It didn’t work in the summer, but you’ve got to find a place for him.Not content with liveblogging the first half of today’s play, Rob Smyth has also written our weekly Spin email. It’s a good read, which you can have here:12th over England 38-0 (Burns 11, Jennings 26) “Since the 4th over, the scores read ‘Burns 1, Burns 2, Burns 3, Burns 4, Burns 5, Burns 6’,” writes Tom Adam. “More singles than the OBO readership HONK.” And that’s the end of the day’s play after a watchful Jennings sees out a Herath over. That puts England into a very strong position, with a lead of 177 runs and all of their second innings wickets intact.11th over England 36-0 (Burns 11, Jennings 24) “Akila, Akila, Akila” is the cry from behind the stumps, and it’s not hard to see why - it’s a very appealing phrase to say out loud. Go on, try it. Talking of appealing, the spinner – who has replaced Dilruwan – does so after Jennings is caught propping forward (he’s been doing more of that) in front of the stumps but the ball is too high. Last over in the day coming up.10th over England 35-0 (Burns 11, Jennings 23) There’s something deeply comforting about watching a man with the physique of a country pub’s landlord trundling up to the wicket and turning his arm over, something a bit village green and easing yourself into a deckchair with a pint of bitter. It will be a shame to see Herath go, a cricketer from another time. Burns whips him uppishly through midwicket for four, before tucking away a single to fine leg. Jennings picks up a run from an outside edge.9th over England 29-0 (Burns 6, Jennings 22) Dilruwan drops short and Jennings is able to cut hard through backwards point for four. It prompts a defensive adjustment to the field as Sri Lanka attempt to block the flow of runs. The spinner is not really attacking the stumps from around the wicket, so goes over to Burns for one ball, before switching back again. Odd.8th over England 23-0 (Burns 5, Jennings 17) Herath comes on for a bowl in his final Test. Burns trots down the wicket, working him to leg for one. Jennings dab sweeps for another single. Both left-handed batsmen have taken guard on off stump in an attempt to limit Herath’s options.7th over England 21-0 (Burns 4, Jennings 16) Jennings is playing Dilruwan off the back foot too, which is what did for him in the first innings. He’s giving himself time to spot the turn, rather than necessarily picking it out of the hand. It seems to be working at the moment, but it doesn’t feel like it’s a long term strategy that will always serve him well.6th over England 20-0 (Burns 3, Jennings 16) Burns is quite twitchy at the crease and is batting carefully. He sees off a few dots, before running a sharp single to midwicket. Jennings has been happy to hang on the back foot, and steers Lakmal through the covers for a couple more.5th over England 17-0 (Burns 2, Jennings 14) Burns gets himself off strike with a clip to leg having struggled two overs previously against Dilruwan. Jennings, who has been timing the ball nicely, is watchful before a leg side poke brings him a couple.4th over England 14-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 12) Jennings punches Lakmal for two through the covers, before guiding him nicely through third man for a boundary. England lead by 153 runs in the match.3rd over England 8-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 6) Jennings sweeps Dilruwan for a single to fine leg as he continues to play his shots early on but Burns is more watchful and gives the bowler an appreciative nod as one turns sharply from the footmarks. A half-hearted LBW appeal is turned down with the ball going on with the arm down the legside. Nine overs remaining in the day2nd over England 7-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 5) Lakmal takes the ball at the other end. I wonder if that’s a missed trick as a spinner might have taken the openers out of their comfort zone. Jennings cuts him for four through backwards point, perhaps a bit edgily. He bottom edges the next delivery attempting something similar and is lucky the ball bounces down and well clear of the stumps. But, sticking with that cut, he does engineer a single to point.1st over England 2-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 0) Dilruwan opens the bowling with England likely to face a lot of spin for the rest of the day. Burns is batting and, at least outwardly, is showing no effects of that injury he sustained when being hit at short leg. He’s off the mark with a push to mid-on. A leg bye follows. I wonder if it eases the pressure opening the batting without Cook at the other end. Certainly a bit less intimidating to try to live up to him.Well, that was a very impressive few sessions for England with the spinners - and Moeen particularly – dominant. His four wickets have taken him past John Emburey on the list of most successful English spinners (he has 149 to Emburey’s 147 and is closing in on Fred Titmus’s 153). Rashid was under-used, I thought, and bowled beautifully while Leach was accurate and deserved his two scalps. Not much to say about the batting: Mathews was grittily impressive, Chandimal was hampered by injury but batted well. The rest? Not so much. Foakes was very solid and England’s fielding was impeccable.Lakmal goes for a slog and edges to Anderson at backwards point. England lead by 139 runs68th over: Sri Lanka 204-9 (Lakmal 14, Herath 12) Rashid’s googly foxes Herath again but just misses the outside edge. Herath sweeps for a single, before Lakmal does spot a googly and takes a single. And then an extraordinary shot from Herath - a reverse sweep that goes over the head of slip for another single. And then ... 67th over: Sri Lanka 200-9 (Lakmal 14, Herath 12) The batsmen exchange a couple of singles, before Lakmal carts Leach for four in what feels like a bit of a last-gasp run-grab from the final pair. They bring the 200 up, with the partnership wirth 25 from 23 deliveries.66th over: Sri Lanka 192-9 (Lakmal 8, Herath 10) Root turns to Rashid, who sends a loosener down the leg side, before a single brings Herath on strike. Rashid catches him dead in front of the stumps and he is given out on the field. But the review spares him as UltraEdge shows the ball flicked the glove on the way through. Rashid sends him a googly down the next ball, and it totally foxes Herath but he gets out of jail next ball with a swept four.65th over: Sri Lanka 187-9 (Lakmal 7, Herath 6) Leach whirls away at the left-handed Herath, who brings out the reverse sweep for a four through backward point. Unexpected. He picks up a single with a more conventional sweep. Burns is back on the field, incidentally, which probably solves the problem of who is going to open. That’s drinks.Mark Hooper writes: “It seems to be a bit of a worldwide trend (well, this match plus the Pakistan series and the Australia team anyway) for the non-specialist batsmen to be making the bulk of the runs - it’s becoming like the false 9  4-6-0 trend in football. Maybe we should just pick all-rounders throughout the squad and be done with it64th over: Sri Lanka 181-9 (Lakmal 6, Herath 1) Herath, in his last Test match, is given a guard of honour as he walks to the wicket. Lakmal whips Moeen for two, to bring Herath onto strike and he blocks uncertainly. He gets off the mark with a solid sweep to fine leg before, out of nowhere, Lakmal drives Moeen for four straight down the drive. Lovely shot.A ludicrous wicket. An innocuous ball is slapped squarely to Buttler at deep extra for no good reason at all. Sri Lanka in all sorts of trouble.A good question from Richard O’Hagan: “If England bowl Sri Lanka out before close of play, will Burns be allowed to bat? If not, who would you push up the order to do the job? (This is clearly an unforeseen consequence of preferring Rashid to Denly)”. Moeen has opened in the past, or Root?Not that strong an LBW shout: there is an inside edge.62nd over: Sri Lanka 173-8 (Lakmal 0, Dilruwan 20) A lovely over from Moeen. He turned one past Akila’s outside edge, the batsman prodding uncertainly, so tried it again and got his edge. Lakmal survives two balls, before a strong LBW shout is turned down. Root reviews …A tremendous ball from Moeen, that takes a feather of an edge and is caught wonderfully well by Foakes (who continues to have quite the debut)61st over: Sri Lanka 173-7 (Akila 0, Dilruwan 20) Now we’re into the lower order, I wonder if that brings Rashid into the reckoning. Leach continues, and draws an edge from Dilruwan which runs just wide of Stokes at slip.Moeen hangs the ball outside off stump and Dickwella cannot resist the drive, but scoops the ball to Buttler who takes an excellent ing catch.60th over: Sri Lanka 171-6 (Dickwella 28, Dilruwan 18) These two are quietly ticking along quite nicely, though Dilruwan mistimes a cart through cow corner and is fortunate the ball drops short of the two deep fielder. Neither of these two batsmen are going to be shy, though they’re not playing recklessly either but then ...59th over: Sri Lanka 168-6 (Dickwella 26, Dilruwan 17) Dickwella is using his feet to play Leach, trotting down the wicket and attempting to work him to leg with the spin. Or at least he was until he decides a reverse sweep is more the order of the day. It doesn’t come off, so he reverts to trotting down the wicket - this time he clips Leach elegantly through the air to the midwicket boundary for four. Sri Lanka trail by 174.58th over: Sri Lanka 164-6 (Dickwella 22, Dilruwan 17) There is much chatter around the bat, and a lot of oohs and aahs, as Moeen twirls away. Suspect the noise is as much to get into the batsman’s head as anything else, as Moeen is bowling well but not extraordinarily. One run from the over.“As a fellow Northants resident, can I point out to Richard (53rd over), who calls himself ‘a slightly bitter Northants fan’, that the statement is tautologous. If you are a Northants fan, you are by definition slightly bitter. It’s enough to say I’m a Northants fan. People will know the rest. I believe this also applies to Aston Villa fans.”57th over: Sri Lanka 163-6 (Dickwella 21, Dilruwan 17) I could captain this side: Leach replaces Stokes which seems sensible given these two batsmen are swinging their willows around. Leach is accurate but Dilruwan capitalises when he drops a touch short and whips two runs through midwicket.56th over: Sri Lanka 161-6 (Dickwella 21, Dilruwan 15) Moeen’s getting nice drift, suggesting he is giving it a good old tweak, but he is milked for a couple of singles. Root doesn’t have a cover, in an effort to get Dilruwan to drive, and the all rounder takes the shot on, carting Moeen for an aerial four. Surely it’s time for Rashid or Leach at the other end.55th over: Sri Lanka 154-6 (Dickwella 20, Dilruwan 9) Stokes is still bowling, but does find Dickwella’s edge as he fishes outside off. The ball dies well short of first slip, however, and a misfield earns him a run. Stokes has upped his pace, and hurries Dilruwan into a false shot leading to a few oohs and aahs. The all-rounder prods a single from the next ball to bring up his 1000th Test run, making him the fastest Sri Lankan to 1000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests. Dickwella’s not going to let him hog the limelight though as he ramps a short ball from Stokes over Foakes’s head for four. Crikey, that’s a risk at this stage of the Sri Lanka innings. Eight from the over is expensive.54th over: Sri Lanka 146-6 (Dickwella 14, Dilruwan 7) Moeen continues, with two slips in place for Dickwella. Well, in fact, it’s a slip and a ludicrously short gully - who I think is Joe Root. He’s fielding on his knees, perhaps five feet from the bat, in a bid to be very close to the ground in order to counteract any lack of carry. I think this is something Jack Leach has brought with him into the team, as I have a vague memory of Trescothick fielding that way to him at Somerset.53rd over: Sri Lanka 145-6 (Dickwella 13, Dilruwan 7) Dickwella follows a Stokes cutter but is quite a distance from edging it. The left hander prods into the off side for a single allowing Dilruwan to unfurl an elegant cover drive for two a few balls later. Not sure why Stokes is on.“In response to Dominic Cole (Over 46), doesn’t the stat about so many Surrey players being picked yet them winning so few caps show what anyone who follows county cricket already knows?” emails Richard, who calls himself “a slightly bitter Northants fan”. “That a player needs to do far less for Surrey in order to get picked for England than for any other county. Score a few half centuries or take a couple of five-fers down at The Oval and you get your England Cap quicker than you can say “Jade Dernbach? Surely the ‘truly baffling bit’ is not that they get so few caps, but that they get picked ahead of other better players around the Counties. Ah well, it was always the case.”52nd over: Sri Lanka 142-6 (Dickwella 12, Dilruwan 5) “Go on Mo,” is the call that goes round the field as Moeen trundles in. There’s a slip, leg slip and short leg in place as he bowls to Dilruwan, who remains comfortable in defence throughout a maiden over.51st over: Sri Lanka 142-6 (Dickwella 12, Dilruwan 5) I’d have been tempted to go with spin both ends, but Root sticks with Stokes who bowls short at Dilruwan after being clipped for a single by Dickwella. Stokes’s radar is a bit wonky, and he slides one down the leg side before finally getting it straighter, but Dilruwan can work him for one from the last ball of the over. Rashid is standing in the deep with his hands on his hips, probably wondering how it is that he’s not bowling given the prodigious turn he had been finding. 50th over: Sri Lanka 140-6 (Dickwella 11, Dilruwan 4) The ball got stuck in the pitch, with Mathews playing with bat and pad, but the ball caught his inside edge and popped up to Jennings for a sharp ing catch to his left. The right-handed Dilruwan Perera, a bowling all rounder, comes in and tries to go over the top second ball and only just about gets away with it. Could be a spicy few overs here with two attacking batsmen in on a turning wicket.Joe Denly is on for Burns, with Keaton Jennings wedged into short leg as Moeen continues the over that was interrupted by that injury before tea. And he catches Mathews first ball after the restart!The word is that Burns is OK and is getting some ice in the changing rooms but may not field after tea.Here’s a big call from Adam Giles: “With the overwhelming successes of recent introductions to the team, such as Mssrs. Curran and Foakes, is it just me or is this England team starting to feel like one that could keep going for a fair amount of time, much like the Australia team of the 90s and early noughties, when the likes of Gilchrist, Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Warne and McGrath grew into quite the formidable force. Perhaps too early to set such lofty ambitions, but when the likes of Broad and Anderson are entering the twilight of their careers, as well as the recently departed Chef, perhaps a formal changing of the guard is impending.”Feels a bit early to compare the side to that Australia side if I’m honest, and the top order still looks like a shambles. But from five down, England seems to have plenty of potential and options.The umpires take the players off for tea while Burns continues to be treated on the pitch. He’s sitting up now, with the physios manipulating his head and neck. Hard to tell from here, but the fact he’s sitting up and looks alert and conscious feels like a good sign. Think the physios are just going through their checks thoroughly rather than being too alarmed. Ah, and he stands up and walks from the field unaided, which is an even better sign.There is a pause in play after Dickwella sweeps Moeen hard, and the ball cannons off Rory Burns at short leg. That hit him hard, on the full, on the back of his necktop of his back. He goes down and the England physios are on very quickly. That’s nasty but he’s conscious and talking but there is plenty of concern on the pitch.49th over: Sri Lanka 135-5 (Dickwella 10, Mathews 52) Stokes come on, which is a good call I think. But the field is set up for length bowling, rather than some short stuff, which is less of a good call I think. Dickwella glides him to third man for a single, before Mathews pulls him for four because Stokes does drop short and there’s no man at deep square. Not great cricket, that. The field is tweaked, and though Stokes gets tighter, he allows Mathews to drive him punchily through the covers to reach his 50 - his 30th in Test cricket.48th over: Sri Lanka 126-5 (Dickwella 9, Mathews 44) Moeen begins to find a little turn, whipping one into Mathews’ pads from out of a foothole. Could be a sign of what’s to come on days three and four. A maiden.Throwing this one out to the hive mind:47th over: Sri Lanka 126-5 (Dickwella 9, Mathews 44) Anderson ploughs on and a clam Mathews guides him to third man for a single as he continues to make something of a point to a board that was keen on dropping him.46th over: Sri Lanka 125-5 (Dickwella 9, Mathews 43) Moeen comes on and comes around the wicket in an attempt to turn the ball away from the left-handed Dickwella. He drifts one across the batsman, hitting on the full on the pads, but the ball was heading down the leg side. Another delivery is almost at yorker length as he attempts to force Dickwella to drive. As so often with a Moeen over, it is tight right up until the point he is slog swept for four.“In the last two years seven Surrey players have made an England debut (Ansari, Stoneman, CurranT, SCurran, Pope, Foakes and Burns),”emails Dominic Cole. “There are also another four Test players on the books in Clarke, Plunkett, Batty and Borthwick. But here’s the truly baffling bit - they’ve won 40 odd caps between them and seven of them have two caps or less.That simply has to be a record. It wouldn’t be much of a surprise either if Roy and Virdi (with the A squad this winter) also soon made an appearance. That leaves Dernbach as the odd one out and he once made the Test squad and was 12th man. Don’t think evenYorkshire can match that.”45th over: Sri Lanka 121-5 (Dickwella 5, Mathews 43) Anderson does continue and Dickwella sticks with his attacking instincts, keeping things ticking over at a run a ball so far. Stokes is still virtually hand in hand with Foakes behind the stumps, so concerned is he that the ball won’t carry. There’s not been much suggestion of a nick so far.44th over: Sri Lanka 118-5 (Dickwella 2, Mathews 43) That was a lovely delivery from Rashid, drawing Chandimal down the track then some dip and decent turn sent the ball past the edge of his bat, into Foakes’s gloves, allowing the keeper to stump him very cleanly. It brings the left-handed keeper into bat which could have Root thinking about changing Anderson at the other end. Dickwella is off the mark with a swept single before Mathews clobbers a single to deep cover to add to his earlier run and the new man milks another."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d44dcff05d7c5f25012bbb177ae6363936e20f7/1277_905_3160_1896/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c842466af98083487194299b24d8c01c","title":"misty copeland interview ballet broken disney nutcracker prince obama","story":"She thinks ballet’s broken – and has a plan to fix it. The star of Disney’s Nutcracker reboot talks about racism, nude shoes and growing up bendy‘Ballet was definitely my escape,” says Misty Copeland. “It was the first thing I’d ever experienced in my life that was mine – only mine, not my five other siblings’. It gave me a voice, made me feel powerful.”When Copeland discovered ballet she was 13, living with her mother and siblings in a motel in California. She was a shy, slight child who rarely spoke and tried not to be noticed. Twenty-three years later, hers is the kind of transformation story even ballet might think far-fetched. In 2015, she became the first black female principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre – and with that a spokesperson, poster girl, and bona fide star. Barack Obama sought her out as an adviser, Prince invited her on tour, Spike Lee wants her in his films, and people queue up to meet her at the stage door of the politan Opera House in New York.And now the latest chapter in her real-life fairytale has begun to unfold. Copeland is dancing in Disney’s The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, a cinema revamp of the Christmas favourite starring Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman.Like all ballet dancers, Copeland is petite and perfectly put together, beaming with unerring positivity and a ready giggle as she sits in this London hotel room with a camel mac draped over her knees to keep warm.This is a woman who’s had a tough life but seems to have come out of it with no hard edges. In ballet, where many things on stage look much as they did a century ago, there are few women of colour in major companies, and Copeland remembers the moment when she knew she had to take on the mantle of role model. She was watching a documentary about the Ballets Russes that featured pioneering black ballerina Raven Wilkinson. “I had this awakening,” she says. “I didn’t even know she existed. I saw her and it was this unexpected reaction. I was crying. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I have this bigger purpose that I never even realised.’”Copeland has actively sought out opportunities to bring ballet to new audiences and to change its image, from speaking engagements to endorsements and book deals. When millions of viewers see her in an Under Armour commercial, she says, “they will see a brown ballerina and think, ‘Oh, that’s what a ballerina looks like.’ When you can imagine yourself on the stage, especially as a young person, it allows you to dream of doing anything.”When she was a child, Copeland had no dreams of ballet. The family moved a lot as her mother married and orced several times, there was little money and Copeland kept her head down. But, in fact, she was always a ballerina – she just didn’t know it. She loved grossing out her brothers with what her hyper flexible joints could do, but she had no idea she might have the perfect physique for a particular type of dance. She hated her skinny, long legs, big hands and “pinhead”.Luckily, one of her teachers noticed. Copeland took her first ballet class on a basketball court at the local Boys and Girls Club, but it wasn’t until she stepped inside a studio, donned tights and leotard and looked at herself in the mirror that this homeless teen realised she had finally found home.Copeland was 13, a very late age to start dancing for a professional, but she progressed fast with teacher Cindy Bradley. When her mother could no longer take her across town to classes, Copeland moved in with Bradley (which led to a difficult, highly publicised custody battle, a low point in Copeland’s life). At 18, she joined American Ballet Theatre’s studio company, then its corps de ballet. But a serious stress fracture, followed by sudden weight gain after the delayed onset of puberty, led to her confidence crashing.Copeland credits her survival to a series of mentors, mainly successful black women outside dance, and to ABT’s director, Kevin McKenzie. “He was sensitive enough to see that I was a young girl on my own, had never really had a stable home. He did what he could to help me grow when other people within the artistic staff didn’t want to see me get those opportunities.” Because you hadn’t paid your dues? “No, because of my skin colour. Because of my body. I know those things for a fact.”As well as the overt racism, there were subtle signals that this wasn’t her world.Until recently, pointe shoes only came in a “nude” colour that was pale pink. “What does it mean that we’re wearing pink tights?” she asks. “It’s because that’s the colour you’re expected to be.” Ballet shoe maker Freed has just launched the UK’s first pointe shoes for darker skin tones (Gaynor Minden does a similar range in the US), although Copeland still colours hers with pancake makeup. “It’s the little things that make you feel like you don’t belong.”Things are changing, slowly. When Copeland arrived at ABT, which is based in New York, she was the only black woman there. Now there are three. Audiences are changing too. “Especially in the States – that’s something I’ve seen open up so much in the past five years. To see, outside the Met, a line stretching from the door to the street of brown young people.”But it’s not just about who’s on stage, it’s what they’re doing up there. “We’re getting them in the door,” says Copeland. “But now we have to keep them there. So I think we’re going to have to evolve again with the stories we’re telling, so people can connect with them.”How much responsibility does an art form have to reflect the world and send positive messages about race or gender? “I think it’s extremely important,” says Copeland. “Especially with ballet, if we don’t open ourselves up and evolve with the times, we’re not going to be relevant and people aren’t going to be interested in coming. I understand becoming a character, and that not every time you step on stage has to be some amazing political statement, but I also think we have so much room in classical dance to grow.”In the film, Copeland plays a ballerina in the land of toys come to life, dancing a ballet that tells the story of the Four Realms – as the Sugar Plum Fairy (Keira Knightley) and our heroine Clara (Mackenzie Foy) look on. The Nutcracker and the Four Realms has taken the well-worn favourite, with its notoriously weak plot, and given it some Hollywood drama-doctoring. It’s something film does all the time – could ballet not do the same? “Right!” says Copeland. “Absolutely!” The film, she says, gives more depth to a story “that can seem very light and cheesy”.It also has a feminist slant. In the original tale, Herr Drosselmeyer is the maker of magical toys, but in the film Clara’s mother is a more talented inventor. What’s more, Clara, something of a bystander in many Nutcracker ballets, is here heir to the Four Realms her mother created, and “a new kind of princess”.If a company like Disney, synonymous with the pretty princess myth, can drag itself into the 21st century on matters of gender and race, can’t ballet follow suit? “It’s scary for us to make change,” says Copeland. “It’s like, ‘Don’t fix what isn’t broken.’ But in my opinion, it is broken. The times are changing and we have to catch up. I think the more we bring in newer people with fresh ideas behind the scenes – artistic directors, choreographers – those things will change.”There are plenty of people in ballet who are doing exactly this (Tamara Rojo at English National Ballet comes to mind, having commissioned Akram Khan to reimagine Giselle). But elsewhere, tradition reigns supreme and a 19th-century worldview permeates many classic ballets. Copeland mentions the exotic eastern fantasies La Bayadère and pirate tale Le Corsaire. “You think of Corsaire as this light thing, but it’s not really. It’s slaves, these women chained up. I think we could have stories that really reflect different cultures in a fresh way, you know? Ballet is worldly, so let’s represent what we all are.”To this end, Copeland has set up a production company that has lots of ideas in the works. She has also been swapping ideas with Spike Lee, who keeps pushing her to act in his films. “I’m like, ‘No, I want you to help me create something.’”Nonetheless, she’s enjoying her on-camera moment in The Nutcracker, a role that cements what feels like a sudden rise to stardom but has actually been long in the making. Despite her innate talents, Copeland has always been playing catch-up for her late start. She wasn’t promoted to principal dancer until the age of 33 (“very late”). But in the last few years, everything has come together. She has even married her long-term boyfriend, lawyer Olu Evans.“I was such a late bloomer,” she says, “in terms of my emotional growth and the environments I grew up in. I feel like I progressed as a woman so late – but then when I did, it was all at once.” And now, it seems, there’s no stopping her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3d18224580fa0df8f40eab30e94c8f12da34de/0_104_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e24192507642b076c4ed5e6f8c9a390","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook committee hearing pressure","story":"Australia, Argentina and Ireland join UK and Canada in urging Facebook CEO to give evidence to parliamentsParliamentary committees from five countries have called for Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to appear in front of a joint hearing on online disinformation.Committee chairs from Australia, Argentina and Ireland joined the call on Wednesday, following last week’s joint request from the UK and Canadian governments. Between them, the five countries have an estimated 170 million Facebook users.“We call on you … to take up your responsibility to Facebook users, and to speak in person to their elected representatives,” the five chairs write in a jointly-signed letter.With or without Zuckerberg, the joint committee will meet in London on 27 November, led by Damian Collins MP, the chair of Britain’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. The committee’s inquiry into fake news and disinformation has regularly called for Zuckerberg to appear, but been rebuffed each time.On 2 November, following the joint request from the UK and Canada, Facebook again declined on Zuckerberg’s behalf, telling the two committee chairs, Collins and Canada’s Bob Zimmer, that it was “not possible for Mr Zuckerberg to be available to all parliaments”.In the six months since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Zuckerberg has appeared just three times in front of legislatures: twice in the US Congress, and once in the European parliament.“Mark Zuckerberg has set himself the personal challenge of ‘fixing’ Facebook this year to prevent its misuse in our democratic process.

Pelosi said Americans have all “had enough of ision”.“Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America,” she said.Earlier in the evening, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, sought to downplay Democratic gains, saying: “Maybe you get a ripple, but I certainly don’t think that there’s a blue wave.”But Democrats racked up upsets across the country.Incumbent Randy Hultgren lost a traditionally Republican suburban district to Lauren Underwood, a 31-year-old African American nurse who ran a campaign focused on healthcare. Military veteran Max Rose pulled off an unexpected win in a conservative district on Staten Island in New York, and the deep red state of Oklahoma elected Democrat Kendra Horn to a district centered around Oklahoma City.Elsewhere, Democrats Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland made history by becoming the first Native American women elected to Congress. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York became the first woman in her 20s to win a seat and was joined by 29-year-old Abby Finkenauer in Iowa.It was a record year for women, with at least 90 winning their elections on Tuesday. The majority of them were Democrats, and at least 28 of them were elected to the House for the first time. Voters also sent Congress its first two Muslim women – Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota.However, Republicans extended their control of the Senate, paving the way for a ided Congress.In one of the most closely watched races, the Republican Texas senator Ted Cruz fended off an unexpectedly tough challenge from Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat who inspired young voters and raised an unprecedented amount of money. O’Rourke mounted the most promising attempt by a Democrat to win a statewide office in Texas in decades, but in the end fell just short of Cruz, who was elected in 2012 on a tea party wave and ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016.The elections carry significant ramifications for what remains of Trump’s first term.With a majority in the House, Democrats are expected to launch a flurry of investigations into the president and his administration. The White House’s legal team is reportedly bracing for potential inquiries that include whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia investigation, the misuse of taxpayer dollars by several cabinet officials, and hush money paid to women to keep silent about their alleged affairs with Trump before he was elected president.The Democratic victory would also stonewall much of Trump’s agenda. Republicans had vowed to pursue further tax cuts and changes to popular government programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and social security. They also pledged to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s healthcare law, a years-long quest that will assuredly fail with Democrats now holding one of the chambers.The increased Republican majority in the Senate, however, will make it easier for Trump to continue to appoint judges and remake the nation’s judiciary branch in a more conservative mold.Four Democratic incumbents lost in the Senate. Three-term incumbent Bill Nelson of Florida lost a tight race to the state’s governor Rick Scott, while two-term Democrat Claire McCaskill lost her re-election bid in Missouri.Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota – two Democrats who won in deep red states with Obama at the top of the ticket in 2012 – also lost their re-election bids. All four voted against the controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court.In Tennessee, the Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn emerged victorious in a contest that drew national attention after pop star Taylor Swift endorsed the Democratic candidate, Phil Bredesen.Democrats had been defending 10 Senate seats in states that Trump largely won by double digits two years ago, rendering the battle to win back the upper chamber of Congress an uphill struggle that was ultimately lost.Higher than usual turnout was reported across the country, where 36 governor’s contests reinforced the ramifications of what former president Barack Obama dubbed as perhaps “the most important election of our lifetimes”.Democrats took several Republican-held governor’s offices, including pulling off a major upset when Tony Evers defeated Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, denying the polarizing Republican and one-time presidential candidate a third term. In Kansas, voters rejected Republican Kris Kobach, a hardline immigration activist who cozied up to Trump, in favor of Democrat Laura Kelly.But the loss of Andrew Gillum in Florida marked a major disappointment for progressives. His Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, was a close Trump ally who drew criticism for running what many saw as a racially isive campaign against the state’s first black major-party candidate for governor.Gillum, the mayor of Florida’s state capital Tallahassee and a rising star in the Democratic Party, vowed in his concession speech to remain “on the front lines”.“We still have to be willing to show up every single day and demand our seat at the table,” an emotional Gillum told supporters.The fate of Georgia’s governor’s race remained unclear in the early hours of Wednesday, as Democrat Stacey Abrams, who was trailing Republican Brian Kemp by less than three percentage points, said she would not concede.“I promise you tonight, we are going to make sure every single vote is counted,” said Abrams, who is vying to be the nation’s first black woman governor. Georgia’s voters experienced some of the biggest disruptions and longest waits of the election.“Democracy only works when we work for it, when we fight for it, when we demand it.”Democrats have sought to cast the 2018 midterms as a referendum on Trump, whose tenure in the White House has left Americans sharply polarized and has been defined by chaos, tribalism and the shattering of norms.While crisscrossing the country on behalf of Republican candidates, Trump’s closing argument ahead of the election largely consisted of stoking fears around a caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and headed toward the US-Mexico border. The president also repeatedly declared that Democrats, if elected, would lead a “socialist takeover” of America.Although a number of Democratic heavyweights hit the trail to stump on behalf of candidates, including Obama, the narrative was still dominated by Trump and his freewheeling rhetoric.As he said at a rally on Indiana on Monday: “The midterm elections used to be, like, boring.“Who ever heard of midterms? Now it’s, like, the hottest thing.”Additional reporting: Lauren Gambino in Washington"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a8fea9593eaac4781f2be3c9ec2486b6bc4e5fe/95_0_2704_1624/master/2704.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5da34b02ba84f6ca4a1aa258a2323b63","title":"midterms 2018 first history making election wins","story":"Diverse candidates are hoping to break barriers across the country. Here are the key wins so farGroundbreaking campaigns have broken barriers this election, with historic candidates changing the face of Congress and statehouses across the US.

We will continue updating throughout the night as more results come in.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise victory in the June congressional primary in New York shook up Washington and the Democratic party. The progressive challenger and member of the Democratic socialist party unseated a powerful 10-term New York congressman, running with a campaign ad that said: “Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office.”Now age 29, she has become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik previously held the record when she was elected to Congress at age 30 in 2014.Pressley was the first black woman to serve on Boston’s city council and made history again after defeating the 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano in the primary. She did not face a challenger in the general election, making her the first black member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts.In her victory speech in September, she said: “These times demanded more from our leaders and from our party. These times demanded an approach to governing that was bold, uncompromising and unafraid. It’s not just good enough to see the Democrats back in power but it matters who those Democrats are.”Tlaib ran unopposed in her race to represent Michigan’s 17th district and has become the nation’s first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, and one of two Muslim women elected on Tuesday.She is a Democratic-Socialist who served on the state legislature from 2009 to 2014 and ran her congressional primary campaign supporting Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing Ice. Tlaib was famously escorted from a Trump rally in 2016 as she shouted questions at the candidate, asking him if he had ever read the constitution.Ilhan Omar, also the first Somali-American in Congress, is a formerrefugee who spent the last four years as a state legislator. There, she pushed a progressive agenda, including a $15 minimum wage and subsidizing higher education costs for low-income students.As the Democratic nominee for governor in Colorado, Polis ran on a leftwing platform, which included single-payer healthcare, repeal of the death penalty, universal full-day preschool and stronger gun laws. Polis, who declared victory late Tuesday night, has long been outspoken in favor of marijuana legalization.Kate Brown, who is bisexual, became the first openly LGBT person elected governor in 2016 when she won her Oregon race. Jim McGreevey, a Democrat and former New Jersey governor, came out while in office in 2004.An attorney and former MMA fighter, Davids became the first Native American congresswoman and the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas.Raised by a single mother army veteran and a member of the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk Nation, Davids was a fellow in the Obama White House.In New Mexico, Deb Haaland became the first Native American woman to chair a state political party. Now, the former Democratic chair has also become the first Native American congresswoman in the US, alongside Davids. A citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, Haaland is a longtime activist who ran on a progressive platform, including Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and the impeachment of Trump.A Republican who represents Tennessee’s 7th congressional district, Blackburn has become the first female senator in the state. Her race received national attention after the pop star Taylor Swift, who previously avoided politics, endorsed Blackburn’s opponent, the Democratic former governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn has been closely aligned with Trump and is farther to the right than the GOP senator she is replacing.Maine has elected its first female governor, the Democrat Janet Mills, who was the state’s attorney general. She declared victory early Wednesday morning and is replacing a controversial and bombastic Republican governor, Paul LePage. She regularly clashed with LePage, who is known for his overtly racist comments and was once caught threatening a state lawmaker in an an obscenity-laced voicemail.In Iowa, Abby Finkenauer beat the Republican Rod Blum, who has held the seat since 2014. In addition to being the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa, at age 29, she is also one of the youngest people ever elected to the House. She is a two-term Democratic state representative.The 2016 National Teacher of the Year and first-time political candidate Jahana Hayes won her bid to represent Connecticut’s fifth congressional district. Hayes is the first black woman to represent the state in the Congress, and, alongside Massachusetts’ Pressley, will be one of the first two women of color to represent New England.More than a third of the population of the Lone Star state may be Latino, but until Tuesday, no Latina had been elected to represent the state in congress. Veronica Escobar, a former county judge, won her race in Beto O’Rourke’s former district in El Paso, while Sylvia Garcia trounced her Republican opponent in Houston.“It’s about time,” Garcia told supporters, according to the Texas Tribune. “But you know, it’s never been about being a first.

His father was a travelling salesman, his mother a housewife, and he had a sister, Ruth, who was seven years older. He says his parents sheltered him from the deteriorating conditions for Jews in the 1930s, but recalls seeing brownshirts – SA paramilitaries – parading in the streets and once caught sight of Adolf Hitler passing on a train.On Kristallnacht, a cold November night, his family were marched down to the town square with other Jews while their burning synagogues lit up the sky around them. Koschland’s father was taken away to the concentration camp of Dachau, near Munich. He was released a few weeks later, and applied for places on the Kindertransport for his son and daughter, promising that he and his wife would join them as soon as possible. “A child takes a promise like that not just at face value, but at full value,” says Koschland.His place on the Kindertransport was obtained with the help of Jewish organisation B’nai B’rith, and, aged eight, he left Fürth in March 1939, travelling to Hamburg and then taking a ship to Southampton – a picture of the ship, the SS Manhattan which brought 80 refugee children to the UK, adorns the wall of his living room. The only English he knew was one sentence his parents had taught him: “I’m hungry may I have a piece of bread?” His sister was allowed to travel soon afterwards, boarding with a family in south London, but did not see her brother again until later in the war.Koschland went to a hostel in Margate, in Kent, before being evacuated in 1940 to a village near Lichfield in the Midlands, where he boarded with an elderly Jewish family. He exchanged letters with his parents until war broke out in September 1939. One of his great regrets is that, at the suggestion of a school friend who told him that having letters in German in wartime would incriminate him, he destroyed them. “I’ve regretted it every day since,” he says.Koschland lost contact with his parents at that point and spent the war not knowing what had happened to them. He was told of their fate after the war had ended in 1945 by his sister, who met him from school and told him that a survivor of the camps had provided information that they had been deported and were dead, murdered either in Riga in Latvia or Izbica in Poland in 1942. I ask him how he coped with the news. “I took it in my stride,” he says. “There was nothing I could do, and life had to go on. It was only as I grew older that it started to hit me hard, when I heard other people saying: ‘We are going to see Mum and Dad.’ That was something I couldn’t do.”Nonetheless, he says he never had the survivor guilt that plagued so many others who escaped the Holocaust. “I’ve never had that feeling of being guilty. I’m thankful that my parents sent me away to carry on living. I can’t undo the past. I can think of the past, but I have to look at today and tomorrow. That’s the lesson I give to the youngsters I talk to.”Many years later, he was invited to visit Fürth by the town authorities, staying in a hotel overlooking the town square – now renamed Freedom Square – where, on Kristallnacht, his family had gathered as their community burned. “I had the perhaps childish feeling that I can now walk across it, even though you made me stand there, years ago,” he recalls. And walk across it he did, pleased to have outlived the regime that killed his parents.• Remembering the Kindertransport: 80 Years On is at the Jewish Museum, 129-131 Albert Street, London NW1 from 8 November to 10 February www.jewishmuseum.org.ukTomorrow: Ruth Barnett: ‘Years later, my mother appeared, a total stranger’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b77bf84818c456c48cec15b04b4f91e653ed06d/0_98_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e8d1cfe6cc5ea9fdecf989a28afcdc","title":"twist in alleged 1bn art as russian tycoon detained in monaco","story":"Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of AS Monaco, has been under investigation by prosecutors in the principalityPolice in Monaco have detained Russian tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev for questioning as part of an investigation into corruption and influence peddling, according to reports.Rybolovlev, who owns the football club AS Monaco, was held on Tuesday and police also searched his luxury residence in Monaco, Le Monde newspaper said.A judge in the principality has been investigating whether Rybolovlev sought to influence law enforcement officials in his long-running dispute with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier.The Russian alleges Bouvier swindled him out of $1bn by overcharging him on 38 pieces of art he purchased over a 10-year period and is suing his former art adviser in Monaco, Singapore and Switzerland. Bouvier has denied wrongdoing.The Monaco prosecutor confirmed an operation linked to the investigation but declined to say if Rybolovlev was being questioned by police.Asked about the Le Monde report, Rybolovlev’s lawyers in Russia declined to comment on whether he was being questioned and said: “We request that the presumption of innocence in relation to Mr Rybolovlev is strictly respected.”All those involved have denied wrongdoing.The Russian businessman, who earned his multi-billion-dollar fortune through the sale of two Russian fertiliser producers, bought Donald Trump’s Palm Beach mansion in 2008 for about $100m.The questioning of an inidual under investigation is a standard procedure. Being under investigation in Monaco is not equivalent to being charged. It is the first step in an investigation.The feud between Rybolovlev and Bouvier led to the resignation in September of the head of Monaco’s judicial services after Le Monde daily wrote about connections between Rybolovlev and Monegasque justice officials.Rybolovlev spent more than $2bn buying 38 masterpieces from Bouvier between 2003 and 2014.In 2017, Rybolovlev sold Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Christ, Salvator Mundi, for $450m at a Christie’s auction, making it the most expensive painting ever sold.Ryboloblev has also sued Sotheby’s for $380m, alleging the auction house helped Bouvier defraud him.

Her son was in prison. She was trying to look after his two young children, who were aged one and two. Their mother was emotionally unstable. Bugget-Kellum did not want the chaos of the adults’ lives passed down to another generation.“We didn’t know if they would be safe with their mother,” she recalled recently. “I began to pray, please God, I need some help. There were so many things going on.”While at the clinic, Bugget-Kellum learned about a new parenting programme designed for carers of young children who have faced early adversity such as domestic abuse, homelessness or the loss of a parent to incarceration. “It was like I had my ammunition and I knew how to fight,” said Bugget-Kellum of the programme.The scheme, called Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-up (ABC), pairs parents with a coach trained in the needs of infants and toddlers who have experienced trauma.Bugget-Kellum’s coach reinforced simple techniques to form a healthy bond between adult and child, and helped her work through her own emotional wounds to create a less stressful environment at home. The results were so transformative, she said, that she started working as a parent coach for the same programme.“I have a son who is 26 and in prison, so I’m thinking maybe had I had an opportunity to get some of this, I don’t know, maybe I could have been more nurturing,” she said. “ABC gave me the confidence to say, you can do this. I don’t have to be angry with myself any more.”Traumatic or highly stressful childhood experiences are known to have lifelong emotional, behavioural and physiological impacts. Children who are abused, neglected, or exposed to conflict, violence and horror, are far more likely to have drink and drug problems, criminal records and perhaps resort to violence and abuse themselves. But researchers have also found that interventions such as the ABC programme can significantly buffer the damaging effects of stress and trauma, even at a biological level.A growing number of advocacy and public health organisations are working to bring “trauma-informed” approaches into the mainstream for doctors, carers and first responders.Scientists are continuing to untangle the complex biological effects of childhood trauma on the brain and body. Research in the past decade points to “toxic stress” as the root of the connection between adverse childhood experiences (Aces) and health problems in adult life.The theory is that continuous or repetitive exposure to stressful situations through, say, domestic abuse, or growing up in poverty, causes the body’s natural fight-or-flight stress response to stay switched on. Researchers say that without the influence of a caring and calming adult the stress becomes “toxic”, and elevated cortisol levels change the functioning of the child’s brain, weakening the immune system and even altering the way a child’s DNA is “read and transcribed”.“This is the source that a lot of the problems in our society can be traced to,” said Leena Singh, programme director for the National Paediatric Practice Community on Adverse Childhood Experiences (NPCC), which has an office in San Francisco. “There is a saying in public health – we need to move upstream. This is the work that is the root of the root.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theSingh’s organisation is working to integrate screening for adverse childhood experiences into standard paediatric primary care. The programme hopes to recruit 1,000 clinicians to screen 300,000 children for Aces over three years and is running pilot sites at six clinics across the US, with plans to add more.Singh says paediatricians have a vital role to play. They could refer patients for behavioural therapy or social support, but in medical schools they are rarely trained in the impacts of toxic stress. There are logistical hurdles to overcome too, such as how to add another process on to providers that are already overburdened, and how to bill insurers for time spent screening.NPCC says it is working through its pilot sites and member network to resolve those problems. It is also involved, through its parent organisation, the Center for Youth Wellness, with a clinical study on the effects of Ace interventions on certain biomarkers.Ultimately, Singh believes, their work could contribute to long-term shifts in the paediatric field. “If we can address and intervene early when some of these things happen in very young children we can actually prevent some of the risky behaviours and health impacts later in life.”One of the main challenges in pushing the model further, say proponents of trauma-informed care, is the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the approach. Researchers, including the CYW group and Mary Dozier, creator of the ABC intervention, say they are working to fill that gap. Many programmes take a two-generation approach to try to short-circuit the cycle of physical, emotional or substance abuse. Tennessee, for instance, is in the third year of its Building Strong Brains initiative, a $1.25m scheme to fund innovative Aces-focused programmes across the state.One programme funded under the initiative, called Thrive by 5, will conduct Aces screening on all pregnant women at the Baptist Memorial Hospital for Women in Shelbyville. Women who report four or more of the different types of childhood adversities (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence, household substance abuse or mental illness, parental separation, orce or incarceration) will receive programme interventions and parenting education.Another programme called Handle With Care, which started in West Virginia and since expanded, allows police officers to notify a child’s school if they are called to their home for potentially traumatic event like domestic abuse or a shooting. School officials don’t receive any incident details but the notice allows them to better respond to behavior changes or offer necessary support to the student.The “infant courts” are also expanding. Zero to Three, an advocacy group for early child development resources, started piloting “safe babies court teams” in 2005, and now has more than 20 sites across the US. The teams work with young children separated by the court from their parents, often because of abuse or neglect, providing developmental medical screening, mental health services and community advocates to ease the trauma of entering the foster care system.Parents can receive psychological services too to deal with traumas of their own – a study by such a team found that more than two-thirds of parents in the programme had an Ace score of four or higher.Tucked inside a bipartisan opioid epidemic bill just signed by Donald Trump, called the Support for Patients and Communities Act, are several federal provisions encouraging wider recognition of Aces and trauma-informed care. The bill calls for an “interagency task force” to identify best practices within three years for mitigating the impact of trauma on infants and children and to create a national strategy to improve coordination of trauma-informed care at a federal level. The bill also authorises the Department of Education to provide grants to schools for mental health programmes to help mitigate the impacts of childhood trauma.Experts say greater cross-sector collaboration and more funding is needed for trauma-informed care to really make a difference. “The lifelong manifestations of that childhood trauma are cross-sector – it effects educational outcomes, employment opportunities, it affects your health,” said Marc’s Lieberman. “You’re not going to make a population-level impact without a cross-sector approach.”That makes the execution of trauma-informed care inherently complicated. But at bottom there is a simple and revolutionary idea, says Lieberman: “It’s about moving from ‘what’s wrong with you?’ to ‘what happened to you?’”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

As both teams up the stakes ahead of next year’s European elections, France is seeing a rerun of its 2017 presidential run-off, in which French president Emmanuel Macron faced far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen. The outcome, this time, may be very different.But 2018 has been long and fraught for Macron, whose ratings are in free fall. His liberal policies have yet to bring the promised economic renewal and the Benalla scandal has tainted his presidency. Le Pen renamed her far-right party earlier this year. Historically called Front National, it is now National Rally (RN), in a bid to erase memories of her father’s leadership and rebrand as the nationalist alternative to Macron’s globalism. The goal was to go “from opposition and into government” – but until now, the opposition was timid, when it was heard at all. With only eight MPs in the Assemblée Nationale against 308 in Macron’s party La République En Marche (LREM), the nationalist party couldn’t even form its own parliamentary group (the minimum is 15 MPs) and has limited influence in a Macron-controlled parliament. That could change.At first world war commemorations, Macron has condemned “the absurdity of warlike nationalism” while admitting it’s having a comeback in a Europe “more fragmented than ever”, thanks to “parties playing up fears everywhere”. This moment, he has said, resembles the interwar years.With his European partner Angela Merkel’s announcement that she is leaving office soon, Macron finds himself the face of Europe’s liberals, with one of the EU’s biggest storms approaching. Fighting nationalism doesn’t just mean defeating Le Pen anymore. When Viktor Orbán, while visiting Matteo Salvini in Italy in August, called Macron “the leader of the pro-migrants”, Macron threw himself into the arm-wrestling match, replying: “If they see me as their main opponent, they are right.”But while the likes of Orbán, Salvini and Le Pen have already teamed up to offer well-rehearsed anti-immigration speeches, Macron’s alliances are not yet secured and his discourse is somewhat confusing. In an attempt to win over some of the populist voters, he has recently criticised the “ultra-liberal Europe” and wished for “a Europe that better protects workers and isn’t open to all winds” – words that would sound more normal coming from Le Pen.“The choice in the 2019 European election will be between Macron’s EU, working towards federalism and mass immigration, and a Europe of free nations, of identities and protections, the one we represent,” Marine Le Pen has said.Macron positioned himself as Europe’s next leader from the moment of his presidential victory, when he walked solemnly on to the stage to the sound of the European Ode to Joy. Now Macron must hope that he can live up to the claim.• Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain.

Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Head of IMO says there are 500 vacant consultant posts in IrelandProf Noel Fitzpatrick wraps confused bird in tweed jacket and returns it to Grand CanalADAPT Centre at Trinity College Dublin hosting public \u0026lsquothink-in\u0026rsquo for Science WeekGovernment-appointed expert group proposes financial penalty for underspendingMerchant\u0026rsquos Arch Bar one of last remaining guildhall buildings in DublinPosts approved last year have seen just 21 of 240 positions in mental health services filledBill could bring Ireland into E3 visa scheme, and benefit undocumented IrishIrish citizens could avail of documents not used by Australians under proposalGarda\u0026iacute to appeal to parents not to buy bikes at Christmas as they are a danger to publicPaul Wells snr, jailed for life for murder of Kenneth O\u0026rsquoBrien, may have been \u0026lsquoenforcer\u0026rsquoSeparately, D\u0026uacuten Laoghaire Rathdown County Council approves budget worth \u0026euro183mAbortion Bill: TDs debate 180 proposed amendments by pro-choice and anti-abortion TDsDublin man who pleaded guilty to filing incorrect tax returns described as \u0026lsquovery honest\u0026rsquo in referenceTaoiseach says delay should be no more than a \u0026lsquocouple of weeks\u0026rsquo, not monthsFormer president says British-Irish relations \u0026lsquomuch more fraught\u0026rsquo than in recent pastTwo others die in crashes in Co Laois and Co RoscommonGarda\u0026iacute believe Polish national found near Christ Church Cathedral was sleeping roughMinister says contractors responsible for sub-standard schools could face prison"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689442.1541593005!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin disciplines party figure over fianna f%C3%A1il candidate launch in north","story":"Mr Martin has sacked Mark Daly, a Kerry senator, as the party’s deputy leader in the Seanad.

Photograph: YinYangiStockThe Government is close to a landmark visa deal with the US which could allow thousands of Irish people to live and work there.In a significant development, a Bill has been introduced to Congress by Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal and Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner.A vote could take place on the House floor as early as next week when Congress reconvenes after the midterm elections, though the Bill must ultimately gain Senate support also, where it needs unanimous consent.Under the proposed legislation Irish citizens would become eligible for the E3 visa – a visa currently open only to Australian citizens.About 10,500 E3 visas are available to Australian citizens each year, but only about half of the visas are taken up. Under new legislation being drafted by the US department of homeland security, Irish citizens would be eligible to apply for any visas not used in the allocation. This could equate to about 4,000-5,000 visas per year.The Government’s special envoy to the US, John Deasy, said the Bill had bipartisan support and was being viewed as a non-contentious measure.“The introduction of the Bill in Congress is the first step in this process. If successful, our attention will then focus on the US Senate,” he said. He added that he expected the Bill would be dealt with under a procedure known as “suspension of the rules” which allows the House to process non-contentious measures swiftly.Mr Deasy, who has travelled to Washington in recent weeks, has been holding discussions with the office of House speaker Paul Ryan on a deal. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Washington has also been centrally involved.A key element of the agreement is that Ireland would ease the requirements for Americans who want to retire to Ireland, including granting US citizens the right to work for up to 20 hours a week.In addition, the minimum annual income levels currently required to retire to Ireland would be lowered."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688807.1541542506!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposed us visa deal welcomed by campaigners","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJohn Deasy, the Government’s special envoy to the US,  is confident that the proposal has bipartisan supportNews of a possible visa deal allowing Irish citizens to live and work in the United States will be welcomed by immigration campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic. Ireland has long argued that the number of visas allocated to Irish citizens does not reflect the strong historic links between Ireland and the US. More than 35 million Americans claim Irish heritage.Under a Bill that has been brought to the House of Representatives, Ireland would be allocated the portion of E3 visas not taken up by Australian citizens. Australia is currently the only country with the coveted E3 scheme, and is allocated 10,500 each year. The E3 is a two-year renewable visa which allows Australian citizens and their spouses to live and work in the United States. Australia negotiated the visa programme in 2005 as part of the US-Australia trade agreement. Applicants must have a job in the United States to quality and have certain academic or other qualifying credentials. But the E3 is significantly easier and less costly to obtain that the tradition H1B visa. The Government’s special envoy to the US, John Deasy, is confident that the proposal has bipartisan support, though it still needs to be endorsed by both the House and the Senate. This is not the first time Ireland has sought inclusion in the E3 scheme a similar proposal was put forward in 2015 but ultimately failed to get adequate congressional support. One key difference this time, according to officials, is the involvement of House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ireland is also offering a reciprocal arrangement to America which will see the Department of Justice ease the requirements for Americans who want to retire in Ireland. It is thought that the best chance Ireland has of securing a deal is in the coming weeks during the so-called “lame-duck” session of Congress when the outgoing members of the House and Senate continue to sit before the new members take their seats in January. One outstanding question is the status of the undocumented Irish already living in the US. While in the first instance the E3 visa scheme is likely to apply to future flows of Irish people, sources have indicated that discussions are also under way about accommodating undocumented Irish citizens who may qualify. Whatever the shape of the new Congress, the next few weeks appears to offer the best chance for Ireland to secure a breakthrough and make real progress on immigration reform.The news from Washington comes as the Irish Government on Tuesday approved a series of measures to deepen and enhance Irish-US relations, specifically inviting more American politicians to visit Ireland.While the Taoiseach and Ministers have made 169 visits to the US since 2012, visits by American politicians are rarer, and the Government will seek to invite more US mayors, members of Congress and national politicians to Ireland in the coming years.Approving a review of US-Ireland relations brought to Cabinet by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, the Government decided that there should be “aggressive engagement” with Irish-American politicians in the new Congress.The review also calls for more Irish diplomatic staff on the ground in the US, as well as the opening of a new consulate in Los Angeles.Share your stories and opinions with other readers, and receive the best Abroad content every week by email"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689448.1541592494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there s a passion that we need change democrats abroad in dublin","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            At the election watch party at the Arlington Hotel in Dublin on Tuesday nightWednesday morning.

Many of the teenage students were feeling first-hand, and perhaps for the first time in their lives, the social and psychological implications of a political election.“Everyone was shell-shocked,” Hildula said. “I was so excited to cast a ballot this year after the disappointment of the 2016 election. I pre-registered when I was 16 online because I knew I couldn’t just be apathetic about it.”Hildula was one of more than 150 absentee voters gathered at the Democrats Abroad election watch party at the Arlington Hotel in Dublin Tuesday evening, preparing to stay up all night with her friend Jack Merriman (19), a native Dubliner and fellow Trinity student recently elected to the Labour Party’s International Affairs Council.Merriman, who describes himself as an “international elections nerd,” has family in Chicago, and said he often stays up all night to watch poll predictions from elections outside of Ireland.“It’s going to be a long night for me,” he joked. “One of the hopes I had coming here instead of locking myself in with Irish friends was seeing people with a greater stake in it than I have . . . If everything goes right and that blue wave comes in, I want to see that vindication and happiness.”His dedication to staying up stems from two years ago, when he went to bed fully expecting Hillary Clinton to be elected the United States first female president before being awoken by his sister at about 5.30am with news of Trump’s impending triumph.Merriman credits what he sees as a rise in rabble-rousing politics in Ireland over the past two years to the 2016 US presidential election, which he believes emboldened people with bigoted viewpoints and policies at the national level. “US elections definitely have an impact on the political culture around the world,” he said. “I’m utterly terrified tonight won’t go well.”The election impact loomed large for Florida retirees Larry and Ellen Misita, who watched with fading optimism as it became clear Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson would lose gubernatorial and senate positions to Ron DeSantis and former Florida governor Rick Scott.While the couple on holiday in Ireland both expressed concern regarding climate change and Florida’s red tide emergency, they were cheered by the event, which they thought captured the spirit and renewed activism of the Democratic Party worldwide. “This is wonderful,” Larry Misita said. “Clearly there’s a passion out here that we need change. We need some sense of normalcy in our country. Trump and the republicans are tearing it apart.”Democrats Abroad reported on Tuesday that the number of Americans voting abroad was up almost 800 per cent from 2014’s midterm election. Carija Ihus (43), Vice Chair for Democrats Abroad Ireland, helped plan Tuesday’s event, and was one of many volunteers throughout Europe contributing to the more than 150,000 phone calls and 23,000 text messages sent to abroad Democrats this election season. Ihus has lived in Dublin since 2010 and was present for 2016’s watch party at the Arlington Hotel, where 400 democrats gathered with cautious optimism, which eventually gave way to horror in an election morning nightmare. “It was painful, to say the least,” she said. “Sometimes elections don’t go as you planned. This time around, Democrats are optimistic but it all depends on who shops at the polls, who is casting an absentee ballot and that the votes that are out there aren’t suppressed.”Ihus grew up in Atlanta and has cast a vote in Georgia for most of her life.While Democrat Stacey Abrams’s narrow defeat to Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia’s gubernatorial race was certainly a disheartening result, Ihus was adamant Tuesday’s party would not be a repeat of two years ago, where dry eyes were few and disheartened groans echoed throughout the room. “Our hope going into the night is we’d love to see all of them get elected, but if that doesn’t happen, we’d like to see positive races that are ground breaking,” she said.“We’re going to find something to celebrate.” The results on Wednesday morning indicate that the Democrats have won control of the House of Representatives, however the party’s hoped-for “blue wave” failed to materialise as Republicans looked likely to increase their majority in the Senate."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688764.1541542750!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk cabinet could agree to backstop review deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGeoffrey Cox, the UK’s attorney general, arriving at 10 Downing Street for a cabinet meeting. He described the EU’s willingness to consider a review mechanism for the backstop  a “major step” towards a deal. Photograph: BloombergTheresa May’s cabinet could meet later this week to sign off on a proposal for a review mechanism to determine how Britain could exit a backstop after Brexit. Mrs May told ministers on Tuesday that she wanted a withdrawal deal with the EU as soon as possible but not at any price.EU negotiators believe there must be movement on the backstop by the end of this week if there is to be a special summit to approve the withdrawal deal before the end of this month.During a cabinet meeting that lasted almost three hours, every minister contributed to a discussion of the Brexit negotiations which focused on the backstop. Attorney general Geoffrey Cox described the EU’s willingness to consider a review mechanism for the backstop as a “major step” towards a deal.Mr Cox is understood to have told ministers that a mechanism based on mutual consent could offer Britain the same certainty as a unilateral mechanism favoured by Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who spoke to Mrs May about a review mechanism on Monday, has ruled out a unilateral option.The prime minister’s official spokesman cautioned against speculation that a breakthrough was imminent, adding that Mrs May had stressed that nothing would be agreed until everything, including the future framework, was agreed.“She said that while 95 per cent of the withdrawal agreement had been concluded, on the Northern Ireland backstop there are a number of issues that we still need to work through, and these are the most difficult. This includes ensuring that, if the backstop is ever needed, it is not permanent, and there’s a mechanism to ensure that the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely.“The prime minister said she was confident of reaching a deal. She said that, while the UK should aim to secure a withdrawal agreement as soon as possible, this would not be done at any cost. “The prime minister said that, once agreement was reached on a withdrawal agreement, it remains the case that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and it will be subject to securing an acceptable full future framework.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, who supports a second referendum on Brexit, said the backstop deal was likely to leave the entire UK subject to EU rules indefinitely.“We are leaving the EU, but we are going to place ourselves in a relationship with the EU where we lose all influence over decision-making, and are likely to be subservient to the EU in critical areas about the nature of our future trading relationship with them, or for that matter the nature of the relationship that Northern Ireland has with them,” he told the BBC.“It really reinforces for me why we should have a people’s vote. What is going to end up being offered to the British public – and the government is going to seek to carry through parliament – is something markedly different from what was being discussed in 2016.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph:  Carlos BarriaReutersUS president Donald Trump has spoken of a “tremendous success” after the Republican party retained control of the Senate in the US midterm elections. Democrats have won control of the House of Representatives in the US midterm elections although the party’s hoped-for “blue wave” failed to materialiseAs election results continue to come in around the country, Democrats were forecast to secure a net gain of at least 35 seats in the 435-seat chamber prompting Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi to pledge her party would use the majority to restore the constitution’s checks and balances on the Trump administration. The European Union’s deputy chief executive hailed Democratic victories in comments that took a clear swipe at what he called “rudeness” and “racism” under President Donald Trump.“Inspired by voters in the US who chose hope over fear, civility over rudeness, inclusion over racism, equality over discrimination,” tweeted Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who is first vice president of the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker.“They stood up for their values. And so will we,” he added.Campaigning is getting under way in Europe for May elections to the European Parliament, in which Mr Timmermans is leading the campaign for the centre-left.A fellow Socialist commissioner, former French finance minister Pierre Moscovici who oversees economic affairs, also tweeted an ironic comment about mr Trump .“The Democrats win the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years despite powerful Republican gerrymandering,” Mr Moscovici wrote. “Donald Trump is right: ‘Tremendous success tonight’.”There was no immediate official comment from Mr Juncker or the Commission as an institution.Mr Trump’s criticisms of the EU, including praise for Britain’s decision to leave the bloc, his policies in the Middle East and threats of a trade war against the Union, worry EU leaders.Commission President Juncker secured a deal with Mr Trump in July to stave off new US tariffs on EU goods, but relations remain tense.

Photograph: New York TimesTuesday’s US congressional elections ended with what might be called a split decision. Democrats gained more than enough seats to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost ground to Republicans in the US Senate and came up short in some key governor’s races.Seven takeaways from the evening:1) The urban-rural ide is as pervasive as ever. Democrats, as expected, won in suburban congressional districts in places such as Virginia and Pennsylvania. But they were hammered in Senate races in rural states, losing seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. The party still is struggling to connect with blue-collar, white voters.2) President Donald Trump remains an inescapable political force. Democrats credit Trump’s unpopularity among women, minorities, young people and suburban voters with college degrees for their House wins. Republicans said his late-stage campaign efforts helped them pick up seats in the Senate. The president showed he remains popular in presidential swing states including Florida and Ohio. 3) Progressive stars had a tough night. Beto O’Rourke lost in Texas, Andrew Gillum in Florida and Richard Cordray in Ohio. None of them broke through, despite the enthusiasm they generated nationally. That means progressive candidates may have a tough time gaining traction in the scrum for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.4) Republicans held off a blue wave in governors’ races. Trump-backed Ron DeSantis won in Florida, Mike DeWine took Ohio, Kim Reynolds won in Iowa. All three states are key presidential battlegrounds.5) The Republican Party is more Trumpian than ever. Gone are Republican Trump critics in the Senate such as Bob Corker and Jeff Flake who are retiring. Also gone are Republican moderates in the House like Virginia’s Barbara Comstock and Colorado’s Mike Coffman who tried to keep some distance from the president but lost their races on Tuesday. Most of the remaining Republican congressional caucus is on board.6) Wedge issues raised late in the campaign helped Republicans. The party was struggling to find ways to engage its base until Senate Democrats rose up against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. All three of the Democratic senators who voted for Trump’s first high court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and then turned around and voted against Kavanaugh lost their seats. Trump’s continuing focus on the migrant caravan in Mexico turned out to be an issue that helped power some surprise wins in the Senate, but may have contributed to defeats in the House.7) Democrats had big success in the Great Lakes. The party held onto Senate seats in states in the industrial Midwest that Trump won in 2016. Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey and Michigan’s Debbie Stabenow never faced a serious challenge from their Trump-backed opponents – a positive sign for the party heading into the 2020 presidential campaign. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689253.1541569646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us elections democrats win house republicans hold senate","story":"In a close Texas Senate race, Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke has failed to unseat incumbent Republican Ted Cruz. However his strong performance has given hope to Democrats, who have taken control of the House of Representatives.

Photograph: REUTERSAndrew KellyDemocrats have won control of the House of Representatives in the US midterm elections, but the party’s hoped-for “blue wave” failed to materialise as Republicans looked likely to increase their majority in the Senate.As election results continue to come in around the country, Democrats were forecast to secure a net gain of at least 35 seats in the 435-seat chamber.Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi hailed the House victory, pledging to use the majority to restore the constitution’s checks and balances on the Trump administration. But speaking to activists at Democratic Headquarters in Washington she also promised a new spirit of bipartisanship “because we’ve all had enough of ision”.In a significant blow to the party, however, Democrats failed to flip any of the toss-up seats that could have opened a path to victory in the Senate. With many districts still reporting late on Tuesday, Republicans may in fact add to their current Senate majority of 51-49 when the final results are known.Tweeting from the White House where he was watching the election coverage with friends and family, President Trump tweeted: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!”In an excruciatingly close contest in Florida, Republican candidates narrowly won the gubernatorial race and were expected to win the senate seat. Andrew Gillum narrowly missed his bid to become the state’s first African-American governor, while current governor Rick Scott was ahead of Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, with 99 per cent of the votes counted.Similarly in Texas, despite pulling ahead in early polls, Democrat Beto O’Rourke failed to unseat incumbent Republican Ted Cruz, although his strong performance gave hope to Democrats who have long hoped that changing demographics in America’s second-largest state could turn Texas blue.As predicted, Democrats performed strongly in House contests, picking up dozens of Republican seats around the country. Early results show that suburban America voted Democrat overwhelmingly, even in traditional Republican areas, suggesting a frustration with the politics represented by Donald Trump.Women candidates also outperformed. In Pennsylvania alone - a state with no female candidates currently in Congress - four Democratic women won House seats: Chrissy Houlahan, Mary Gay Scanlon, Susan Wilde and Madeleine Dean.However, the Senate race was less positive for Democrats.As expected, Democratic incumbents in states won by Donald Trump came under pressure. Democratic senator Joe Donnelly lost his seat to Mike Braun in Indiana. President Trump campaigned with Mr Braun on the eve of the election. However, Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the Democratic exception - succeeding in securing a second term despite running in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump in 2016.Other toss-up races did not fall Democrats’ way. Despite hopes that Phil Bredesen could win the seat being vacated by Tennessee’s outgoing Republican senator Bob Corker - a frequent critic of Donald Trump - ultimately the seat was won by Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn.Democrats were also on track to win several governor races, including the governor’s seat in Republican-leaning Kansas and Michigan. However, the governors’ mansions in Ohio and Florida stayed in Republican hands in a setback for Democrats.Election night also contained some significant firsts. Jared Polis has become America’s first openly gay governor after winning the Colorado gubernatorial race. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress after winning the 14th congressional district of New York as predicted.In Kansas, Sharice Davids, an openly gay political newcomer, beat four-term incumbent Kevin Yoder in the third congressional district. She will become the first native American woman to serve in Congress.Speaking at Democratic Headquarters in Washington DC shortly after 11.30 pm on Tuesday, Ms Pelosi hailed Democrats’ decisive victory in the House, and she praised volunteers who “refused to stand still”.“Tomorrow will be a new day in America,” she said, congratulating the “dynamic erse candidates who have taken back the House for the American people.”Will there be a backlash against Trump?

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

I\u0027ve never been so happy,” he said.The former soldier, who now runs a gym, found Barrie alongside four dead puppies after hearing whimpering under a slab of concrete. She was nestled in rubble from a school that had exploded and collapsed.Sean Laidlaw, 30, meeting Barrie in Paris where he collected her from charity War PawsMr Laidlaw quickly named her Barrie - before he realised she was a bitch - and the two struck up a close bond.“I feel like it may come across that I saved Barrie\u0027s life, but I feel like she saved mine,” he said.He added: “Working in a war zone, coming back to camp you sit in your room on your own. To have a companion you can play with and train, it kept my mind away from all the things I was seeing and doing out there.You can only imagine how bad Syria is, and to be able to come back to the camp and train her for three hours, take her for a walk, things like that really took my mind away from where I was.It gave me a bit of normality, she definitely kept me sane.She stayed with me all day, every day. She did jobs with me, I\u0027d wake up, she\u0027d come eat with me, she\u0027d then sit in the passenger seat of my car when we drove to Raqqa.Barrie even had a harness made from a bullet-proof vest. I think as soon as Barrie and I bonded, where I could pick her up, for me she\u0027d already become my dog. Having a companion, is one of the best things to help with PTSD. A dog always makes you happy, always wants to be with you.”Barrie hiding in the rubble in Raqqa in February after being found by Sean LaidlawHowever, dog and owner were separated in April when, on a short trip back to the UK, Mr Laidlaw’s contact was cancelled. “I started thinking about how I could bring her back.My biggest issue was that I never had that moment with her to say goodbye as when I left I thought I\u0027d see her in a couple weeks.But then months passed and she\u0027s gone from a puppy to a full-grown dog. That was hard for me, as I worried she was a totally different dog.The former soldier, who served two tours in Afghanistan during his 10 years with the Royal Engineers, had already raised £4,500 to bring Barrie home, and had contacted War Paws -  a charity based which specialises in bringing dogs home from conflict zones - to help with with the veterinary tests and paperwork.Barrie was brought to Iraq in April where she was vaccinated and checked by the charity before being flown to Jordan in August, where she was quarantined for two months and underwent further health checks to come to the UK.Former soldier Sean Laidlaw reunited with his dog Barrie at home in Hornchurch in EssexA plan to fly Barrie to the Uk in October collapsed as Barrie was missing some paperwork, but Mr Laidlaw was able to collect his dog from Paris on Saturday after she was flown from Jordan by War Paws.“One of my biggest fears was that she wouldn\u0027t recognise who I was, or that she would be a different dog to the girl I left,” said Mr Laidlaw.He added: “It was pure joy when she realised who I was. She\u0027s exactly as she was back in Syria, it was just great to have my dog again.Everyone\u0027s got their lives, my parents and girlfriend are at work, and so when I get back I at least know I\u0027ve got my dog, and she\u0027ll always be there”.Please review our commenting policyUS midterm election results live: Democrats win House but Republicans hold Senate - latest newsHouse of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpA night of firsts: Meet the winners who have made history in the 2018 midterms US midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpMidterm elections: Everything you need to know about what happened overnight and what happens nextWhat is impeachment and how long does the process take?Theresa May faces mounting pressure from all sides to publish Brexit legal adviceComment: Staying in her bunker and ignoring Boris will not save Mrs May from the Brexiteer threatSir Philip Green faces three new US harassment claimsThe four charts that prove why Donald Trump is right to call the midterms a ‘tremendous success’ Central line tube strike: The useful walking map to help commuters facing disruptionUS midterm elections 2018: Why these congressional elections matter How the balance of power in the US Senate could change after today\u0026#39s midterm electionsComment: Midterm results offer Donald Trump a populist path to 2020 US election victorySacha Baron Cohen brings back Borat to tamper with the mid-termsPensioner, 98, fighting for life after \u0026#39brutal and senseless\u0026#39 attack in his Enfield homeSir Philip Green scandal: Gagging British accusers \u0026#39making mockery of law\u0026#39WATCH: Bus narrowly avoids landslide in PhilippinesComment: The \u0026#39rainbow\u0026#39 Democrats still have nothing to offer America\u0026#39s working class – women or menWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"midterm elections everything need know democrats take house","story":"Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives at the midterms on Tuesday, but gained strength in the Senate, following a night of mixed results for both sides.Republicans are celebrating holding off some high-profile Democrat challenges - Beto O\u0027Rourke failed to unseat Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, and Andrew Gillum failed in his bid to become the first black governor of Florida, losing to the stridently pro-Trump Ron DeSantis.But Democrats are celebrating winning control of the House of Representatives after picking up more than 26 seats.  With 412 of the 435 seats counted, Democrats had 219 and Republicans had 193.In the Senate, with 96 of the 100 seats decided, Democrats had 43 and Republicans had 51, with two independents.Donald Trump, the US president, said the results were a triumph but in reality, the picture was more nuanced.Blue-collar voters and rural America embraced his aggressive talk and stances. However, the new Democratic House majority will end the Republican dominance in Washington for the final two years of Mr Trump\u0027s first term - with major questions looming about health care, immigration and government spending.The president\u0027s party will maintain control of the executive and judicial branches of the government, in addition to the Senate, but Democrats suddenly have a foothold that gives them subpoena power to probe deep into Mr Trump\u0027s personal and professional missteps - and his long-withheld tax returns.Here\u0027s all the big news from overnight at a glance. While they took more than 23 House of Representative seats, the massive blue wave that could have swept Democrats into both chambers against the odds never materialised. Pundits suggested that while Democrat voters were really fired up, so were Republicans.Despite huge war chests for their campaign funds and a historically unpopular president, Democrats failed to pick off several key seats which would have indicated they were on course for a landslide. The Senate - composed of 100 people, two from each state elected for six-year terms - is generally referred to as the upper chamber.But that doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s more important than the House of Representatives, and the 435 people who sit in in.It\u0027s the House that sets the legislative agenda. They will prevent Mr Trump from enacting more tax cuts, or bringing legislation to repeal Obamacare.It can also launch subpoena-powered investigations into the president’s finances, Russian interference, administration ethics scandals, and halt the conservative legislative agenda in its tracks.They could even demand Mr Trump’s long-concealed tax returns.And it\u0027s the House that begins impeachment proceedings.In August, congressional Republicans, in a bid to make the president aware of how much was at stake, compiled a lengthy, unsettling list of possible topics that a new Democratic majority could investigate.“These demands would turn the Trump White House into a 247 legal defense operation,” said Jonathan Swan, of Axios news.The Senate, by contrast, sees the inidual Senators work much less as a pack, and wield more power as iniduals. They can filibuster - delay votes - and block nominations for key posts.In sum, it\u0027s the House of Representatives that is likely to cause Mr Trump the most headaches for the remaining two years of his first term. He\u0027s never had to deal with oversight from an opposition-held chamber.Democrats vowed to exert aggressive oversight over the Trump administration if they regained the House - which would give them control over the chamber\u0027s powerful committees.They are likely to launch investigations into everything from the president\u0027s tax returns to his links to Russia. At a victory party in Washington DC, Nancy Pelosi - the highest ranking Democrat -  promised accountability.House of Representatives - US mid term election results barDonald Trump has seized on the result, tweeting about the tremendous success after Republicans increased their majority in the Senate.He declared on Wednesday morning that it was a Big Win.The president had put himself front and centre of this election, telling voters to imagine he was on the ballot and undertaking a marathon campaign offensive in the months leading up to polling day.He also retweeted praise from pundits. Beto O\u0027Rourke\u0027s bid to carry out the biggest political upset in the Senate\u0027s history by turning Texas blue also proved unsuccessful.While the Democrat gave Republican senator Ted Cruz a nail-biting election night, ultimately Mr O\u0027Rourke\u0027s pro-immigration, pro-gun control and pro-impeachment stance proved fatal in the deep-red state.No upset: Beto O\u0026#39Rourke makes his concession speechTuesday has proved a night of political firsts in America, with the first openly gay male governor - Jared Polis, for Colorado the first Muslim Congresswomen - Rachida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota - and the youngest ever Congresswoman (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29) all elected into office.Deb Haaland, in New Mexico, is the first ever Native American woman elected to the House, while Sharice Davids, in Kansas, is the first lesbian Native American ever elected to Congress.Massachusetts elected its first black congresswoman, and Tennessee got its first female senator.Women hold more than 85 seats in the House - a record.And regardless of who wins in Arizona\u0027s competitive Senate race, the state will elect either Republican Martha McSally or Democrat Kyrsten Sinema as the state\u0027s first woman to serve in the chamber. In Vermont Christine Hallquist failed in her bid to become America\u0027s first transgender state governor on Tuesday night. But she is the first transgender person to win a major party nomination for a governorship in a progressive year for US politics already marked by record numbers of lesbian, gay and transgender candidates. In all, 43 transgender candidates have run for political office at all levels this year.More than 100 women are also projected to sit in the House of Representatives for the first time in history. With ballots still being counted across the country, voters were on track to send at least 99 women to the House, surpassing the previous record of 84. According to data compiled by The Associated Press, 237 women ran for the House as major-party candidates this year.Nancy Pelosi at a victory party in WashingtonThe majority of gains are among the Democrats.Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican senator, admitted his party would have to address its “suburban women problem” as the Democrats gained seats.Pollsters predict this election cycle is likely to set turnout records for a midterm election.Analysis has already shown a huge swell in early voting, with more than 38 million Americans voting before Tuesday – a huge rise on the 27 million who did so in the last comparable election, the 2014 midterms.In 2010 a total of 96 million voted in the midterms. The votes are yet to all be counted, but that total has already been surpassed.There were a few big names among the results tonight.Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney returned to front-line politics after winning a Senate seat in Utah.Mike Pence\u0027s brother Greg picked up the Vice President\u0027s former House seat in Indiana. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders and a few potential Democratic presidential candidates - Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gilibrand - were all re-elected to the Senate.January 3 is the day when all new and returning Congress members will take up their roles, to serve in the 116th Congress. The 115th is still in session, and will run until January 3.Before then, you can expect a huge amount of jostling for position. Nancy Pelosi is expected to be chosen by the Democrats as the leader of the House - although she is a controversial figure.And Democrats will decide who will chair their committees - weighty roles in Washington. They will then set out their priorities.Mr Trump\u0027s problems are only just beginning.Please review our commenting policyUS midterm elections live: Donald Trump congratulates himself on \u0026#39Big Win\u0026#39 - latest news and reactionBritish Army veteran who cleared IEDs in Syria reunited with stray dog he found cowering in Raqqa rubble House of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpA night of firsts: Meet the winners who have made history in the 2018 midterms US midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpWhat is impeachment and how long does the process take?Theresa May faces mounting pressure from all sides to publish Brexit legal adviceComment: Staying in her bunker and ignoring Boris will not save Mrs May from the Brexiteer threatSir Philip Green faces three new US harassment claimsThe four charts that prove why Donald Trump is right to call the midterms a ‘tremendous success’ Central line tube strike: The useful walking map to help commuters facing disruptionUS midterm elections 2018: Why these congressional elections matter How the balance of power in the US Senate could change after today\u0026#39s midterm electionsComment: Midterm results offer Donald Trump a populist path to 2020 US election victorySacha Baron Cohen brings back Borat to tamper with the mid-termsPensioner, 98, fighting for life after \u0026#39brutal and senseless\u0026#39 attack in his Enfield homeSir Philip Green scandal: Gagging British accusers \u0026#39making mockery of law\u0026#39WATCH: Bus narrowly avoids landslide in PhilippinesComment: The \u0026#39rainbow\u0026#39 Democrats still have nothing to offer America\u0026#39s working class – women or menWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"night firsts meet winners have made history 2018 midterms","story":"The face of US Congress is set to change dramatically after America sent its most erse group of candidates yet to Washington.Record numbers of women and ethnic minorities ran for office in 2018, paving the way for a number of historic landmarks on Tuesday night.The first Native American and Muslim congresswomen are heading to the House of Representatives, and Massachusetts has its first black congresswoman, while Arizona and Tennessee are getting their first female senators.Some of Tuesday\u0027s black female pioneers, like Illinois Democrat Lauren Underwood, were first-time candidates.

He has declared victory already.The US president, tweeted his delight in the early hours of Wednesday, and then was up to celebrate the results at 6:30am ET (11:30am UK), saying that he had received a string of congratulatory calls.With 412 of the 435 House of Representative seats counted, at 7am ET (midday UK), Democrats had 219 and Republicans had 193.In the Senate, with 96 of the 100 seats decided, Democrats had 43 and Republicans had 51, with two independents.The results of Tuesday\u0027s vote mean that the Republicans no longer hold both wings of the US Congress, handing Mr Trump’s political opponents a stronger foothold in Washington from which to oppose his presidency. The Democrats now have the numbers to veto Mr Trump’s proposed laws in the House and launch a string of damaging investigations into his administration through the committees they will control. House of Representatives - US mid term election results barHowever in the Senate it was a different story, with Republicans unseating a string of Democratic senators up for re-election in states Mr Trump won in 2016. It indicates many of the president\u0027s supporters are still with him two years into office.  Projections suggested the Republicans could even increase their majority in the Senate, allowing them to push ahead with controversial judicial and cabinet appointments with less fear of rebellions. Mr Trump, quick to put his spin on a night of mixed results, tweeted: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: “Anybody that was anticipating a blue wave tonight is not going to get it.In some of the most closely watched races, Democrats lost out.  Beto O\u0027Rourke, who had become a pinup for American liberals by running a surprisingly competitive race in Texas, ultimately fell short, with Ted Cruz winning re-election as the state\u0027s senator. The Republicans held the Senate after the midtermsAndrew Gillum, the left-leaning Democrat who was hoping to become Florida’s first ever black governor, was also defeated, narrowly losing to Trump acolyte Ron DeSantis.  A number of historic landmarks were reached, with the first Muslim congresswomen, first openly gay male governor and the youngest ever congresswoman (aged 29) all being elected.The story of the night was that of two different battles playing out – one for control of the House and another for the Senate.  In the House races, all eyes were on America’s suburbs. Democrats quickly made gains but failed to pick off seats which would have indicated they were on course for a landslide. The US midterm elections 2018, in picturesOne Republican senator close to Mr Trump, Lindsey Graham, admitted the party would have to address its “suburban women problem” as the Democrats gained seats. Their control of the House will be a huge headache for Mr Trump. His legislative agenda will grind to a hold, with the chances of securing new funding for his US-Mexico border or another tax cut significantly diminished. The White House is also braced for Democrat-controlled House committees to launch many probes that could damage the president on everything from his tax returns to ties to Russia, using their power to order witnesses to testify.  Nancy Pelosi, the woman expected to become the new Democrat Speaker of the House, said in a celebratory speech that Wednesday would be a “new day in America”, adding: “We’ve all had enough of ision.” However in the Senate, it was a different story. Here just a third of senators were up for re-election and the map heavily favoured Republicans, with many Democrats running in states Mr Trump won in 2016.  In the end, Republicans appeared on course to exceed expectations. Democrat incumbents were ousted in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, while Republicans held seats in Tennessee and Texas. With some states still to call, it was certain Republicans would hold the Senate majority and likely they would increase it by a few seats – a win which the president is sure to seize upon.  Mr Trump was credited with energising his voters, countering the enthusiasm displayed by the Democrats.It meant any hopes of a historic landslide from Mr Trump’s opponents soon faded as results filtered in. Mr Graham said Mr Trump should be “proud” of firing up his base, adding: “President Trump is well on his way to getting re-elected.”Just in from Bookmakers.tv - they think the money is on Beto O\u0027Rourke for 2020, despite his failing to beat Ted Cruz in the race for the Senate.Beto O\u0026#39Rourke, with his wife Amy, concedes defeat in TexasBeto O’Rourke emerges as standout Democrat candidate for 2020 and is now the main threat to Trump following energised campaign in Texas, as he’s the clear second favourite behind Trump in 2020 betting and strong favourite in Democratic candidate race.Democrats has nudge ahead of Republicans in 2020 winner betting, now 45 (from evens), becoming clear favourites for the first time.One of the most interesting things to watch will be how Donald Trump copes with having a hostile House.Until now the House has been controlled by Republicans, who have helped him along. That\u0027s all changed.One of the ways he may try to get around that is through the use of executive orders. Mr Trump loves them - signing them with great pomp and ceremony even when they are not necessary (as with the ending of the child separation policy - that didn\u0027t need an executive order, but he signed one anyway, in a televised performance).Our data journalist Patrick Scott has pulled together the statistics on his use of executive orders.Executive Orders signed per year in officeFor the first time in American political history a congressional election is poised to go to a run off. In sparsely populated northern Maine  neither Republican Bruce Poliquin nor Democrat Jared Golden secured more than 50 per cent of the vote.The outcome will be decided on voters’ second preferences. This is because Maine’s electorate backed the introduction of a system known as Ranked Choice Voting in a referendum in 2016.A guest at a Republican election night party in IndianapolisMr Poliquin has refused to rule out challenging the result should he lose in the run off despite having won more votes than his opponent on the first preferences. As things stand he polled 46.1 per cent and Mr Golden 45.8 per cent. Despite its remoteness, the district is of some additional interest because Maine is one of two states - the other is Nebraska - which splits the presidential electoral college vote. Northern Maine went for Donald Trump in 2016.Tuesday\u0027s midterm elections marked two years since Donald Trump\u0027s shock election victory – the first test of how his Republican party is faring in the eyes of the American public.The midterms is the name given to the combination of elections for the US Congress, governorships and other state-wide races that take place every two years.Before Tuesday, Republicans controlled the House of Representativesand the Senate – the two chambers which make up the US Congress. But a so-called “blue wave” saw Democrats poised to take control of the House.A liberal base hoping to derail Mr Trump\u0027s agenda has energised activists in key races, out-fundraising and out-polling a host of Republican incumbents.Although Mr Trump is not on the ballot, in many ways the results will be seen as a referendum on his accomplishments and how voters feel about the US president.The battle for Georgia governor was one of the toughest, and nastiest, in the country.Stacey Abrams is hoping to become the first black woman to govern a US state.Stacey Abrams, campaigning in Georgia. She is still hoping to force her rival into a run-offAt 5am ET (10am UK) 99 per cent of the votes have been counted, but Abrams is refusing to concede - she wants to wait until all the absentee ballots are counted.Under state law in Georgia, the leading candidate must receive more than 50 per cent of the vote to avoid a runoff electionGiven the expected deadlock in Congress now that the two chambers of government are split, Mr Trump could be tempted to wield his executive pen even more.Executive Orders signed per year in officeGlobal shares are mixed this morning, reflecting uncertainty over the implications of the midterm elections.While the outcome of the vote was largely expected, it does potentially complicate Mr Trump\u0027s legal troubles and policymaking agenda. It was unclear how the ided Congress might impact Trump\u0027s pursuit of an America first trade strategy that has drawn the world\u0027s two biggest economies into a trade war.European and U.S. futures are struggling to make up their mind as investors digest the implication of the midterm election, said Naeem Aslam of Thinkmarkets.One thing is for certain, the midterm election was mainly about Trump. President\u0027s policies have ided the country and this was the first major political test of his presidency, he said in a commentary.Europe seemed encouraged by the results: France\u0027s CAC 40 rose 1.3 percent to 5,141.65, while Germany\u0027s DAX added 1.2 percent to 11,620.55.

Donald Trump is right: \u0027Tremendous success tonight\u0027.US singers and actors have been reacting to the results from the midterms.John Legend celebrated the restoration of voting rights for some felons in Florida. Bon Iver congratulated Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat who was re-elected Senator in Wisconsin. Billy Eichner, the comedian and actor,  was delighted by the election victory of Jared Polis, who became America\u0027s first openly gay governor in Colorado. And Bette Midler gave her verdict on the re-election of Ted Cruz in Texas.White House aides have called on Democrats to work with Republicans in the next Congress.I don\u0027t know that there will be much of an appetite for Democrat lawmakers to spend all of their time, or most of their time or even a fraction of their time investigating, instigating, trying to impeach and subpoena people.Mr Trump called House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, a conversation that her office said included congratulations and a nod to her pitch for bipartisanship.In addition to his conversation with Ms Pelosi, the president called Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as a number of candidates he backed during the race, the White House said.It\u0027s official - Democrats have won a House majority.Democrats picked up at least two dozen House seats on Tuesday, capturing the 218 seats needed to break Republicans\u0027 eight-year hold on the House that began with the tea party revolt of 2010.While Republicans retained control of the Senate, the Democratic win in the House ends the GOP monopoly on power in Washington and opens a new era of ided government.Democratic candidates flipped seats in a host of suburban districts outside Washington, New York, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver, including many that were won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.Democrats also made inroads in Trump country, winning several races dominated by white working-class voters.The Nevada race has been called for Jacky Rosen, offering Democrats pickup in the Senate to offset their losses so far, writes Rob Crilly.Some factors behind the result: The day was marked by very high turnout. All the signs suggested voters were highly mobilised.At the Republican party tonight, I spoke to a number of people who said they were worried that Donald Trump\u0027s hardline immigration rhetoric would not play well in Nevada, with its high Hiic population and immigrants working in the hospitality industry.The Democrats had a very effective vote machine in the form of the Culinary Union Local 226, who deployed hundreds of workers to make sure that registered Democrats turned up and voted.All of it suggests that Democrats are on course - largely through Demographics - to turn the Sun States, such as Texas and Arizona, blue in the years to come. In another gubernatorial contest, the close fought race in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams was seeking to become the first black woman to be elected governor of a US state, remained too close to call early on Wednesday. Abrams, 44, was locked in a tight battle with Republican Brian Kemp, the state\u0027s secretary of state. There was a minor party candidate also in the race, and under Georgia law, if no candidate exceeds 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers advance to a December runoff election.By 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT), Kemp held a three-point lead, but Abrams told her supporters that she expected a runoff once all votes were counted.I promise you tonight that we are going to make sure every vote is counted, she said. We are still on the verge of history, and the best is yet to come.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has been defeated by Democrat Tony Evers, denying the polarising Republican and one-time presidential candidate a third term.Evers\u0027 win on Tuesday is a huge victory for Democrats, who couldn\u0027t find the recipe to take out Walker in three previous elections, including a 2012 recall.Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin, was defeated on TuesdayEvers campaigned on the promise of cutting middle-class income taxes, eliminating a tax credit programme for manufacturers and possibly raising the gas tax to pay for roads.Evers is a former teacher who\u0027s been state schools superintendent since 2009. He turned his understated personality to his advantage in the campaign, arguing that voters were tired of isiveness and yearned for more collegial politics.The Democrats\u0027 gains tonight have big implications for the Russia investigation, and for Silicon Valley, writes Laurence Dodds.Being in control of the House of Representatives gives Democrats the power to appoint committee heads. Previously, the House intelligence committee was chaired by Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist who has continually battled the Mueller investigation and who has received campaign donations from executives at Oracle, one of the more Right-leaning tech companies. Now it will be Adam Schiff, a Democrat who has been much more outspoken about the Valley\u0027s role in misinformation. (Mr Schiff has also received donations from Oracle, but not from the executives who gave to Mr Nunes.) He has called on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to hire more moderators to police their services, and accused them of doing the minimum amount necessary to handle the problem. He has also warned that more needs to be done to stop foreign interference and that social media companies must go against their economic interests to be good corporate citizens. When the US Senate called Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans to testify earlier this year, it made headlines. Perhaps now the House will seek a bigger piece of the action.Of the remaining seven Senate seats yet to be called, four are classed as toss-ups: Arizona, Florida, Montana and Nevada. Florida and Montana are projected to turn Republican, according to US networks, as the Democrat incumbents struggle to hold on in states Donald Trump won in 2016.In the House, the Democrats have won at least 208 seats with more than 30 still to be counted.An estimated 114 million votes were cast in the House election, smashing the 83 million cast in 2014 according to the New York Times. Senate results currently show that 40.7 million votes have been cast for the Democrats while the Republicans have 31.6 million. These numbers may change as more results come in through the morning.Beto O\u0027Rourke gave an emotionally charged concession speech at his election night event at a baseball stadium in El Paso, Texas, Nick Allen writes.Mr O\u0027Rourke said he had called Ted Cruz to congratulate him and quieted boos from the crowd at the mention of Mr Cruz\u0027s name. He said he had promised to help Mr Cruz in any way possible to represent Texas. To a large cheer Mr O\u0027Rourke then told his supporters: I\u0027m so f------ proud of you guys.He added: No-one thought this was possible to create a campaign for people from all walks of life. This campaign has a special place in the history of this country. I\u0027m forever change in the most profoundly positive way. I believe in you, I believe in Texas, I believe in this country.I\u0027m as inspired, I am as hopeful as I have ever been in my life. This country is in no way diminished at this moment. I know we will continue to work to come together. To chants of Beto, Beto he left open the possibility of a future electoral campaign. I love you more than words can express, he said. We\u0027ll see you out there down the road. Mr O\u0027Rourke left the stage to John Lennon\u0027s Imagine. Some of his supporters left the baseball stadium in tears.In a night of political firsts, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar have become the first two Muslim women to be elected to the US Congress. Ms Tlaib called Donald Trump\u0027s election a bat signal for women when I interviewed her last month, you can read the full piece here.Kristi Noem has become South Dakota\u0026#39s first female governorElsewhere, Democrat Janet Mills was elected Maine\u0027s first female governor, defeating Republican Shawn Moody and putting seat back in Democratic hands. South Dakota also voted in its first female state governor with Republican Kristi Noem defeating Democrat Billie Sutton. New Mexico Democrat Deb Haaland and Kansas Democrat Sharice Davids were elected the first two Native American women to serve in Congress.Women will break the current record of 84 serving at the same time in the House of Representatives.With ballots still being counted across the country, women have won 75 seats and are assured of victory in nine districts where women are the only major-party candidates.The majority of gains are among the Democrats. From the Women\u0027s March opposing President Donald Trump the day after his inauguration in January 2017, through a stream of sexual assault accusations later that year that sparked the #MeToo movement, outrage and organising by women have defined Democratic Party politics this election cycle.More than 230 women, many of them first-time candidates, were on the general-election ballots in House races.Despite the gains, men will continue to hold the vast majority of House seats.I’m at an election night party in a cinema in Oakland, California, a liberal neighbour city of San Francisco where the Black Panthers once had their stronghold.It would be hard to find a pro-Trump party in this city, but California in general is not just a lock for the Democrats. Republicans are defending the 10th House district, east of San Jose, and the 25th, where the Republican incumbent had distanced himself from his party’s hard line on immigration. Other blue targets include Orange County outside Los Angeles, which has become competitive due to the arrival of more Asian and Latino Americans, and the 50th district outside San Diego, where Republican Duncan Hunter was made vulnerable by allegations of misusing campaign funds.In the cinema, there were huge cheers and whoops for Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who look very likely to become the first Muslim women in Congress. Ms Omar came to America decades ago as a refugee from Somalia, while Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants.There were also loud boos for the narrow victory of Ron DeSantis over Andrew Gillum in the race to be governor of Florida – and for Diane Feinstein, the Democrat who many Leftists feel is not too centrist (My girlfriend observes: “It’s like a pantomime!”).“We’ve been so much on the defensive, so hopefully this puts us in a position if being more offensive, more strategic,” said Democrat supporter Emma Ishii.It could be some time yet before we know the outcome of the Senate race here in Nevada, Rob Crilly writes. This was supposed to be the big seat for Democrats - a state they won in 2016 giving them the best chance of unseating a Republican incumbent. But we already know that Republicans will hold the Senate, whatever the result here.Voting was supposed to finish almost two hours ago. But there were long lines at polling centres, delaying the close of voting.Dean Heller, the Republican senator, just addressed his supporters here in Las Vegas, thanking the president for making multiple visits to Nevada.“Our message is good,” he said. “Our message here in America is good. Look at what this economy is doing thanks to this president and this Republican Congress that put American and Nevada back to work.”Republican Josh Hawley wins Missouri Senate race, ousting Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill. Another heavy loss for the Democratic party in the Senate.It was as much relief as celebration, Rob Crilly writes. After days of quietly fearing the worst, Republicans in Nevada are beginning to think this could be a good night.  The quiet hum at their party in the South Point Hotel and Casino in Law Vegas gave way to whoops and cheers as Fox News called the Texas Senate race for Ted Cruz, which effectively means the party retains control of the Senate.Depending on how our local races go, this could be a good night, said Joe Ludwig, who works in medical customer services. Just breaking even feels good at this stage. There\u0027s no wave and a few extra seats in the Senate could help the president, even if he loses the House.Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in the House, is speaking at the party\u0027s headquarters in Washington. We\u0027ve all had enough of ision, she says to loud cheers. Mrs Pelosi went on to promise accountability, saying Democrats will strive for bipartisanship.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi arrives to celebrate Democratic House wins“Thanks to you we owned the ground,” she says. “Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America. Remember this feeling. Note the power to win.”Donald Trump has praised the tremendous success for his Republican party in tonight\u0027s results. However the White House has called a lid for pool reporters, meaning the president will not speak tonight. Andrew Gillum has conceded defeat in Florida\u0027s governor race against Republican Ron DeSantis, in what was one of the most vicious campaigns of the year.  Mr Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor, had been hoping to become the state\u0027s first African American governor. The bitter campaign had included accusations of dog whistle politics, but Donald Trump made several trips to the state to stump for Mr DeSantis.This is an important result for Mr Trump, Florida is America\u0027s most populous swing state and governors have huge sway over mobilising party activists and raising donations for the 2020 presidential race.The Texas senate result was called while a band was on stage at Beto O\u0027Rourke\u0027s election night party, Nick Allen reports. The crowd was listening to an accordionist as news spread by way of social media on phones. When the band finished a silence fell. There were some, rather half-hearted chants of Beto, Beto.It was a shock for a lot of the first-time voters who had packed into a baseball stadium in El Paso firmly believing their candidate was about to pull off an historic upset. Not long before the race was called Ted Cruz\u0027s campaign had indicated they thought they were in for a long night. When the result came his supporters at an event in Houston burst into chants of We want Ted! We want Ted!Democrat Heidi Heitkamp has lost her senate seat in North Dakota, losing to Republican Kevin Cramer. This was a crucial target for Republicans in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Ms Heitkamp became one of the most endangered Democrats in the Senate after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court nomination.Many of tonight\u0027s results were predictable. The Democrats have done well in the House, which was inevitable given Trump’s low approval rating, two years of controversy and the continued shift of suburban voters to the Democratic column. But the Republicans have also done well in the Senate – in part thanks to Democrats defending incumbencies in states that favoured Trump (Indiana, North Dakota etc). In other words, the Republicans have had luck and math on their side.One notable exception is here in Pennsylvania where it looks like the Republicans have been cut down from 15 out of 18 House seats to a paltry 6. This was due in part to a court-ordered redistricting.Both sides will have to confront substantial challenges. Would the Democrats have done even better if they had moved to the centre? It has been suggested that Beto O’Rourke could have won Texas if he had courted Ted Cruz’s voters, but he didn’t. He went pro-immigration, pro-impeachment, pro-gun control. As for the Republicans, what do they do about Trump? He has identified and energised a populist coalition that snagged him the presidency – but he has also placed limits on where the Republicans can win state-by-state. The exit polls suggest large parts of the country resent his rhetoric on immigration and feel the country is headed in the wrong direction. Given that the economy is so strong, they presumably mean it is becoming too isive and violent.We’ll see where things stand in the morning. I’m going to try to sleep but there’s a party in the tavern downstairs. I’m using CNN as white noise to drown it out.I\u0027ve arrived at the Republican election night party in Las Vegas. It\u0027s the same place they saw in the 2016 election result - I wonder if they are superstitious. There\u0027s a degree of realism in the air. Most expect to lose the House tonight. But limiting Democrats to a majority of 15 or fewer, and holding the Senate would go down as a good result.Rising left-wing rock star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made history on Tuesday as the youngest woman elected to Congress, in a safe Democratic Party stronghold in New York.The 29-year-old has championed her working class and Puerto Rican roots, moonlighting as a bartender until defeating a Democratic grandee in a party primary earlier this year, capturing imaginations around the country.On Tuesday, she trounced Republican opponent Anthony Pappas in her constituency, a Democratic stronghold in a erse part of Queens and the Bronx.The \u0027s US Editor, Ben Riley-Smith, spent a day out on the campaign trail with her earlier this year. Read his profile of the young Congresswoman here.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to CongressMs Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s win beats the previous record held by Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a former White House aide to president George W Bush who was first elected to an upstate New York constituency in 2014 aged 30.Before that, the last record was last set by former Democratic representative Elizabeth Holtzman in Brooklyn, who won a seat in the House in 1972 when she was 31 years old and took her seat in 1973.Women occupy just 23 percent of the seats in the current US Senate and 19.3 percent in the House of Representatives, comparatively low rates in the developed world.Republican Ted Cruz has held onto his senate seat in Texas, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O\u0027Rourke. Democrat Jared Polis has been elected Colorado\u0027s governor, defeating Republican Walker Stapleton. Mr Polis is the country\u0027s first openly gay male governor.Having picked up two new Senate seats, NBC is predicting the Republican will maintain their control of the chamber. Meanwhile Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is projected to lose her senate seat in North Dakota. If this is true, it extremely unlikely the Democrats can take the Senate.Republican Mitt Romney has won a senate seat in Utah after returning to front line politics, defeating Democrat Jenny Wilson. Mr Romney has been something of a thorn in Donald Trump\u0027s side, frequently criticising the president in public.Mitt Romney has regularly criticised the presidentHe ran against Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election and took a back seat from national politics for a while after his defeat.Speaking outside the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared to be conceding Republicans may have lost control of the House. Asked about that possibility of a Democratic takeover, she said: The president\u0027s agenda isn\u0027t going to change regardless of whose party is there.Three Democratic senators have held onto their seats.Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has won a second term, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has won a third term, defeating Republican Jim Newberger and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico has also won re-election, defeating Republican Mick Rich. Nick Allen has an update from Texas:With 58 per cent of the vote in Ted Cruz and O’Rourke both have more than 2 million votes - and O’Rourke is ahead...by just 79. This could be an absolute nailbiter.The suburbs of Houston are still to come in and could be good for the Democrat. But Cruz has been campaigning a lot there, and he lives in Houston. He’s also got a lot of reliably red rural areas to come in.O’Rourke has hired out a baseball stadium in El Paso for his election party. Supporters, many of them very young, are pouring in to the stands and a DJ is playing on a stage erected on the outfield. It’s an untraditional election night event.The USA appears – touch wood – to have made it through the midterms without a major cyberattack targeting election infrastructure, Laurence Dodds writes.Matthew Prince, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Cloudflare, said his company hadn\u0027t seen any such incidents. Perhaps it helped that the Pentagon had given US government hackers authority to retaliate against any nation which attempted one.But the vote has not been free of foreign information operations – that is, political campaigns run using deceptive methods such as bots, fake accounts and false identities. Although most such activity now comes from Americans, Facebook said this morning that it had blocked around 30 accounts after a tip-off from authorities involving foreign entities. Separately, an app created by the comedian Samantha Bee which allows users to report attempts at voter suppression has received 800 such reports, including claims of vigilantes hanging around the polls trying to intimidate people.Fox News has projected a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Whether this projection, so early in the night, will hold true remains to be seen.Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly has lost his senate seat in Indiana, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence. The winner, Republican Mike Braun, has picked up another crucial seat for his party. This was a key target for the Republicans and Mr Trump campaigned in the state multiple times, returning again on his final day of rallies on Monday.Early results are showing the Republicans holding on to some House seats Democrats had hoped to flip, suggesting the predicted \u0027blue wave\u0027 is failing to materialise.Republican businessman Bill Lee is elected Tennessee governor, defeating Democratic former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean. But in Illinois, Democrat JB Pritzker has managed to unseat the incumbent Republican governor Bruce Rauner. In more predictable results, Republican Greg Abbott of Texas, Democrat Andrew Cuomo of New York, Democrat Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania re-elected and Republican Larry Hogan of Maryland were all re-elected as state governors. Republican Mark Gordon will by Wyoming\u0027s next governor. Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming has been  re-elected to the Senate. Democrat Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has won a third Senate term, beating Republican challenger Lou Barletta.  Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi has also won re-election, defeating Democrat David Baria.Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has been re-elected in West Virginia, defeating Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey. This was the most pro-Trump state of the 2016 election, and a key target for Republicans this year. This is a personal loss for Mr Trump, who campaigned in the state multiple times in the run up to Tuesday\u0027s election. Democrat senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been re-elected in New York. Ms Gillibrand has been touted as a future presidential candidate.Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey has been re-elected to third term, defeating Republican Bob Hugin. It was a surprisingly close race given the state is traditionally blue. Mr Hugin had distanced himself from the president, calling his plan to end birthright citizenship wrong. Greg Pence, the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, has been elected to Congress in Indiana. He was running in the Vice President\u0027s former seat in Indiana\u0027s 6th district, a staunchly Republican area.Polls have closed on America\u0027s east coast, with a number of battleground House and Senate races remaining competitive. What are the results so far?Democrat Sherrod Brown has been re-elected to the Senate in Ohio, defeating Republican Jim Renacci. In his victory speech, Mr Brown said his win should be “the blueprint for our nation in 2020” - prompting speculation about the 2020 presidential election.Republican Charlie Baker has been elected to serve a second term as Massachusetts governor. He defeated Democrat Jay Gonzalez, who was hoping to become the state\u0027s first Hiic governor. Elsewhere Republican Asa Hutchinson has won a second term as Arkansas governor, defeating Democrat Jared Henderson. In Rhode Island, Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo has won a second term, defeating Republican Allan Fung. Mr Fung was hoping to become the state\u0027s first Asian governor.This analysis from Joshua Wilson on our data team:According to the latest exit poll from CNN, the top issue on voters minds as they headed to the ballot box on Tuesday was health care, with 41 per cent of voters listing it as their top issue.Health care is the top issue for voters in this years mid termsIn previous years the economy has been the top issue which has played to the strengths of the Republicans, but health care favours the Democrats much more strongly and they have campaigned heavily on this topic. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Murphy of  Connecticut, Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, Tom Carper of Delaware, and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island have all been re-elected for another six-year term, according to the Associated Press.Democrats have seized a House seat in Virginia with Jennifer Wexton predictably defeating incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock. Virginia 10  is a district which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. This is a key signal of how the Democrats are going to fare in the suburbs. Our own Nick Allen visited Virginia 10 last week to see how Donald Trump\u0027s Republican party was going down with suburban, female, college-educated voters. Read his dispatch here.Elsewhere in Virginia, Tim Kaine, Mrs Clinton\u0027s running mate in 2016, has been re-elected to the Senate. Mr Kaine comfortably beat Republican Corey Stewart. Bernie Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, has been re-elected as a senator in Vermont. Mr Sanders ran as an independent candidate with the Democratic party\u0027s backing, as he has done in previous years.Bernie Sanders has been re-elected for another six-year term in the US SenatePresident Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are watching the results at the White House with friends and family.This in from Sarah Sanders, the White House Press Secretary:  “As President, Donald J Trump has headlined an unprecedented 50 rallies — 30 in the last two months alone — and he has campaigned for dozens of candidates at all levels of government. The President has energised a staggering number of Americans at packed arenas and in overflow crowds at rallies across the country.Under President Trump’s leadership, the Republican National Committee has raised more than a quarter billion dollars, fueling an extraordinary ground game geared toward defying midterm history and protecting the GOP’s majorities.He has made the choice clear to the American people: Tonight, we can continue down the path of American prosperity and security or we can go backwards. The President and First Lady look forward to watching the results come in with friends and family in the White House residence.” Please review our commenting policyBritish Army veteran who cleared IEDs in Syria reunited with stray dog he found cowering in Raqqa rubble House of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpA night of firsts: Meet the winners who have made history in the 2018 midterms US midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpMidterm elections: Everything you need to know about what happened overnight and what happens nextWhat is impeachment and how long does the process take?Theresa May faces mounting pressure from all sides to publish Brexit legal adviceComment: Staying in her bunker and ignoring Boris will not save Mrs May from the Brexiteer threatSir Philip Green faces three new US harassment claimsThe four charts that prove why Donald Trump is right to call the midterms a ‘tremendous success’ Central line tube strike: The useful walking map to help commuters facing disruptionUS midterm elections 2018: Why these congressional elections matter How the balance of power in the US Senate could change after today\u0026#39s midterm electionsComment: Midterm results offer Donald Trump a populist path to 2020 US election victorySacha Baron Cohen brings back Borat to tamper with the mid-termsPensioner, 98, fighting for life after \u0026#39brutal and senseless\u0026#39 attack in his Enfield homeSir Philip Green scandal: Gagging British accusers \u0026#39making mockery of law\u0026#39WATCH: Bus narrowly avoids landslide in PhilippinesComment: The \u0026#39rainbow\u0026#39 Democrats still have nothing to offer America\u0026#39s working class – women or menWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg","title":"apple macbook air review best laptops 2018 specs price display battery","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsThe latest Apple laptop is gorgeous and capable\u0026nbsp– and a fitting update to a successful favouriteClick to followThe Independent TechThe MacBook Air\u0026nbspchanged how people saw lightweight laptops when it was first announced 10 years ago, revealed when then Apple CEO Steve Jobs slid it out of a manila envelope.It was very expensive then, but over the years, the original design became the entry-level Apple laptop.

That super-slim profile which sloped down to an impossibly thin edge? That\u0027s what this laptop looks like when the lid is closed. It\u0027s a little smaller in most directions. It used to be 32.5cm wide, now it\u0027s 30.41cm. Before, it was 22.7cm deep, but this has shrunk to 21.24cm and its height (its thickness when closed, in other words) has gone from 1.7cm to 1.56cm at its thickest. Note, though, that the thinnest measurement of all, that uncannily thin lip, has actually crept up from 0.3cm to 0.41cm now. In other words, it\u0027s smaller in every direction except at the very edge where it\u0027s all of 1.1mm thicker. Big deal. Oh, and it\u0027s dropped from 1.35kg to 1.25kg in weight.This means it\u0027s the lightest Apple laptop apart from the MacBook (0.92kg).The point is that compared to the previous MacBook Air it\u0027s improved, apart from a tiny bit extra on the thinnest measurement, which I defy anyone to notice. That\u0027s before we get to the colour, which was silver only until now. The new model also comes in space grey, as well as a fruity, peachy gold shade to the aluminium that continues to make up the laptop\u0027s structure.The Apple logo is no longer backlit, instead it\u0027s a reflective metallic apple, carefully colour-matched to the aluminium frame around it. This\u0026nbspbrings the MacBook Air into line with the design language of the other latest MacBook and MacBook Pro models.It looks tremendous, a perfect balance between small body size and big screen, thanks to the tiny bezel that runs round the display. This bezel is nothing compared to the wide silver frame around the display which was required when the first model arrived.The connectivity has been updated, too. There\u0027s no SD card slot, no USB-A ports and no wonderful MagSafe power connector. Only the headphone socket is carried over to the new laptop. What\u0027s new is the same Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connector found on the MacBook, used for data transfer and charging. Except this laptop has two of them, which is a very big improvement. It\u0027s not the super-useful four sockets that are found on the MacBook Pro, but it\u0027s a very welcome upgrade.The other visual difference is the trackpad, which is noticeably larger on this new laptop. And it\u0027s a Force Touch pad, that is, it gives the impression of moving when it\u0027s only a persuasive haptic feedback that\u0027s fooling your finger. This is one of the most noticeable changes to the laptop, once you\u0027ve stopped admiring the thin dark bezel and all-glass covering that succeeded the silver aluminium frame.The 13.3-inch screen is now –\u0026nbspfinally! –\u0026nbspa Retina display. Instead of the 128 pixels per inch (ppi) on previous similarly-sized MacBook Air screens, this has leapt to 227 ppi. To say this makes a difference is an understatement. Actually, it\u0027s more that if you used the MacBook Air, it was fine until you glanced at a recent MacBook or MacBook Pro with their glorious Retina displays, and then you simply didn\u0027t want to go back. Now, the MacBook Air has joined the Retina club.It\u0027s unquestionably the upgrade Air users waiting to replace their laptop have been aching for over the last few years. There are more colours available on this screen\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp48 per cent more, Apple says –\u0026nbspand in this respect also, the improved display is a big step forward.Since the display has been upgraded, you may very well want to watch video on it –\u0026nbspafter all, it\u0027s bigger than the largest iPad screen, and almost as high-resolution. So, you\u0027ll be glad of the improved audio. Apple says the new stereo speakers offer twice the bass and an extra 25 per cent of volume compared to the last model. I haven\u0027t measured it, you understand, but it absolutely sounds better and definitely loud. There are three microphones on board, which is useful because this laptop supports hands-free Siri, of which more later.It may look just like the old keyboard but wait until you try it. To be fair, the original MacBook Air keyboard was a sumptuously comfortable user experience which some feel has never been bettered. The new keyboard was clickier and noisier. This is the third-generation of the new butterfly-mechanism keyboard which is noticeably quieter than the second-gen. And, unlike the previous MacBook Air, this one is now in line with the other Apple laptops, with inidually backlit keys. Of course, you\u0027d expect the processor to be cutting-edge. It is, and although in everyday use the previous MacBook Air was perfectly fast enough, this is noticeably more capable and speedier, even down to simple things like opening files and launching apps. When I first saw the second-generation MacBook Air, all those years ago, I was told that battery life was excellent and plugging it in all day long just wasn\u0027t necessary. That\u0027s just as true today and in the week or so that I\u0027ve been testing the laptop, it\u0027s lasted more or less a full day with ease. Important in a laptop as portable as this one. The processor is powerful enough to let you talk to your computer. Say Hey, Siri from across the room and it\u0027ll respond. Only the most recent MacBook Pro models can match this. Although it lacks the super-cool Touch Bar of high-end MacBook Pro models, the MacBook Air has stolen another excellent feature: Touch ID. Nestled to the right of the function keys is a tiny, glossy square. Register your fingerprint and you can unlock it with one touch. This is a brilliantly intimate way to open your Mac, quicker and simpler than a password and only beaten for ease by unlocking with the Apple Watch. You can use Touch ID for Apple Pay, too, when you\u0027re paying for stuff online. It\u0027s made of aluminium. Well, that\u0027s normally not much of a thing to focus on. But this MacBook Air is the first Apple device to be made from 100 per cent recycled aluminium. The bits left over when other MacBooks, iPhones and iPad are created have been turned into this new laptop thanks to Apple metallurgists working on how to create a new alloy that can be re-used effectively. Note that the colour of the laptop is identical to the colours used in non-recycled Macs –\u0026nbspa sign of the success of this alloy. It means the carbon footprint is half that of the last MacBook. Apple uses smelting processes which are less harmful than some manufacturers in the first place, but now, with this laptop, no smelting has been necessary at all, which is a definite bonus for the environment.Which MacBook should you buy?That\u0027s an interesting question. The new MacBook Air sells for £1,199, that\u0027s £50 cheaper than the cheapest MacBook, which has a smaller display, older processor and lacks some of the best features of the new Air such as an extra USB-C socket, Touch ID and hands-free Siri. On the face of it, it\u0027s a no-brainer: why spend more for a less advanced machine?The only reason is portability –\u0026nbspthe MacBook is small and significantly lighter than the Air. You really feel the difference when you\u0027re holding both, though neither is exactly heavyweight. If you\u0027re happy with the weight of the Air (and pick it up in store to see for yourself) then the Air wins out in every other department, from its glorious screen to its extra speed and features. And if you want the cheapest MacBook of all, the Air with its previous design, is still available, for £949. This older model is likely to remain a keen choice for the budget-conscious for some time to come. Mind you, the new one is way better in every single respect (unless you really need an SD memory card slot, and –\u0026nbspyou know what? – there are dongles for that).Unless you need something super-light, the MacBook Air is the best choice. Unless you need advanced processing power that only the MacBook Pro can deliver, the MacBook Air is the best choice. The new model is pricier than the old, but it offers a great balance between power and portability. The new design is cute, especially the new gold finish, and the addition of Touch ID is a genuine advantage. Most of all, it\u0027s a reminder that in the last 10 years, not much has happened to overtake the design ethos of the MacBook Air, apart from a better screen, faster processor, slimmer bezel, better connectivity and improved security in the form of Touch ID. All of which are included here.The new MacBook Air was a hugely popular laptop. Goodness knows we\u0027ve been waiting a long time for this upgrade, but it\u0027s here, and Apple has delivered the goods.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Fairburn is leaving “by mutual agreement and at the request of the company”, according to a statement to the London Stock Exchange, and will depart his role at the end of the year. The building boss was awarded the\u0026nbspbonus as part of a long-term incentive plan, which effectively hands over 9 per cent of Persimmon’s shares – worth hundreds of millions of pounds – to senior managers over a decade.Persimmon chief’s meltdown shows the value of good PR advicePersimmon boss Jeff Fairburn heats up £75m bonus scandalPersimmon boss shuts down interview, refusing to discuss £75m bonusPersimmon: Will £100m CEO Jeff Fairburn accept blame if roof falls in?He was originally granted a £100m bonus, but after a public backlash agreed to reduce that sum by 25 per cent. However, Mr Fairburn recently walked out of an interview after being questioned about the payout, leading to further publicity about the bonus, by far the largest paid to the boss of a public company in the UK last year. Persimmon said on Wednesday that the board “believes that the distraction around his remuneration ... continues to have a negative impact on the reputation of the business and consequently on Jeff’s ability to continue in his role”. Mr Fairburn said: “It has been an honour to lead Persimmon through an exciting period of development.\u0026nbspI had hoped that revealing my plans to create a charitable trust and to waive a proportion of the award would enable the company to put the issue of the 2012 LTIP behind it. “However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down. I wish the company the very best for the future.”David Jenkinson, currently group managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive on 31 December, and the board has begun a formal recruitment process to hire a permanent replacement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The retail giant plans to announced the new chairman in the second half of next year. Sir Charlie is the fifth chairman of JLP, and has held the role since 2007. He said: “Although my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. John Lewis is killing off the DVD playerIt is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership.”John Lewis has not been immune from the general gloom that has pervaded the British high street in 2018. Earlier this year, the group revealed that profits had been all but wiped out, and announced a number of store closures. At the time, Sir Charlie said: “These are challenging times in retail. We’re continuing to improve our offer for customers while ensuring we have the financial strength to continue developing our business going forward.”The company has been struggling as rival retailers have applied heavy discounts in a bid to withstand the downward trend in consumer spending. This puts John Lewis under pressure because of its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ policy, which meant the company has seen an unprecedented level of price-matching this year.

Now a site in Gillingham in Kent will go, along with hundreds of jobs there.\u0026nbspA Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “Lloyds Banking Group has today announced that it will create an additional c.2,000 roles, as it strengthens its capability to offer customers new leading-edge digital banking products and services.\u0026nbsp“The Group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure, while also providing comprehensive retraining for colleagues to help them build their capabilities to meet the demands of these future roles.Llouds said the latest announcement was part of a £3bn commitment it\u0026nbspmade to invest heavily in technology and staff.\u0026nbspLloyds reported\u0026nbsppretax\u0026nbspprofits of £1.8bn last quarter but is pressing on with plans to cut costs and adapt its business.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “As the profits stack up for Lloyds, so does the uncertainty for loyal staff who work hard to serve customers. This latest announcement will undoubtedly hit the morale of staff who have had to endure round after round of job cuts, branch closures and constant upheaval.“The news of additional jobs will prove to be a bitter pill for workers at Lloyd’s Gillingham site closure. These hard working staff face limited opportunities for redeployment, while other workers around the country could effectively be forced out of a job because they are unable to travel or move to where the new roles are located.“Unite will be pressing Lloyds to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and ensuring that staff who move into new roles are given the support and skills that enable them to continue delivering the best possible customer service.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, he said: “We have heard a number of times from university leaders that if they got into financial trouble then ‘they would be OK because the OfS would bail them out’. Professor criticised for saying Israelis blew up World Trade Center“This is wrong. This kind of thinking – not unlike the ‘too big to fail’ idea among the banks – will lead to poor decision-making and a lack of financial discipline.”Sir Michael told a conference of leaders in the university sector that bailouts would be “inconsistent” with the principle of university autonomy and it would not be in the “students’ longer-term interests”.His comments to vice-chancellors and management teams of higher education institutions come amid reports that a number of universities are on the verge of bankruptcy. Sir Michael called on institutions at risk of failure to be open about financial difficulties with the regulator before it is too late. “There will be no bailouts but there will be other solutions from A and B,” he said. Speaking to the press after his speech at Wonkfest, he said: “Universities are autonomous institutions largely – they are controlling their student numbers, their courses, whatever they put on. Sometimes they are borrowing money on the market to build buildings or whatever else they want to invest in. “If you make those decisions thinking ultimately you will be bailed out by the Office for Students, then you might make a different decision.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Adrian Lester, Sir Lenny Henry, Ade Adepitan, Nadine Marsh-Edwards, Marcus Ryder and Meera Syal, as they deliver a letter, signed by a string of stars, to 10 Downing Street, calling for tax breaks to effect change and boost ersity behind the cameraEU nationals, living in the UK take part in a demonstration along Whitehall.

But he said: “We do not see it as the government’s role to bail universities out when they make reckless financial decisions.”The University and College Union (UCU) said the regulator should not wash its hand of universities if things go wrong and argued institutions have a wider impact on jobs and opportunities in local areas. Matt Waddup, head of policy and campaigns at UCU, said: “In places like India and China they are opening new universities. Do the regulator and minister really want to voluntarily reduce our country’s intellectual, social and cultural capital?”He added: “Michael Barber’s comments demonstrate just how out of touch those in charge of our universities really are. “You don’t protect students’ interests by bringing about the demise of their local university. It would not simply be a case of students moving to another university if theirs were to experience financial trouble.”The UCU will be writing to MPs with a university in their constituency asking if they back plans to allow their institution to go bust. “The regulator and government should be supporting universities to excel, not washing their hands when things don’t go to plan,” Mr Waddup said.Office for StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In recent months, its price has been relatively stable and is currently trading at around $0.26 (£0.20), however Stellar\u0027s current transaction volume is less than 2 per cent of bitcoin\u0027s.Speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon on Tuesday, 6 November, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith explained his vision for spreading awareness and usage of cryptocurrency.We\u0027re doing this because we want you to truly\u0026nbspunderstand crypto, he told the audience.\u0026nbspAnd the only way to truly understand it is to use it.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Fairburn is leaving “by mutual agreement and at the request of the company”, according to a statement to the London Stock Exchange, and will depart his role at the end of the year. The building boss was awarded the\u0026nbspbonus as part of a long-term incentive plan, which effectively hands over 9 per cent of Persimmon’s shares – worth hundreds of millions of pounds – to senior managers over a decade.Persimmon chief’s meltdown shows the value of good PR advicePersimmon boss Jeff Fairburn heats up £75m bonus scandalPersimmon boss shuts down interview, refusing to discuss £75m bonusPersimmon: Will £100m CEO Jeff Fairburn accept blame if roof falls in?He was originally granted a £100m bonus, but after a public backlash agreed to reduce that sum by 25 per cent. However, Mr Fairburn recently walked out of an interview after being questioned about the payout, leading to further publicity about the bonus, by far the largest paid to the boss of a public company in the UK last year. Persimmon said on Wednesday that the board “believes that the distraction around his remuneration ... continues to have a negative impact on the reputation of the business and consequently on Jeff’s ability to continue in his role”. Mr Fairburn said: “It has been an honour to lead Persimmon through an exciting period of development.\u0026nbspI had hoped that revealing my plans to create a charitable trust and to waive a proportion of the award would enable the company to put the issue of the 2012 LTIP behind it. “However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down. I wish the company the very best for the future.”David Jenkinson, currently group managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive on 31 December, and the board has begun a formal recruitment process to hire a permanent replacement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The retail giant plans to announced the new chairman in the second half of next year. Sir Charlie is the fifth chairman of JLP, and has held the role since 2007. He said: “Although my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. John Lewis is killing off the DVD playerIt is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership.”John Lewis has not been immune from the general gloom that has pervaded the British high street in 2018. Earlier this year, the group revealed that profits had been all but wiped out, and announced a number of store closures. At the time, Sir Charlie said: “These are challenging times in retail. We’re continuing to improve our offer for customers while ensuring we have the financial strength to continue developing our business going forward.”The company has been struggling as rival retailers have applied heavy discounts in a bid to withstand the downward trend in consumer spending. This puts John Lewis under pressure because of its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ policy, which meant the company has seen an unprecedented level of price-matching this year.

Now a site in Gillingham in Kent will go, along with hundreds of jobs there.\u0026nbspA Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “Lloyds Banking Group has today announced that it will create an additional c.2,000 roles, as it strengthens its capability to offer customers new leading-edge digital banking products and services.\u0026nbsp“The Group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure, while also providing comprehensive retraining for colleagues to help them build their capabilities to meet the demands of these future roles.Llouds said the latest announcement was part of a £3bn commitment it\u0026nbspmade to invest heavily in technology and staff.\u0026nbspLloyds reported\u0026nbsppretax\u0026nbspprofits of £1.8bn last quarter but is pressing on with plans to cut costs and adapt its business.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “As the profits stack up for Lloyds, so does the uncertainty for loyal staff who work hard to serve customers. This latest announcement will undoubtedly hit the morale of staff who have had to endure round after round of job cuts, branch closures and constant upheaval.“The news of additional jobs will prove to be a bitter pill for workers at Lloyd’s Gillingham site closure. These hard working staff face limited opportunities for redeployment, while other workers around the country could effectively be forced out of a job because they are unable to travel or move to where the new roles are located.“Unite will be pressing Lloyds to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and ensuring that staff who move into new roles are given the support and skills that enable them to continue delivering the best possible customer service.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It works by throwing out an array of 30,000 infrared lights, which hit the holder\u0027s face – a sensor in the camera can then see where they fall and check whether the right person is holding the phone.Cheaper, colourful version of latest iPhone finally goes on saleBut when the light is especially bright – on a sunny day, for instance – those invisible lights within the phone can get thrown off and the facial recognition sensor can have trouble seeing its owner.The new feature will improve that by better illuminating people\u0027s faces. The new sensor and its better lights will lower the impacts from visible lights of environment in order to improve the Face ID user experience, according to the report first spotted by\u0026nbspMacrumors.In addition to those new features, the updated version of the Face ID sensor could also allow it to use time of flight calculations to make 3D models of the things it is looking at. That technology works by throwing out a piece of light and seeing how long it takes to bounce back, and then using that to work out the distance – similar to something like radar.If Apple were to integrate that, it would allow the phone to use its modelling software to create augmented reality features to improve tools like the Animoji feature, for instance.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But as they scrambled to research it, the rock made its way out of the other side of our solar system, giving researchers only a glimpse to make the most of.In that short time, astronomers established that the object was moving strangely. It was spinning very quickly as it flew through the solar system, and seemed to speed up rather than slow down as it went.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

If so, that might have happened by accident – or the object might in fact be a spacecraft made by an alien race, they said.Alien asteroids could have brought life to Earth from spaceThe object might be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilisation, the researchers write.It is not the first time that astronomers have suggested the rock could potentially be an alien spacecraft. Soon after it was discovered, researchers with the Breakthrough Listen project announced they would be monitoring it and seeing if it was sending out radio signals.The new study, written by\u0026nbspShmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from the Harvard Smithsonian Centre\u0026nbspfor Astrophysics, looks at the way that solar radiation could be used to power the object as it flies through space. They calculate that it would have to be very thin but very wide – and that such a shape would be possible.If they are right that the object is being propelled by radiation pressure from the sun, then it will be a breakthrough even if it is entirely natural. Such an object would be of a kind never before seen, most likely formed by an entirely unknown process happening deep in space.But it might in fact be artificial in origin, they write. One\u0026nbsppossibility is that ‘Oumuamua\u0026nbspis a\u0026nbsplightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment, the authors claim, and it might be unused debris that has\u0026nbspbeen thrown out into space from a planetary system.Such an explanation would account for the various strange characteristics of Oumuamua, including the unusual shape it seems to have.Scientists on Earth have already looked to develop that kind of technology, which would be used to make tiny spacecraft that could be shot through space at intense speed and be pushed only by light. It might already have been developed elsewhere, they write, and could be used for transporting cargo between planets or even between stars.But even more strange is a theory that the rock could have been sent here on purpose. Alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that ‘Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization, they write.Oumuamua is now too far away from Earth for scientists to understand any more about it. But more could be found by looking into the solar system for more objects of this type, the authors say – which could happen more in coming years, as new ways of surveying the sky are turned on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They\u0026nbspalso get\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspcask of sherry and an annual honorarium of £5,750.\u0026nbspA panel of literary experts is set to present a shortlist to the secretary of state at the DCMS and the prime minister, who will make a final decision to put forward for the Queen.Benjamin Zephaniah says he was violent towards former girlfriendsBenjamin Zephaniah tells Theresa May to ‘fix up’ amid Windrush scandalLoyle Carner and Benjamin Zephaniah talk art, dyslexia and ShakespeareZephaniah is an outspoken critic of the monarchy and previously turned down an OBE in 2003, commenting: “OBE, me? Up yours, I thought...I get angry when I hear that word “empire” it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised.”Responding to his candidacy for poet laureate, the poet, author, actor and musician\u0026nbsptweeted: “I have absolutely no interest in this job. I won’t work for them. They oppress me, they upset me, and they are not worthy.“I write to connect with people and have never felt the need to go via the church, the state, or the monarchy to reach my people. No money. Freedom or death.”The poet John\u0026nbspAgard\u0026nbsphas also criticised the way the laureate is chosen, telling the\u0026nbsp:\u0026nbsp“I’m certain that the prime minister is very familiar with the iambic pentameter. But since poets don’t have the final say in politics, logically speaking there’s no reason why politicians should have the final say in poetry.”Cope, who was strongly favoured when Andrew Motion was appointed in 1999, has also ruled herself out, having previously called for the position to be abolished in 2009.In her 10 years, Duffy – the first woman and the first Scot to hold the post – wrote poems to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch (the last two British soldiers to fight in\u0026nbspWWI), the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Recently she composed “The Wound In Time” to mark the\u0026nbsp100th\u0026nbspArmistice Day next weekend.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Firstly, a withdrawal agreement – solving separation issues like Ireland, the orce bill\u0026nbspand citizens rights. But Theresa May has also promised a separate “political declaration” – a detailed outline of what Britain’s future trade relationship with the EU will look like, mostly on trade.It is this latter agreement that outlines whether Britain intends to join a customs union, follow single market\u0026nbsprules, or sign a free trade agreement – and whether to adopt models like Norway or Canada.\u0026nbspDelays and missed deadlines in negotiating the withdrawal agreement,\u0026nbspparticularly on the Irish border issue,\u0026nbsphowever means that negotiations about the nature of the future relationship have effectively not even started.To make matters worse, Theresa May’s opening Chequers proposal was rejected as unworkable by the EU’s 27 remaining countries, and the prime minister has said she will not accept any other offer on the table.Given the deadline to have everything agreed was October, it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how a substantial future relationship could be negotiated in time for the parliamentary vote.Hauliers face ‘lottery style’ allocation for permits under no-dealGovernment post-Brexit environment plans ‘do not replace all EU laws’May forced to call Varadkar to calm Irish anger over borderRemain would win new Brexit referendum by eight points, poll suggestsUnder laws passed by MPs earlier in the Brexit process, both the withdrawal agreement and political declaration must be presented to MPs before any vote can take place.Ahead of his meetings in Brussels, Sir Keir\u0026nbspsaid: “This is crunch time in the Brexit negotiations. Yet government isions and delays mean that little time has been spent debating what our future trading and security relationship will be after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“Months of deadlock in Theresa May’s government mean we’re facing continued uncertainty and the prospect of years of further negotiations over our future relationship with the EU.\u0026nbsp“A blind Brexit could prolong business uncertainty and provide insufficient guarantees to protect jobs, the economy and rights. Whether you voted Leave or Remain, nobody voted for the purgatory of permanent negotiations.“Theresa May and Dominic Raab promised that the Brexit deal put before parliament will be ‘detailed, precise and substantive’. That is exactly what Labour expects and what I will be discussing in Brussels. If the final deal it is anything less than the government has promised, Labour will not support it.”Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The Chequers-type deal, as I say, if we don’t have friction with trade, then, economically, I don’t think it’s going to make a particular big difference one way or the other.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Adrian Lester, Sir Lenny Henry, Ade Adepitan, Nadine Marsh-Edwards, Marcus Ryder and Meera Syal, as they deliver a letter, signed by a string of stars, to 10 Downing Street, calling for tax breaks to effect change and boost ersity behind the cameraEU nationals, living in the UK take part in a demonstration along Whitehall.

Yet government isions and delays mean that little time has been spent debating what our future trading and security relationship will be after Brexit.Months of deadlock in Theresa May\u0027s Government mean we\u0027re facing continued uncertainty and the prospect of years of further negotiations over our future relationship with the EU.

Whether you voted leave or remain, nobody voted for the purgatory of permanent negotiations.Theresa May and Dominic Raab promised that the Brexit deal put before Parliament will be \u0027detailed, precise and substantive\u0027.That is exactly what Labour expects and what I will be discussing in Brussels. If the final deal is anything less than the Government has promised, Labour will not support it.Yesterday Theresa May promised her top ministers she would not rush into a striking a Brexit deal with Brussels at any cost, as pressure grows for a resolution.She told the Cabinet any exit agreement will be dependent on an acceptable framework for future relations in areas like trade and security, which will be covered in a separate political declaration.Brexit BOOST: Dominic Raab \u0026lsquothumbs up\u0026rsquo after CRUNCH meeting causes pound to ROCKETBrexit: Sir Keir Starmer has warned against the dangers of a loose deal as he meets with EU chiefs (Image: )Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer is to meet EU chiefs today  (Image: Leon Neal Getty Images)Sir Keir said the agreement must provide detailed answers on future trade, customs, immigration, security, research and collaboration and repeated warnings that Labour would vote against anything less.A hard-talking three-hour meeting of the Cabinet focused heavily on how to keep the Irish border free-flowing after Brexit.The EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier denied an agreement was close and suggesting he had not even heard of the latest potential breakthrough on the Irish question.The key sticking point in exit talks is the backstop contingency plan to avoid re-establishing a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit, if a permanent solution has not been found.Talks are centred on a scheme that would keep the UK in the EU customs union temporarily, avoiding the need for new checks on cross-border trade.The UK insists any such arrangement cannot trap Britain against its will and there must be a way for it to get out if trade talks with Brussels break down.UK \u0027almost CERTAIN\u0027 to end up in HARD Brexit because of \u0027infighting\u0027, Mandelson claimsConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said May could struggle to get her deal through Parliament (Image: Matt CardyGetty Images)Some ministers and MPs further insist that Britain must have the power, without EU approval, to end any customs union membership - a demand Ireland and the EU are resisting.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tories, has underlined the struggle Mrs May could have to get her deal through Parliament.He said there no extension of the customs union would be acceptable - and the Government must reveal how it calculates any analysis on the impact of a deal.The phoney figures used to justify parts of Mrs May\u0027s Chequers Deal trade plan showed we can\u0027t trust Treasury analysis, he said.Therefore the Government must show its workings to Parliament.

In 1998, she had a stroke.The following year, she spent several weeks in the hospital after scalding her feet in a bathing accident that limited her mobility for the rest of her life.Princess Margaret died at the age of 71 on February 9th 2002, just seven weeks before the death of her mother on March 30th 2002.Elizabeth and Margaret had a close bond, despite their differing personalities and roles (Image: Getty)Margaret was born in Scotland in 1930 - the second daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.She was forbidden from marrying Captain Townsend because he was a orcee, something that caused great controversy in the press.After the end of their romance, Princess Margaret and her future husband, Anthony Armstrong-Jones, were introduced at a dinner party in May 1958.They got married in a lavish wedding at Westminster Abbey in 1960 and were later made Count and Countess of Snowdon.The royal couple had two children, Viscount David Linley in 1961 and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones in 1964.

Brexit could be REVERSED during transition period says EU politician                 Brexit LIVE: Fury at May\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret deal\u0026rsquo with EUI think the European Union\u0027s position has been clear from the beginning and they have held fast to their position.The British position has chopped and changed a bit. But, in the end, they will put together a compromise.The European Union would like the UK to remain the single market and customs union, that is the best outcome for the European Union, so as little change as possible.For the European Union, that means the UK in effect, by leaving the EU would actually only leave the voting forums, the European Council, the Parliament and so on.So the UK would have no say in the making of EU rules, but would apply all EU rules, that is by far the best outcome from the EU\u0027s point of view.But, of course, from the UK\u0027s point of view, that is the worst imaginable outcome because the UK gains nothing out of leaving the European Union and loses what it has at the moment which is the right to vote in the European Council and the European Parliament, and have people working in the European Commission, that is an absolutely hopeless outcome.In a sense that is where the European Union has begun, and for the UK, it quite rightly has begun, by saying we don\u0027t want to be in the single market or customs union, we want to be able to take advantage of the changes that Brexit will bring.Mr Downer added that if Brits had been given the choice in 2016 to leave the European Council and the European Parliament but continue to apply all EU laws and regulations, and be subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice, then you would have been lucky to get 10 percent of people voting for that.Brexit news: Alexander Downer warned the UK about the EU\u0027s best Brexit outcome (Image: )He added: It\u0027s fair to say that is clearly not the proposition that people had in mind.The people who voted to leave the European Union, don\u0027t like the European Union much for a lot of different reasons.They don\u0027t like Britain\u0026nbspbeing, in effect, a state in a greater super-national state, Britain becomes a region rather than a nation.They don\u0027t like the idea that they themselves can\u0027t control many aspects of their own domestic policy, because that is done by Brussels.Clearly that was their expectation when they went to vote. They thought that is what they would get rid of. That would still remain their expectation.Mr Downer, who also served as Australia\u0026rsquos High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018, urged Theresa May to remain tough and not shy away during negotiations.Earlier this week reports suggested the Prime Minister was considering allowing the UK to remain in a customs union to resolve the Irish border issue.The Irish border remains the major sticking point in orce talks, with Mrs May rejected the EU\u0027s proposed backstop - as it would effectively create a border down the middle of the Irish Sea.Following a crunch cabinet discussion on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary left the meeting giving a thumbs up to reporters after he was asked how the meeting went.Mr Raab reportedly went to the meeting hoping to ensure the UK has the ability to be able to quit any proposed Irish backstop with a few months notice.On Monday Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejected Mrs May\u0026rsquos calls for any agreement to include a mechanism to bring an end to the backstop - designed to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if the UK and EU fail to reach a broader trade deal.

Egypt: 800 tombs discovered back to Pyramid of GizaThey now think the postholes were a key feature of the equipment which allowed hundreds of workers to haul giant blocks of stone more quickly than previously understood.It has long been theorised that the Egyptians used a system of ramps to help construct the Pyramids but the new finding suggests the ramps were steeper.This helps to lend weight to the theory the Egyptians used a complicated system of pulleys allowing builders to push and pull the blocks of stone with greater speed and ease.Roland Enmarch, a senior lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool and a co-director of the project that discovered the postholes, said the system has revolutionised theories about ancient Egyptian builders.Archaeologists think they might have solved the mystery of how the pyramids were built (Image: )He told the : \u0026ldquoThe system we have discovered would allow more people to exert force at one time, so it means you would be able to exert more force and move the blocks more quickly.The discovery was made in September meaning Dr Enmarch and his fellow director of the Institut Francais d\u0026rsquoarcheologic Orientale (IFAO), Dr Yannis Gourdon have yet to publish the findings in any peer-reviewed journal but added they intend to.Dr Enmarch said the alabaster quarry where the discovery was made has been known to Egyptologists since it was found by Howard Carter, the archaeologist who found the tomb of Tutankhamun.According to Dr Enmarch, his team had been in the quarry to document and study inscriptions but became fascinated by how it was constructed and if there was anything they could learn about how it compared to the construction of the pyramids.                Ancient secrets of Egyptian black sarcophagus finally REVEALED                Egypt village discovered older than Great Pyramid of GizaThe newly discovered system has revolutionised theories about ancient Egyptian builders (Image: )The inscriptions in the quarry allowed the team to date the ramp and postholes to around the time of the Pharaoh Khufu who built the Great Pyramid of Giza, the last remaining of the seven wonders of the ancient world.Dr Enmarch added that there was no evidence in the quarry to confirm the theory, it would be reasonable that if such technology existed at the time it would have been used on the Great Pyramid itself.Meanwhile, Egypt\u0026rsquos tourism minister has said the country has seen a sharp increase in the number of visitors coming to marvel at the Pyramids.Overseas visitor numbers had plummeted in recent years due to the turmoil in the country following the Arab Spring in 2011 but annual tourist numbers are on course to top 10 million for the first time since 2012.Construction of a new mega museum is underway near the Great Pyramid of Giza (Image: )Rain Al-Mashat, Egypt\u0026rsquos tourism minister, told Reuters: \u0026ldquoIn 2017 we closed the year at around 7.5 million (visitors).

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to new polling by YouGov, only three per cent of us think we aren’t handing the taxman enough — and just  per cent that most people pay too little.It’s hardly surprising. For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work. But people will only workit pays them to do so.The job for the politicians is to make damn sure it does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We do not believe that this is acceptable, he said.The committee argued said the current timetable for rollout was unrealistic and needs to be urgently reconsidered - and the system for switching people over would be extremely complicated.On top of these announcements was a £.billion a year packages to push the work allowances up - meaning Brits will be able to get an extra £ a year from next April.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Backstop means backstop.“Today we’re not there yet. Frankly we don’t have the advantage of a lot more time.”Downing Street said leaked plans for a media blitz of foreign leaders, business chiefs and Whitehall wonks to try sell the PMs deal was not a genuine government document.The timetable, riddled with spelling errors, set out a day by day attempt to win over MPs ahead of a crunch Commons vote pencilled in for  November.It included bringing in Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and the CBI to endorse her plans and predicted a moment of decisive progress would be announced by Brexit Secretary.However No rejected the timetable and a Whitehall source added the assumption is that someone took crude notes at the back of a war gaming meeting which have been going on for at least a couple of weeks.In a further headache for the PM last night, the powerful ERG bloc of Brexiteer Tory MPs warned they any Treasury statistics used to try browbeat them into backing a deal could not be trusted.Jacob Rees Mogg told fellow hardliners: the Government must show its workings to parliament.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you are a hard working parent, sometimes even in the morning, I know some people put their kids in front of the TV in the morning, is that safe I was thinking thatthey could put it in the cot it could be a lot safer.”He added the iPad didnt have to be on constantly.He said: It’s not to sit your child in the cot all day watching Peppa Pig.People who work for a living thought it was a great idea.Without me being nasty, people who would leave their kid in the front room all day were hammering it.With the growing culture of smart phones, more and more people are peering at technology at night.But scientists have warned the blue light from your phone could have wide ranging implications.Blue waves are good during the day because they boost attention and reaction times, but can be extremely disruptive at night.The light plays havoc with our body clocks, with the light believed to be linked to affecting a persons circadian rhythm.It can also suppress the secretion of melatonin, affecting a persons mood.Researchers believe LED light, which emits mainly blue light, may disrupt the bodys internal clock and disrupt hormones to cause cancer.Experts have also warned too much screen time can raise the risk of a dozen deadly cancers as it fuels childhood obesity.*According to Hard HealthAnd he added he was merely giving people what they wanted.Mr Taylor said: Kids are stuck on their computers. That’s not my fault. That’s the way the generation is going. I’m giving people what they want.But parents took to social media to raise concerns about the built-in iPad design.Ana Belem said: “This is wrong on so many levels. There’s a limit for technology and this is just way over that limit!!! Shame on you.”Beth Cooper said: “Ffs! What is this world coming to, what a sick joke.”Danielle West added: “This has got to be a joke the most ridiculous thing ever. What’s wrong with reading singing talking about the day with your child to settle them for bed!”Research from the American Academy of Pediatricshas suggested it is the nature of screentime that is the most important factor.Jocelyn Brewer, a psychologist who specialises in the concept of ‘digital nutrition’, said: “It’s not just about whether you consume any potential digital junk foods, but also your relationship to technology and the role it plays in your family le.“We know that using screens to soothe or pacy kids sets up some concerning patterns of relying on devices to calm or distract a childfrom their experience of unpleasant or uncomfortable emotions – so we want to avoid using screens to placate tantrums, just like we want to avoid eating ‘treats’ to calm emotional storms.”"},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/11/2048x1152/skynews-oumuamua-alien-spacecraft_4477639.jpg?20181106085332 ","title":"emmanuel macron calls for real european army to defend against russia and us","story":"\"When I see President Trump announcing that hes quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s Euromissile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security,\" Mr Macron said.The Cold War Euromissile crisis, which saw the US roll ballistic missiles into Europe, was a major influence on the creation of the  Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\"We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army,\" Mr Macron said.

More than  women are on course to win election or re-election in races across the country. The wave of female candidates comes nearly two years after women in the US and around the world took to the streets to protest the inauguration of Donald Trump. The Democrats wrestled back the US House of Representatives after eight years of Republican control, with minority leader Nancy Pelosi set to be the next Speaker.  The huge win for the party was largely down to the number of female candidates who flipped the seats in their respective states.  Of the  women on ballots for the -seat U.S. Senate and  vying for the -seat House, more than  percent were Democrats, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “It’s a bit of a partisan story,” said Rutgers political science professor Kelly Dittmar. “This year we’ve seen a surge of women candidates that are both running for office and winning nominations, but much of that surge is happening among Democrats and not Republican women.”  Trump and his fellow Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate following a isive campaign marked by fierce clashes over race, immigration and other cultural issues.

Democrat Jenner Wexton defeated incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock in Virginia in one of the most closely-watched races across the country. After defeating a long-time incumbent in a shock primary, -year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders organiser, became the youngest woman elected to Congress.  Increased support from female voters gave Democrats the boost they needed in what has been dubbed the year of the woman. Fty-five percent of women said they backed a Democrat for the House this year, compared with  percent who in  said they backed a Democrat in the congressional midterm elections. Female candidates acknowledged the ground-breaking year in their victory speeches.  Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts tipped to run for president in , said Trump America had ushered a new generation of women into public le. After securing re-election, Warren said: Women who had never run for anything stepped up to put their names on the ballot. They ignored the party bosses who said they should wait their turn.

Buoyed by the success of the midterm elections, attention will now turn to the  presidential race. For the first time since the start of the  campaign, Democrats are entering the cycle without a dominant front-runner. More than two dozen possible contenders have had their names floated or have actively begun exploring their chances. President Donald Trump filed for re-election the day he was inaugurated in January , and his popularity with the Republican Partys core supporters means any possible challenge for the partys nomination will be a longshot.  Here are some of the potential contenders in each party: Democrats Joe Biden  The former vice president, , is the early Democratic leader in polls, and that is partly aof familiarity given his decades as a senator and eight years as Barack Obamas number two. If he makes his third run for the presidency, Biden will have easy access to top-shelf staff, donors and an extensive network of supporters. Bidens age could work against him in a party looking for fresher faces, and his ties with Obama would make him an easy target for Republican attacks. Bernie Sanders  The Vermont senator, , still has a loyal following from his  challenge to Hillary Clinton, and his focus on issues such as universal healthcare, reducing income inequality and tuition-free public college has been adopted widely by the party. But while he was an insurgent candidate two years ago, Sanders would face more intense scrutiny as a major contender in . Elizabeth Warren  The Massachusetts senator, , is a leader of the partys progressives and a fierce critic of Wall Street who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her recent decision to take a DNA test to prove her distant Native American ancestry after Trumps taunts of Pocahontas was roundly criticised and raised questions among some Democrats about her political agility. Kamala Harris  The first-term senator from Calornia, , is considered one of the candidates most likely to break out from the pack of lesser known Democrats. Her aggressive questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and her decision to swear off corporate PAC money - large donations from businesses - won her plaudits from activists. But as a newcomer to national politics, Harris still needs to introduce herself to the public while defying Republican attempts to define her negatively. Cory Booker  The two-term senator from New Jersey, , a former Rhodes Scholar and Stanford University football player, won notice as the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, when he saved a neighbor from a burning house in . Some liberals have criticised him for having close ties to Wall Street and for helping to kill a proposal that would have lowered prescription drug prices. Beto ORourke  The three-term congressman, , became a Democratic sensation with his underdog U.S. Senate campaign in deeply conservative Texas. He lost the race but smashed fundraising records running as an unabashed liberal and offering a possible template for Democrats in . ORourke is still untested on the national stage.Kirsten Gillibrand  The senator from New York, , was appointed to the Senate from the House of Representatives to replace Hillary Clinton in , when Clinton became secretary of state, and has become a leader in the #MeToo movement. Her statement last year that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency in the Monica Lewinsky scandal drew a rebuke from the former president, who said shes living in a dferent context, and alienated some Clinton allies. Michael Bloomberg  The former New York City mayor, and former Republican, has in the past considered running for the White House as an independent. But this time Bloomberg, , is considering running as a Democrat. His money and name recognition are formidable, and his advocacy for gun control has won him friends among activists. But progressives could find some of his positions hard to take, including his opposition to a Democratic proposal that would break up Wall Street banks and his doubts about the #MeToo movement. Andrew Cuomo  The New York governor, , easily defeated a primary challenge from the left by actress Cynthia Nixon in September. A big re-election win makes him a possible contender. Eric Holder  A close ally of Obama, he served as his first attorney general and has launched a committee to fight battles over redistricting, the drawing of district lines that can cement a partys hold on power. Holder, , drew rebukes from Republicans, and some groans from Democrats, when he said in October of Republicans: When they go low, we kick them. Thats what this new Democratic Party is about. He later told critics to stop the fake outrage. Amy Klobuchar  The two-term senator from Minnesota, , a former prosecutor, won praise from activists for her questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearing. He memorably turned the question back to her when she askedhe had blacked out from drinking. I dont know, have you  he asked Klobuchar, who had revealed that her -year-old father was a recovering alcoholic. Kavanaugh later apologised. Terry McAulfe  Like Biden, the former Virginia governor has broad access to donors and influential Democrats. McAulfe, , is a former chairman of presidential campaigns for both Bill and Hillary Clinton, and a former head of the Democratic National Committee from  to . Steve Bullock The Montana governor, , has asserted an interest in running for president with multiple trips to early primary states, including a well-publicized trip to the Iowa State Fair. He has emphasized the need for a national -state campaign, saying as a governor he knows how to reach across the aisle to get things done. Republicans Donald Trump  The president, , already has a campaign slogan, Keep America Great, and between his campaign committee and two joint fundraising committees has raised  million for his re-election, with  million cash on hand, according to campaign finance reports. He has turned his attention to the race, punctuating his political rallies with frequent put-downs of his possible Democratic rivals. John Kasich  After a failed presidential campaign in , the Ohio governor has become one of the partys few notable critics of Trump. Kasich, , a moderate on some social issues, has pointedly refused to rule out a primary challenge to the president. But Kasich is famous for his aversion to fundraising, which could make success elusive. Concerns about potential primary opposition from Trumps base have encouraged Kasichs allies to view him as a possible independent candidate.

Kirsty Maxwell, , was on a hen weekend in the Spanish resort when the tragedy happened. Her family has since supported an extensive probe into her death after it emerged five British men were staying in the apartment from which Kirsty fell. But samples taken from under the bank workers fingernails, hands and armpits contain no foreign DNA, experts have revealed. And it now paves the way for Ana Isabel Garcia-Galbis in Spain to consider ending her -month criminal probe. A well-placed source in the country said today: The family had placed their hopes in the possibility something was going to be found, some biological evidence linking Joseph Graham or the other suspects to what happened and supporting their foul play claim, and absolutely nothing has been found.  It was a comprehensive examination which included analysis of the underside of Kirsty’s nails to seesamples of someone’s  skin could be recovered that might suggest a struggle had taken place. All the tests came back negative. The absence of any incriminating DNA on Kirsty’s body means the case is a step nearer to being closed. No decision on closure is obviously going to be taken before the upcoming court hearings but bar some sort of unexpected surprise, things are a lot nearer that point now.  The five Brits being probed over Kirsty’s death, including -year-old Joseph Graham who was the only man arrested, would be spared trialthe case is closed and only a successful appeal by Kirsty’s family to a higher court could get it re-opened. Two of the men, from Nottingham, have been called to court today to give evidence. Eight police officers have been asked to attend a second hearing on Thursday November , which was originally understood to have been scheduled for October .  Both hearings will take place behind closed doors, as is customary in Spain where only trials take place in public. Kirsty, of Livingston, Scotland, died in April , just seven months after marrying Adam Maxwell. The grieving widower previously said: I won’t rest until I know the truth.

Officers from the politan Police said a Toshiba television and other items were taken from the home.  Detective Inspector Paul Ridley said on Tuesday evening: This was a brutal and senseless attack on a vulnerable pensioner in his own home. The level of violence used was completely excessive. From our inquiries we have established that the victim was spoken to by a family member on the telephone on Monday  November at pm and had not raised any concerns. We are therefore confident the attack has taken place in the -hour window between then, possibly Bonfire Night, to when he was discovered. I would urge any members of the public that may have seen any persons acting suspiciously in the vicinity of Evesham Road, Enfield, N, to come forward to my investigation team as a priority.

But how best to cook your potatoes can be a headache for whoever is in the kitchen. So to help answer this age-old culinary question, weve spoken to two expert chefs who know their way around the dish better than most. Weve called on top chefs from Toby Carvery and - with this Sunday being Remembrance Sunday - The Royal Navy, who between them serve up thousands of roast dinners for hungry civvies and troops every week. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  So we arranged for Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith to visit The Royal Navys galley on board HMS Northumberland to help rally the troops with a bumper feast alongside the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell - and give the rest of us a lesson in cooking the perfect roasties in the exclusive behind-the-scenes video above. Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James said he was proud of his restaurants long-standing commitment to the armed forces and championed the importance of people getting together to enjoy a meal - be it at home, away serving for their country or at their local Toby Carvery. He said: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate! And he went on to reveal the secret Toby twist to cooking the perfect roast potatoes.  Its all about the ruffling, he explains, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds. You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato.  The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell also lets viewers in on how to make fantastic gravy. He says: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in! Chef James finally lts the lid on how knock up fantastic Yorkshire puddings in the clip, adding: The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil.

The -hour walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transportand Aslef unions has halted all service on the Central Line through the capital. It also disrupted services on the Waterloo and City Line, commonly used in morning rush-hour by bankers and other City workers. The travel misery was worsened after a points failure delayed South West Trains services to and from London Waterloo, which typically handles more than , passengers every day. The RMT said the Tube dispute was over a comprehensive breakdown in industrial relations, a failure to employ enough drivers, abuse of agreed procedures and the victimisation of a trade union member.  Many expressed their anger on social media this morning. One commuter wrote: Remind me of why I pay so much for a season ticket when I have to stand from Worcester Park to Waterloo station  days a week  Another posted: Love being stuck in standstill traffic for  mins. Thanks to all those striking on the Central line. Mick Cash, RMT general secretary, said: RMT members are standing absolutely rock-solid and united theof the Central Line this morning as they send out the clearest possible signal that they will not be bullied into accepting a wholesale undermining of workplace justice and rights. Industrial relations along the Central Line have been at breaking point for some time now and the failure of the management to address the issues, and a conscious decision to up the ante by attempting to single out and pick off inidual members of staff, has tipped the situation over the edge and has led to the strike action today. The union is angry and frustrated that the management side have squandered a golden opportunity over the past week to resolve the issues at the heart of the dispute through the talks process. Todays action is the clearest possible demonstration to Tube bosses of the level of anger on the job and its down to them to take the situation seriously and engage in genuine talks around reaching a solution to the current disputes.

When the mum-of-one, from Howden, East Yorkshire, opened it she had to fish around before finding a white envelope containing her bright-red shoelaces. The -year-old told Hull Live that she was furious that such a large box was used to deliver such a small item, as the case highlights the problem of excess packaging from online orders.  Katie found that the laces could have fit into their packaging more than  times after they arrived on Monday. She is now urging companies to take more care in using the appropriate packaging over the Christmas period, feeling that they dont take the packaging of their products seriously enough. Katie said: This was disgraceful - I couldnt believe it and this is the last time I ever buy anything from Dr Martens.  I knew what was in it [the parcel] as soon as it arrived and couldn’t believe the size of it when I got home. I thought they’d sent me someone ’s parcel by accident. Someone mentioned the shipping charge would have been expensive and it could have been sent in an envelope. The funniest thing is the laces were placed in an envelope inside the box which doesnt make sense.  A number of retailers have been criticised for excessive packaging and councils have complained about the amount of discarded cardboard that can pile up at peak periods such as Christmas. Katie said: I want companies to understand this is not OK - with Christmas around the corner, people shouldnt be sent all this packaging which just goes to waste. Dr. Martens has been contacted for comment. In September, large firms were threatened with a so-called cardboard box tax to offset the cost of collecting and recycling discarded packaging. Councils are said to be spending tens of millions of pounds every year to dispose of cardboard from online deliveries.

A caring government would abandon Universal Credit, put up its hand and try to mend the broken benefits system. But these Conservatives don’t care about the victims they create. It feels like ministers enjoy revelling in the hardship inflicted, wrongly blaming the unfortunate for their plight.

Google Maps didnt update its satellite imagery of the area for nearly a decade. Between  and , the base in southwestern Nevada was shown on satellite images as a series of dry lake beds, but the real pictures were finally released following public outcry. The test range lies around  miles northwest of the infamous Area  facility, synonymous with UFOs and conspiracy theories, giving added weight to the latest spot to be highlighted by popular UFO YouTube channel SecureTeam. The video, uploaded on October , shows some kind of object poking out the front of an aircraft hangar, but its been blurred or censored at source.  We dont know what it is because they have completely blurred it out, the narrator says during the video. He also points out other military vehicles parked or stationed around the hangars, but they arent blurred out. Only this particular unidentied object is. We rarely, rarely see this, the narrator claims, so whatever this is, its extremely suspicious that they would go to the trouble [of blurring the object on Photoshop before uploading]. And not to mention its been found in the middle of a range that was also censored in satellite imagery for almost eight years, he continues. The video goes onto to allege that the wingspan of the object is probably similar to that of the Lockheed Martin RQ- Sentinel, said to be a US unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone. But the wingspan is actually larger, the narrator claims, and there have even been images of it [RQ-] posted online, so I highly doubt they would blur whatever this object isthere are already images of it.  You can watch a clip from the video above, and the full video here , and make up your own mind as to what the mysterious object is.

Ellen Santana, , scooped the top prize at the sexiest backside competition at the grand finale of the world famous competition in Satildeo Paulo. But before the surprise winner was able to give her victory speech, bitter rival Aline Uva ran on stage and ripped the winner’s ribbon from her body. Amid boos and catcalls from the crowd and other contestants she then launched into a tirade against the winner accusing her of having a “plastic” bottom. Aline, representing Rio Grande do Sul state, came into the Miss Bumbum final as favourite to clinch the title after polling the most online votes.But a  of judges in the live final placed her twelth.  Aline, , who refused to give back the winner’s ribbon, later told journalists: “I’m the only woman who deserves to be the winner.I played by the rules, and my bumbum is  per cent natural, unlike the winner who has a plastic bottom. “Miss Bumbum is a complete farce, and I’ve proved it. If it was a serious competition I would have won.” Winner Ellen later denied she had enhanced her cm-wide bottom with surgery, saying: “She took my ribbon but she can never take away my title. “I deserve this title because my butt is the firmest. But it’s not just about the bottom, it’s about character too, which I have and she doesn’t. “Now I want to be an inspiration to women around the world, to show them that they can achieve everything they dream of, whatever adversaries they face.” Second place in the world-famous bottom competition went to -year-old Flaacutevia Tamaio, an estate agent representing Brazil’s Distrito Federal.  And the first transexual ever to compete, Paula Oliveira, , came third - despite other contestants claiming she should never have been allowed to enter the competition, after she underwent sex change surgery six years ago. During last night’s long-awaited live final, hundreds of reporters and photographers packed the Eazy Club in Satildeo Paulo as the finalists were given two chances to impress a  of ten judges. The women first paraded wearing gowns before stripping off to their bikinis, with many leaving little to the imagination as they wiggled and thrusted their behinds in an attempt to win votes. Each judge gave a score between  and  for each of the women’s two appearances before votes were counted. But confusion broke out after the Ellen Santana, representing the state of Rondocircnia, was named the last contest’s surprise victor. As organisers tried to persuade bitter rival Aline to hand back the winner’s ribbon, the other women shouted: “Accept it, you lost. Ellen’s the champion. You’re a bad loser.”  Founder Cacau Oliver later said: “This is a competition where feelings run high, these fights are part of it. But it will be bad for her and for usshe doesn’t give back her winner’s ribbon.” Miss Bumbum has gained worldwide notoriety since the competition began in , with winners catapulted to overnight fame in Brazil. Each year thousands of women are whittled down to , each representing a Brazilian state, before a public vote sends  through to the live final. But founder Cacau Oliver announced that last night’s event would be the last of its kind, as the franchise concentrates on launching Miss Bumbum competitions in other countries such as Russia and Japan. The first Miss Bumbum World is also due to take place in Moscow next May, where the planet’s sexiest bottom will be crowned. Explaining why Miss Bumbum has come to an end in Brazil, Cacau said: “Miss Bumbum has become Brazil’s biggest beauty competition, and one of the most famous in the world. “Only the Rio carnival gets more media coverage, and our winners have gone on to become household names, ambassadors of the Brazilian bottom around the world. “But all good things come to an end. We are now allowing anyone from around the world to compete for the title of the planet’s sexiest bottom in Miss Bumbum World.We’re excited about finding the world’s best bottom.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth whopping 12lb","story":"NewsMum gives birth to whopping lb oz baby boy - with NO pain reliefThe -year-old wasnt bothered by her tots teeming weight and said all child birth is painfulShareCommentsByHayley CoyleAmber Hicks:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsNikki Bell with baby Parker \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA newborn weighing a whopping lb oz has left doctors at a hospital in Australia stunned - and set a new record.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August. Buses will continue to operate for the services that haven’t been reintroduced, and for services between Ayr and Girvan. The existing timetable for services between Ayr and Glasgow Central remains in place. Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: “We know it has been a challenging time for our customers, so we are pleased to be able to restore some services between Ayr and Stranraer. “We are working flat out with South Ayrshire Council and our task force partners to get all services to and from Ayr back to normal as soon as possible.” Bill Reeve, chair of Ayr Station Task Force, added: “Theof rail passenger services between Stranraer and Ayr is a welcome step towards resolving this issue. “While we remain mindful there is still work to be done to restore the complete service it is good that hard work by both South Ayrshire Council and the ScotRail Alliance has now made this first step possible. “The Task Force partners continue to work together to ensure we can bring back a full timetable as quickly as possible and we thank businesses, commuters and the local community for their continued patience while we do.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"council chiefs apologise after sports","story":"NewsCouncil chiefs apologise after sports facility was dug up without warningResidents in Murkirk were left frustrated and helpless as their only sports facility was taken away due to wear and tear.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV News \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil chiefs have apologised after AstroTurf was dug up without warning.

He said: “Muirkirk articial AstroTurf was ripped up supposedly in the name of health and safety. “This is wrong, the park was in excellent condition. “It was that good, the mothers would meet up during the day with their young children in the park, shut gate and let them play knowing they were safe and there was nothing on the playing surface. It is well looked after by all its users. “After that primary school children would play football, then secondary kids would play football. After that, the adults would play.

versatile Anne played Rosemary by Frank Bridge on piano next-quite beautully-this surely must have been a piece about the love of his le.Dick then brought out the bass clarinet and introduced his own compositions - Pontefiore and Tarantella.Pontefiore was composed for a stage production set in the South of Italy in which a Private Angelo finds a little peace amongst the conflict of war.Tarantella

Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that!

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from pound to pound, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with pound. billion expected to be lost on these machines between May , when the reduction was agreed, and October , when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, ldquoa signicant amount of the total will be lost ldquoin our most deprived areas.It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as  issuing a report that found that ldquodisadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgowrsquos Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that ldquoavailability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling.Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in , the so-called fixed-odds betting terminalsMs Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reithrsquos report was issued. In the years since, though, they have come to represent all that is wrong with the gambling industry, not least because they enable customers to place pound bets every  seconds, leading some to lose thousands in a single sitting.In Scotland, which, according to Gambling Commission figures, not only has more gamblers as a proportion of the population than Britain as a whole but more problem gamblers too, FOBTs are seen as such an issue that the Scottish Government - which cannot set gambling legislation - was given special powers under the  Scotland Act to limit their prevalence. Yet while Holyrood has been able to cap the number of machines installed in new betting shops for the past two years it has not yet taken action to do so, preferring instead to wait for the UK Government to show its hand on maximum stakes first - a decision that is looking less sound in light of the Westminster delay.Given this proleration of issues it is no wonder that Ms Crouch has been so roundly praised for taking a stand on the delay to implementing reduced FOBT stakes, with commentators from across the political spectrum highlighting not just the passion and courage that led her to make the move but her principles and morals too. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, took to Twitter to praise her ldquocommitment to doing right.Yet as Ms Crouchrsquos parliamentary voting record makes clear, this is not a politician who usually cares so deeply about doing what is right for those living in deprivation, but rather someone who is usually happy to toe the Nasty Party line. Indeed, according to parliamentary monitoring website They Work For You, while Ms Crouch has consistently voted in favour of tax breaks for higher-rate taxpayers and against taxing bankersrsquo bonuses, she has also been consistent in her opposition to using public money to create jobs for young people in long-term unemployment and in her support of reducing welfare spending and restricting the scope of legal aid. She has even voted against giving local authorities the power to regulate the use of FOBTs and opposed a plan that would have required online bookies to automatically ban any problem gambler who had registered for self-exclusion.Put in that context the motivation behind Ms Crouchrsquos resignation is harder to fathom, particularly as her parliamentary colleagues have rubbished the claim that the rule change was due to come in in April anyway. One thing is clear, though: this is not a rogue Tory whose moral compass has led her to care more about social justice and deprivation prevention than her own party and career. Sure Ms Crouch is to be admired for taking a stand on problem gambling, butevery other political decision she makes is to the detriment of those whose plight she is supposedly trying to highlight, who, ultimately, stands to benefit "},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-vulcan-7-kings-edinburgh-three-stars","story":"Vulcan Kingrsquos Theatre, EdinburghNeil Cooper, Three starsAn actorrsquos le can go in many ways.

There may be a glut in the global market for Michelinrsquos small car tyres, and diesel and petrol cars are being phased out. But we are not going to see the end of transportation, which is the basis of civilisation itself. Whatever you look at ndash electric, hydrogen, compressed air ndash the vehicles of the future are going to need tyres.And increasingly they are likely to require small, high-quality tyres, with low rolling resistance, of the kind Michelin was supposed to specialise in making in Dundee. The current vogue for ever-larger cars, with bigger wheels, which we are told has killed demand for the plantrsquos tyres, cannot last. Heavy diesel SUVs will be so expensive to run in five or ten yearsrsquo time that no one in their right minds will buy them. It is anyway one of the daftest fashions of modern times.But surely, making car tyres is a noxious chemical process that pollutes the environment and leaves a massive carbon footprint  Well, not in Dundee it doesnrsquot, where much of Michelinrsquos power comes from two wind turbines. Sixty-one million pounds ndash much of it public money ndash has been spent on making this plant one of the most advanced and least polluting on the planet. The more you look at the closure of Michelin Dundee, the less it seems to make sense. This is not some rust belt relic.The Michelin plant used to provide secure employment for nearly , workers, and many more in the companies that depended on their wages. It contributed at least pound million to the local economy ndash four times the best estimate of the VArsquos impact. These were secure, well-paid jobs, not disposable seasonal tourist work. You can well understand the anger of the workforce here, which has worked closely with the French firm since it came here in .Indeed, one of the reasons Michelinrsquos closure came as such as surprise is that it has been, in many ways, a model of modern, constructive industrial relations and rarely in the news ndash unlike plants like Timex, which closed after a bitter strike in . The Michelin union leaders are talking about ldquobetrayal by the company, not least because the news was leaked to the press before the workforce got to hear of it, and before Christmas too. Why, they ask, has this happened only three years after the Dundee plant was reconfigured precisely so that it could make a larger range of bigger tyres Well, the biggest and most obvious change is Brexit. That has been the black swan event that no one in large-scale manufacturing in the UK considered a possibility until . And only very recently has the prospect of a no-deal Brexit become a reality. This is a French firm, after all, and you might expect it to be worried about the prospect of .m tyres having special export certicates and tarfs when they cross new borders to the European single market.However, the company insists that its decision to close Dundee has nothing to do with Britainrsquos decision to leave the European Union. There is no particular reason to disbelieve it. Indeed, it might well have suited the pro-European French President, Emanuel Macron, to declare that Brexit is such a disaster on wheels that even tyre manufacturers are fleeing the UK.So, wersquore left with the firmrsquos main claim that cheap tyres from Asia are being dumped here, and making even modern car tyre manufacturing uneconomic. That has nothing directly to do with Brexit, but it does relate to it. It underlines the kind of economic environment into which Britain is headed, post-Brexit. Increasingly, workers in the UK will be competing with workers in developing countries where wages are often nugatory.The ldquoGlobal Britain project is all about thrusting Britain into this low-cost, low-regulation market, a kind of Hong Kong of Europe, where we produce cheap goods to flood the EU. At least thatrsquos the theory of the Tory Brexiters. A more likely scenario is cheap goods, like tyres, flooding into Britain destroying what is left of our manufacturing base. Britain may be a post-industrial economy, but that doesnrsquot mean that making things is unimportant. Brexit is isolating the UK from EU supply chains and hastening deindustrialisation.Should the Scottish Government intervene  Well, its powers are extremely limited, not least by EU regulations on supporting loss-making industries. A lot of public money, around poundm, has already gone into the plant. It doesnrsquot seem plausible that it could be nationalised, because it is an integral part of a global company, the second-largest tyre manufacturer on the planet, and would lack the global retail networks to sell the tyres evenit could make them cheaply enough.Some might suspect that Michelin had known all along that its plant was doomed and was just using what public money it could access to run the plant down while extracting what profits it could. But that would be ungenerous. Michelin has a reputation for being a relatively responsible company, and anyway it invested a great deal of its own cash in the Dundee plant. Unfortunately, it was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.But these are not jobs that Britain can lose with equanimity.

More often than not those tenets are defined by race, ethnicity or religion and embrace the violent suppression of internal opponents and exclusion of outsiders iniably perceived as enemies. This is the credo of the far-right international.Social Liberal Partys Jair Bolsonaro ldquoLetrsquos go straight to the dictatorship, replied Jair Bolsonaro back in  when asked in an interview whether he would shut down Congresshe were to become president of Brazil.Today, of course, Mr Bolsonaro is president-elect of Brazil and scheduled to take office in January next year after an election campaign characterised by all the hallmarks of authoritarianism.Mr Bolsonarorsquos campaign drew from a now all-too-familiar political playbook, placing at its heart a xenophobic vision of Brazilian society.Read more:Britains rightist parties die as their ideology goes mainstreamFrom a staunch defence of Brazilrsquos decadesrsquo long brutal military dictatorship to threatening to shoot opponents and vowing to pack the countryrsquos supreme court with sympathisers, there is a discomfiting familiarity about Mr Bolsonarorsquos rhetoric. It doesnrsquot take a great leap of imagination to see the parallels with Donald Trumprsquos vision of America. Mr Bolsonarorsquos election is only the latest chapter in a global resurgence of authoritarianism that in less than a decade has seen the extreme right move from being outside the corridors of power to the centre of power itself.During those years, pushed by the election of Mr Trump and political changes in Europe, there has been a breaking down of the taboo that kept far-right political ideas largely outside mainstream political culture.Election of President Trump has pushed far-right ideology into mainstream Explaining this sudden resurgent rise of the authoritarian right, Walden Bello of the US-based think-tank Foreign Policy in Focuspoints to what he says is the extreme rightrsquos expropriation of the anti-globalisation critique from progressives.In a recent article for FPIF entitled ldquoSieg Heil Deacutejagrave vu  he argues that theldquoextreme right has now married these traditionally left-wing concerns to a vicious racist, chauvinistic, and anti-immigrant agenda that is reminiscent of the  that the fascists and Nazis offered to people during the volatile s.He describes this agenda as a defensive programme that involves strong state management of the economy, while leaving the capitalist mode of production largely intact with its class inequalities.Mr Bello insists though that this same programme comes with discriminatory privileges for whole communities based on ethnicity, blood and race, and with borders sealed to migrants.ldquoCall it a welfare state, but only for members of the dominant racial and cultural group, he says.Read more:Far-right referrals to Scots terror scheme doubleWhile Brazil is the latest country to have a far-right party and demagogue succeed in gaining power at a national level, this disturbing trend has manest itself globally.Across the world today there is so much reminiscent of the s, when forces of the extreme right were also on the offensive and the fate of progressive democratic politics hung in the balance.ldquoThe world is fracturinghellip Europe is leaning almost everywhere towards the extremes and towards nationalism. Those who donrsquot see what is happening everywhere around us are implicitly deciding to be the sleepwalkers of todayrsquos world, French president Emmanuel Macron warned darkly in a recent television address.In Europe far-right populist parties have seen a surge resulting in parliamentary gains in  of the  EU member countries over the past two election cycles, according to the Centre for American Progress a progressive public policy and advocacy organisation.In Europe these parties and their leaders made the most signicant gains in Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Estonia, winning five per cent more in the share of votes. Some leaders like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have already demonstrated a willingness to roll back democratic norms and quash political opposition in order to entrench their authority.Further afield itrsquos much the same story. Since the massive  election win of Narendra Modi and his ultra-right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata PartyIndiarsquos pretensions of being the largest democracy in the world have crumbled.Recently, the BJP has mounted an all-out vicious attack on left-oriented activists, writers, and intellectuals in the country, which some describe as reminiscent of McCarthyism in the US during the s and s.This has been accompanied by atrocities meted out to Muslims, Dalits, and indigenous peoples or Aasis who make up .% of Indiarsquos population.Elsewhere in Asia, President Rodrigo Dutertersquos scrapping of the liberal democratic constitution and instituting an authoritarian system masquerading as federalism in the Philippines has left thousands dead.In the streets of the eastern German town of Chemnitz, neo-Nazis march, innocent foreigners have been hunted down and attacked, while racist slogans have been chanted amid illegal Hitler salutes.As I write, Americans go to the polls in mid-term elections the results of which could further polarise a country that has seen its own violent Unite the Right rallies in towns like Charlottesville.As Nic Robertson of CNN ominously observed recently: ldquoThe world order we are seeing now is one fixing for a fight.

In Magdarsquos case it takes an intervention from social worker Jackie to open the door to a new-ish kind of le. This involves a reunion with Magdarsquos estranged daughter Chrissie, and above all a casting out of the figure of her dead mother, an opera singer who was killed in the Balkan war.All of this is woven into a handsome looking and heart-felt production by Muriel Romanes for her and Dowrsquos new Sylvian Productions company. At its centre is a moving central performance from Carol Ann Crawford as Magda, who is given ample support by Romana Abercrombie as Chrissie, Pauline Lockhart as Jackie and a fine-voiced Rosemary Nairne as Magdarsquos lost mother.There is magic here too by way of an ingenious set of boxes designed by John and Jeanine Byrne, which house beautully constructed miniatures of the clutter packing Magdarsquos mind. A baby grand piano, a war-scarred landscape and scattered chairs are all in the mix.Despite such care and attention to details like this, at the moment it feels like Magdarsquos transformation happens so rapidly that Dowrsquos play is more of a well-drawn sketch of a show in need of going much deeper below the surface.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAlistair Carmichael, MP for Orkney and Shetland, has called on Treasury Ministers to work across Government to help invest in the wave and tidal industry to push it to the point of full commercialisation.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Wednesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If you live in the east of Scotland, it is the obvious place to go in order to fly to all sorts of destinations. In fact,you want to fly, you have to go to an airport – an observation so obvious that it hardly needs to be made. But it is worth bearing in mind when considering the responsibilities that the people who run airports have. They have a captive market, and they have to act accordingly.Edinburgh Airport has been consistently criticised for its astonishingly expensive parking charges. Obviously the airport has to weigh considerations of encouraging the use of public transport, which is environmentally so much better, against the desire of people to use their cars. If parking were to be prohibitively expensive, then people would be forced to use buses and trams. Butyou do allow it, which they do, then it should only be charged at a rate that is considered fair and not exorbitant. Otherwise it looks like taking advantage. And we might remind ourselves here that the idend paid to the owners of Edinburgh Airport this year was considerably higher than the previous year. Edinburgh Airport, in other words, makes lots and lots of money.But with that, it has a responsibility to avoid antagonising its users too much. It can antagonise them a bit, but not too much. It should not make them wait for ages and ages in a taxi queue – which seems to happen frequently – and it should also listen to the concerns of Edinburgh’s splendid, long-suffering taxi drivers. They, as a body, seem to have their issues, and they, as a body, are always right. Taxi drivers rarely present a finely nuanced view of the world as they see it.: Letters: Greedy Edinburgh Airport drop-off price hike is outrageousBut we should not spend too much time criticising the equally splendid body of people who run Edinburgh Airport. This is a well-managed airport and they obviously run it very efficiently, evenpeople tend to moan a little bit . It is not easy to run an airport, particularly when the airport has also become a large shopping centre, or, more accurately, an eastern souk. It is quite a business combining the job of running a grand souk and a place where people are able to catch a flight and find enough seats to sit down while they wait for their flight.One solution, of course, would be to charge people to sit down at the airport. This is not currently done, but I feel that it will not be long before that commercial opportunity is recognised and acted upon. These charges should be moderate – say, one pound for ten minutes, rising to five pounds payable by those who clearly have come to the airport with the intention of sitting around for a long time. These people should be discouraged from sitting on private seats and redirected to public benches outside. I have also noticed that the airport currently does not charge for the use of its toilets. This is something that must have escaped their notice and should be acted upon. Making the charge realistically high – say two pounds per visit – would discourage people from using the facilities, or even reading in the loo.: Edinburgh Airport passenger numbers break . million barrierBut lest this sounds like a series of complaints, I would like to make some positive suggestions for the airport, in its undoubted wisdom, to consider. The first of these is for a fast track facility to allow passengers who do not wish to follow a deliberately winding and circuitous path through their fantoosh duty free shop. This would enable you to get from security to gate without being forced to endure the efforts of salespeople to get one to sample whisky, buy sunglasses, or try perfumes. People can tell when they are the victims of intense sales pressure, you know. And some people, mirabile dictu, like to walk straight, rather than wander through a shop.As far as drop-off charges are concerned, it is about time that the airport recognised public resentment over these and introduced a new, conciliatory system whereby those who drop people off from their car are not charged, as long as they don’t stop the car. This would mean that drivers could slow down while their passengers leaped out of the car, tossing their suitcases ahead of them. Wardens could be on hand to impose charges on those who did not maintain sufficient speed in that manoeuvre.And finally, in this constructive spirit, how about introducing an emotional baggage desk in the departure hall  Many of us travel with excessive emotional baggage, and it would be a great innovationwe could declare this at the airport before the flight. This would mean that you would drop off your physical baggage at check-in, and then move on to declare your emotional baggage to an understanding and sympathetic agent at another desk. Things like unresolved issues. Doubts. Unfulfilled desires. There’s so much to talk about at airports.Use of the emotional baggage counter could attract a small charge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825485.1541531951!/image/image.jpg","title":"join the british army foreign nationals should read this first","story":"Foreign nationals being urged to join the UK armed forces might wish to askit is is worth it, writes Martyn McLaughlin.In many ways, the news that Britain’s armed forces are to signicantly step up their recruitment drive among Commonwealth nations feels like the quintessential Brexit story.It knits together the narratives of a country wrestling with its imperial past, while stumbling and blinking its way towards an uncertain future, one where new threats must be mitigated by old alliances. At its heart, lie perpetually confounding questions of Britishness and belonging.The Ministry of Defence announcement, signalling an end to the five-year residency requirement for Commonwealth citizens looking to join the armed services, almost read like a celebration. It hailed the military’s “long-held links” with the Commonwealth and noted how its people have “bravely served in a iety of roles”. This proud legacy, said Mark Lancaster, the armed forces minister, would be seized upon, bringing “key skills” and “dedicated service”. He added: “Their dferent perspectives will also help us to enhance our cultural understanding, giving us an operational advantage over our adversaries.”It is hard to decide which subtext is the most absurd, but let us begin with the notion that Britain’s armed services are bastions of ersity and inclusion. This is a force where women account for just one in every ten regular forces personnel, and until last month, were ineligible to apply for swaths of roles. It is a force where black, asian and minority ethnic representation sits at . per cent. No less laughable is the idea that new Commonwealth recruits will be a bonus to Britain’s military might. Be under no illusions, this measure is explicitly designed to plug a gap of , soldiers, sailors and air personnel – the largest such shortfall in eight years. In the form of the Commonwealth, the UK Government – which has shown no shame over how it betrayed the contribution of the Windrush generation, veterans among them – has found a way to insult a new cohort under the guise of offering a gilded opportunity. : UK armed forces to allow foreign nationals to joinIt is farcical that he service of these men and women is not deemed a sufficient sacrice to earn them automatic UK citizenship, but then, there has always been an awkward, conflicting duality to the identity of the ranks of Britain’s Commonwealth personnel. On the one hand, they enjoy the heroic status afforded to all those prepared to kill – and die – for the realm on the other, they remain ‘others’, a migrant force who serve with, but not in, our forces.The earliest ranks of Fijians and Jamaicans, unable to apply for UK citizenship even after serving for more than five years, learned the hard way. The reason given was a risible as it was cruel – time served in German and Cypriot outposts nulled continuous residency. It took until  before the Home Office changed the rules.Until , a child born to foreign nationals in the armed services during an overseas posting was not automatically eligible to become a UK citizen, an appalling oversight which meant the siblings in some families had dferent nationalities. It is easy to characterise these incidents as anomalies, but the history of our Commonwealth service personnel is one of institutionalised disadvantage. You hear it still in the idle, ignorant chatter of ‘foreign legions’ and ‘mercenaries’, but it is built into the system too.The cumulative impact of immigration issues, visas, travel and cultural dferences leaves many Commonwealth recruits feeling subordinate, asked to shoulder every risk infor few of the rewards.Studies into this Commonwealth military contingent are thin on the ground, but their findings are striking. A  London School of Economics report found they were often passed over for promotion or not drafted into roles they applied for due to racial prejudice and a lack of assimilation.: Almost , Scottish MoD jobs have goneIn March, meanwhile, Anglia Ruskin University researchers found that the most problematic issue facing the Commonwealth armed forces community was being able to remain in the UK because of costly visas and complex immigration rules. As one respondent put it, “all aspects of le unravel” when faced with the byzantine immigration system. The cost of settlement for an inidual service member from the Commonwealth is £,. Should they wish to bring a partner and two children, the sum spirals to an eyewatering £,. Indeed, figures from the Army Families Federation show visa costs increased by  per cent between  and , whilst the cost of family members remaining permanently in the UK rose by  per cent for adults and an astonishing , per cent for children over the same period.As things stand, a Commonwealth Army private on basic pay does not meet the minimum immigration income threshold of £, to bring a spouse and child to the UK.Quite how the UK Government can allow this to continue, while hoping to recruit an additional , people from the Commonwealth each year, speaks either to its ignorance or its disdain. Two of the central tenets of the armed forces covenant stipulate that no one should be disadvantaged by their service, and that in some cases, special treatment might be appropriate. If we are so intent on fostering closer links between our military and the Commonwealth, how can we continue to turn a blind eye to the problems faced by those who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrice ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825563.1541579225!/image/image.jpg","title":"us midterms american voters send record number of women to congress","story":"A record number of women have been elected to the US house of representatives, nearly two years after women took to the streets across America in protest over the inauguration of President Donald Trump.The incoming class of legislators could have a stark impact on politics in the nation’s capital, particularly within the Democratic Party, after a midterm election that was widely seen as a referendum on Mr Trump’s first term.Voters are on track to send at least  women to the house, surpassing the previous record of . According to data compiled by The Associated Press,  women ran for the house as major-party candidates this year.Among the new representatives headed to the house is Jenner Wexton, a Virginia state senator who defeated incumbent Barbara Comstock in one of the most closely-watched races across the country.And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the former Bernie Sanders organiser who won a shock primary victory over a senior house Democrat, will also head to congress.: US Midterms: Democrats on course to take House control as Republicans retain SenateThe election day gains by women capped a midterm election which has been defined by the energy of women, both on the political left and right.Women not only ran for office at an unprecedented rate, with several defeating white, male incumbents during their party primaries. They mobilised on the grassroots level, and played larger roles as donors than in previous election cycles.There was also a historic gender gap that showed women more supportive of Democrats than Republicans. According to VoteCast, women voted considerably more in favour of their congressional Democratic candidate. About six in  voted for the Democrat, compared with four in  for the Republican. Men, by contrast, were more evenly ided in their vote.In victory speeches across the country, women acknowledged it has been a ground-breaking year.Ayanna Pressley, who became the first black woman elected to US congress from Massachusetts, said: “I am so honoured to share both the ballot and the stage with the many visionary, bold women who have raised their hand to run for public office.“Now, listen, I know for a fact none of us ran to make history - we ran to make change. However, the historical signicance of this evening is not lost on me. The signicance of history is not lost on me, including my personal one.”Former health and human services secretary Donna Shalala acknowledged that both of her opponents in the race for a house seat from Florida were women.She said: “This is the year of the woman, and the fact that women were willing to put themselves on the line is important, whether they’ve been Republicans or Democrats.”This year, women not only increased their numbers in congress, but the new class of representatives includes women from a wide patchwork of backgrounds, adding to a legislature that is expected to be more erse.“This isn’t just the year of the woman, this is the year of every woman,” said Cecile Richards, who served as the president of Planned Parenthood for more than a decade, noting the ground-breaking ersity among the women who have run for office this year.Texas is set to send its first Hispanic women to congress, as Democrats Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia both won their races. In Kansas, Sharice Davids, a Democrat running in a suburban Kansas City district, will become one of the first Native American women elected to congress, and the first openly LGBT person to represent Kansas at the federal level.Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the Democrats who is considering a shot at the  presidential race, said that the two years since Mr Trump ascended to the White House had ushered a new generation of women into public le.“Women who had never run for anything stepped up to put their names on the ballot,” she said.“They ignored the party bosses who said they should wait their turn.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh.

He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone . We don’t want to set them on a pedestal above other groups.”Earlier this year, an Irish language event hosted by then DUP Mayor of Mid and East Antrim was commended by Irish language groups.Police linking town incidents and appeal for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8692154.1541176569!/image/image.jpg","title":"mid and east antrim residents asked for views on outdoor recreation","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is calling on residents to have their say on an outdoor recreation strategy for the area.The council wants as much response as possible from clubs, groups, and lovers of the great outdoors to take part in a public consultation as they draw up proposals that will see which natural assets can be used for the benefit of residents and attract visitors to our borough.With coastline, rivers, uplands and low lands, forests, parks and open spaces, Mid and East Antirm has some of the most fantastic natural assets just waiting to be developed.To get involved, come along to one of three public consultation events, which are being led by Outdoor Recreation NI.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

own Cabinet and her Democratic Unionist Party allies to show the full legal advice behind her Brexit plans..pushThe Cabinet is on stand-by for fresh talks to agree a Brexit deal amid claims by Tory Leavers that the Prime Minister has already reached an agreement, while Mrs May will update European Council president Donald Tusk on the latest developments.Phone call with PM @theresa_may this morning to take stock of progress in #brexit talks and discuss way ahead.— Donald TuskNovember , But Brexiteers, including Environment Secretary Michael Gove, want to see the full legal advice setting out how any customs arrangement to avoid a hard Irish border could be ended to avoid it becoming a permanent settlement.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, chief whip for Mrs May’s DUP allies, called for the advice to be published, as did shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sir Jeffrey Donaldson called for the Government’s legal advice on the Brexit proposals to be published The calls came as the Prime Minister set up five new  to advise on adapting to the post-Brexit business world.Leading figures including BT Group chairman Jan du Plessis and ITV boss Carolyn McCall will co-chair the telectoms, creative, technology and media business council.Sir Roger Carr, of BAE Systems, and Rolls-Royce chairman Ian Davis will co-chair the industrial, infrastructure and manufacturing council and other senior figures will also chair business councils for the small business, financial and retail sectors.Speculation that a Brexit deal is close was fuelled by leaked documents apparently setting out how the Prime Minister would sell an exit package to the public.Downing Street distanced itself from the blueprint reported by the BBC but the document heightened suspicion among Tory Brexiteers that a deal has secretly been secured.Mrs May’s plan would see the whole UK effectively agree to remain in the customs union to help avoid a hard border with Ireland as a “backstop”no other arrangement can be found.Mr Gove wants to see the full legal advice setting out how an exit from the backstop can be found to make sure the UK is not permanently kept within a customs union which would severely curtail its ability to strike free trade deals with nations around the world – a key prize for Brexiteers.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Environment Secretary Michael Gove wants to see the full legal advice on the Government’s plan With Mrs May relying on the  DUP MPs for a Commons majority, Sir Jeffrey’s demand that the legal advice be published – something not normally done by governments – poses a fresh headache for the Prime Minister.Sir Jeffrey told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “I think it’s in the public interest we understand fully what’s happening here.“It’s because it affects the whole UK, therefore it shouldn’t just be the DUP that sees this advice, or the Government.“If the House of Commons is going to have a meaningful vote on a deal that includes, and upon which this legal advice is very, very important, then I think people are entitled to know what that advice is.”Labour’s Sir Keir, meanwhile, was due in Brussels to warn of the dangers of Britain and the European Union striking a loose agreement on future relations.The shadow Brexit secretary told Today: “It is not the duty of the Opposition to back the Prime Minister come what may.“What we can’t be expected to do now, with a gun to our head, is to back the Prime Minister whatever she brings back, however good or bad and without any detail.“That is not opposition – that is surrender.”He added that it was “essential MPs are given the opportunity to scrutinise the Attorney General’s legal advice before voting on the final deal”.“The public have the right to know precisely what the Cabinet has signed up to and what the implications are for the future.”Mrs May told senior ministers on Tuesday that she would not agree a withdrawal deal with the EU “at any cost”.The PM assured her top team that there would be another Cabinet before any agreement is settled.No extra meeting has yet been scheduled ahead of the regular weekly gathering next Tuesday.According to the leaked planning document, Mrs May will give a “we have delivered on the referendum” speech to the CBI conference on November .The “grid” document said MPs would be told to put personal interests aside to back an agreement on November .Former Brexit minister Steve Baker told the Daily : “It looks like exactly the kind of back-of-the-envelope post-exit plan to sell a rubbish deal I would have expected.“For months we have expected an orchestrated campaign following a fabricated row over the backstop.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics, told the newspaper: “There are rumours a deal has been done without keeping the Cabinet properly informed … the Chequers proposals undermined trust.“If there is an attempt to soften up and hoodwink people there will be no trust left.”But Number  said the “childish language” and misspelling in the notes, which includes the incorrect spelling of the Irish prime minister’s name, should make it clear it “doesn’t represent the Government’s thinking”."},{"url":null,"title":"george bests shirt part of unique celebration of manchester united icons life","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  |

Editors Viewpoint: Charity to score with Best shirt from legendary game The following morning he famously visited the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast to present the shirt to a young patient John Doherty, whose mum had written to the late Belfastsports editor Malcolm Brodie askingit would be possible to secure Georges autograph for John as he was too unwell to go to the game to see his idol in the flesh.When asked, George said he would do better than that and turned up at the hospital in person to surprise a then wide-eyed -year-old John with the shirt.In the intervening years John has taken his prized possession out of his Glengormley home only twice, for a UTV Kelly Show special where he was reunited with George, and for an episode of the BBC Antiques Roadshow, never broadcast, but which valued the shirt at £,.Now John, who regards it as priceless and who says he would never sell, is allowing the shirt to go on open display for the first time at an exhibition of George Best memorabilia this weekend to raise money for the NI Children to Lapland Christmas appeal \"because it is for such a good cause\".The exhibition is at the Windrose bar restaurant in Carrickfergus marina during a Man United themed day around Sundays Manchester derby with Georges former Northern Ireland and Old Trafford team-mate Sammy McIlroy in attendance.It features many never before seen items like shirts, medals, fashion originals, handwritten letters and personal belongings like a cine camera and transistor radio, with accompanying photographs for authenticity.But pride of place will go to that shirt, and as he posed for anotherpicture yesterday,  years on from he first featured on our pages, John, now  and a retired primary school teacher, recalled the  Sunday morning when George arrived at the Royal at the height of his fame to the amazement of an adoring childrens ward.\"It was a total surprise to me,\" John said.\"I was being treated for asthma and couldnt go to the game.\"My mum knew I idolised George and wrote to theasking Malcolm Brodiehe could get me an autograph.\"John learned later that when Malcolm mentioned the request to George, the star asked to be collected at his parents Cregagh estate home the following morning so he could visit the hospital in person.\"He came in carrying a brown paper parcel which he said contained sweets. I was in awe, like the whole of the childrens ward who gathered around. He chatted to us and then, as he was leaving, handed me the parcel, telling me not to open it until he was gone.\"Unbeknownst to me, he was hiding behind a screen, waiting to see my reaction. I was amazed and overjoyed when I saw it was the shirt he had worn against Scotland the previous day and then George came back in to pose for aphotograph I treasure to this day.\"It was a fantastic experience for a football and Man United mad boy and an incredible gesture by George, which I was later to discover was typical of him.\"John has kept the shirt securely under wraps at his Glengormley home for the last five decades, bringing it out only briefly for those TV appearances.Now he has finally been persuaded to loan the shirt for a first public viewing by Georges fans since that  game.Windrose owner Gary Callaghan, a United season ticket holder and Best devotee, believes interest in the collection reflects the still massive fascination with the football hero who died in , aged just .Gary said: \"We are indebted to John for allowing us to display such an iconic shirt, not seen in public since that historic game.\"We know how much it means to him. Likewise the personal items loaned to us by Georges sister Barbara McNarry and her husband Norman, the renowned collector of United memorabilia Ray Adler, and the authors of the book, George Best: A Celebration, Bernie Smith and Maureen Hunt.\"Oscar winning producer Stephen Evans is also flying in from London. He is making a film about George, similar to his acclaimed one on Seve Ballesteros.\"This is an exhibition with a dference in that it personalises George and tells his story. Exhibits will include handwritten letters home to his family when he was a Man United apprentice, his school reports and driving licence.\"Some never seen before trophies, medals, photographs, match-worn football shirts and fashion items will also be on display, including a shirt made by the famous designer Paul Smith when he was just starting out.\"Barbara McNarry, who has endorsed the exhibition of her legend brothers personal belongings, said: \"We are so excited. There have been many exhibitions about George the footballer but this one will allow his fans to learn about George the man.\"The event includes a themed lunch based on The Best family sausages as famously advertised by George on TV for Cookstown in the Seventies, viewing of the Manchester derby, and a question and answer session by Sammy McIlroy with UTVs Ruth Gorman.Tickets, £  £, are available from the Windrose "},{"url":null,"title":"homes evacuated in belfast security alert after suspicious object found","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

help those just above the threshold who are now missing out on music tuition due to cost.“I know a lot of my friends have now dropped out of music just because they can’t afford it, which is ridiculous,” she said.“By introducing a charge for instrumental service, you are denying young people this opportunity depending on how much money they have, which just shouldn’t be the case.“And in

health improves, you end up with more friendsyou join a band or an orchestra, even grades can improve … it seems like quite a clear solution to keep music free for everyone.”Ms Mackie said without being given the opportunity to learn violin from primary school she would not have been able to sit senior secondary school exams in music.“Without learning to play an instrument, who knows what potential talent we might be missing out on  We could have the next Bach, the next Nicola Benedetti, the next anyone in our schools,” she added.“It’s completely imperative that you’ve got to have

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Earlier this year, legislation was passed at Westminster to allow donations and loans of more than £, to parties in NI to be revealed for the first time. However, the law only covers donations made to parties from July  onwards, meaning the CRC money to the DUP is exempt.The CRC is a little known group of pro-union business people chaired by former Scottish Conservatives chairman Richard Cook.However, it appeared that the group had not been the original source of the money to the DUP. Mr Cook and the DUP have always said that the donation met every legal requirement.In evidence to the Commons’ Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday, the Electoral Commission’s CEO Louise Edwards said the body had received quarterly reports from the DUP about the donations they were given.She told MPs: “If we discover a donation in one of those reports is impermissible then the restrictions are lted and we can talk about that donation.“We cannot talk about donations to the DUP from that period and the reason for that is because having veried those reports the donors on them were permissible.”SNP MP Brendan O’Hara pressed the Commission on the issue, askingit had done everything it could to check the money which went to the DUP was “not of foreign origin” and was permissible under UK law.The Commission’s head of regulations, Claire Bassett replied: “We were satisfied that the donors were permissible”.Heavy rain causing dficult driving conditions for commuters Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But she also spoke of her “frustration” that the body is not permitted to publish the identities of donors to NI parties prior to July , adding: “We are restricted by law in what we can say. It is as frustrating for us as it is you.”Ms Edwards also spoke of the “lack of transparency” surrounding political donations in NI during that period, a situation which Mr O’Hara branded “intolerable”.He also enquired about allegations contained in a recent BBC NI Spotlight programme regarding whether there was a common plan between the DUP and the EU referendum campaign group, Vote Leave.Ms Edwards said the Commission had determined there was insufficient evidence to warrant an investigation.try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required.

Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Trump tweeted.History was working against the president in both the House and the Senate.The presidentrsquos party has traditionally suffered deep losses in his first midterm election, and  was the only midterm election in the past three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats.Democratsrsquo dreams of the Senate majority, always unlikely, were shattered after losses in top Senate battlegrounds: Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, North Dakota and Texas.Senator Ted Cruz delivers a victory speech In Texas, Senator Ted Cruz staved off a tough challenge from Democrat Beto OrsquoRourke, whose record-smashing fundraising and celebrity have set off buzz he could be a credible  White House contender.Mr Trump encouraged voters to view the  midterms as a referendum on his leadership, pointing proudly to the surging economy at his recent rallies.Republican Florida governor-elect Ron DeSantis celebrates victory Nearly % of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to AP VoteCast, the national survey of the electorate, while one in four said they voted to express support for Mr Trump.Overall, six in  voters said the country was headed in the wrong direction, but roughly that same number described the national economy as excellent or good.Twenty-five percent described health care and immigration as the most important issues in the election.Nearly two-thirds said Mr Trump was a reason for their vote.The president bet big on a xenophobic closing message, warning of an immigrant ldquoinvasion that promised to spread violent crime and drugs across the nation.Several television networks, including the presidentrsquos favourite Fox News Channel, yanked a Trump campaign advertisement off the air on the eve of the election, determining that its portrayal of a murderous immigrant went too far.One of Mr Trumprsquos most vocal defenders on immigration, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, lost his bid for governor.Mr Kobach had built a national profile as an advocate of tough immigration policies and strict voter photo ID laws.ldquoAnd letrsquos make sure nobody re-writes history: This resistance began with women and itrsquos being led by women tonight. https:t.co Nlzgibzmdash Elizabeth WarrenNovember , He served as vice chairman of Mr Trumprsquos now-defunct commission on voter fraud.The president found partial success despite his current job approval, set at % by Gallup, the lowest at this point of any first-term president in the modern era.Both Barack Obamarsquos and Bill Clintonrsquos numbers were five points higher, and both suffered major midterm losses of  and  House seats respectively.Bernie Sanders was re-elected Meanwhile, the close of the  midterm season marked the unofficial opening of the next presidential contest.Several ambitious Democrats easily won re-election, including presidential prospects Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.A handful of others played key roles in their partiesrsquo midterm campaigns, though not as candidates, and were reluctant to telegraph their  intentions before the  fight was decided.They included New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, Calornia Senator Kamala Harris, former New York City mayor Tom Steyer and former vice president Joe Biden.Ms Warren said: ldquoThis resistance began with women and it is being led by women tonight..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Democrats take control of US House but  ublue wave u does not reach Senate article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in .

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
