God, it\u0027s gotten good,\u0027 he added.\u0027But it hasn\u0027t. Things have changed, things have improved, and then things have gotten worse. \u0027Progress doesn\u0027t go like that (up). It goes like this (up and down) and there are downturns and we\u0027re in one and that\u0027s why I think Green Book is an important movie to remind us that we are all the same people.\u0027No matter how far we seem to be, all you have to do is talk to each other and there\u0027s a common ground in there and there\u0027s a way to unite.\u0027  The 62-year-old director - famed for comedy hits like Dumb And Dumber and There\u0027s Something About Mary - said he feels cable news is not doing much to help the current ide in the country. \u0027Unfortunately, people aren\u0027t talking. People are watching Fox News and they\u0027re watching MSNBC and that\u0027s not a discussion that\u0027s being talked to,\u0027 he said.\u0027But what we\u0027ve got to do is talk to each other the way people always did in the past.\u0027          The film starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortnensen, tells the story of world-class pianist \u0027Doc\u0027 Don Shirely (Ali) as he is protected by Italian-American bodyguard Tony Lip (Mortensen) on a tour of the deep South during segregation in the 1960s.          Mahershala Ali nabbed the award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his part in Green Book And despite the wave of anti-Trump bashing in Hollywood, Farrelly admitted that sentiment is not reflective of the industry - insisting Tinsel Town isn\u0027t all left-winged.He urged his industry compatriots and Donald Trump to reach middle ground in the future saying: \u0027Let\u0027s work it out because you\u0027d be shocked at how much we have in common.\u0027Many A-list liberal stars from Robert De Niro to Meryl Streep have openly bashed President Trump for his policies, behavior and outlook.It has seen the POTUS fire back at Hollywood celebs and cause more friction.Farrelly added: \u0027We\u0027re just so ided right now. Even in the identity of Hollywood as being the liberal place, when you\u0027re in Hollywood, you know that\u0027s not all true. \u0027In fact, if you look at Ronald Reagan, he was not liberal, Clint Eastwood – not liberal, Arnold Schwarzenegger – not liberal. If you look at most action stars in fact, they\u0027re not liberal and they go on to politics. \u0027Some of the biggest stars in Hollywood aren\u0027t liberal they come from the right. So to be identified as everybody one way is just inaccurate and what it does is it helps people out there say, They\u0027re thinking one way, but they\u0027re not.\u0027I live here, I know there are both sides of the story. I just think it\u0027s easy to characterize everybody the same way from Hollywood.\u0027Well you know, I\u0027m from Rhode Island, not from Hollywood, and I came from where there are both sides and I still believe in both sides.          Farrelly (pictured on Sunday night) says he hopes \u0027that everybody sees this movie, and it\u0027s not talking to one side or the other\u0027\u0027I know there are arguments on both sides, but I believe there is something in between that you can find by just talking and I guess that\u0027s the whole point of the movie.\u0027Farrelly does hope Trump will watch Green Book, however.The film won Best Motion Picture (MusicalComedy), with writers Nick Vallelonga, Bryan Currie and Farrelly winning Best Screenplay and Mahershala Ali winning his first Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture for his role as famed pianist \u0027Doc\u0027 Don Shirley.Mahershala Ali vows to \u0027move on\u0027 from row over his Golden...\u0027Faces of change\u0027: Inclusion the big winner at the Golden...Share this articleFarrelly was also nominated for Best Director but lost out to Alfonso Curaón who directed Roma.\u0027I hope that everybody sees this movie, and it\u0027s not talking to one side or the other.

But there is nothing more we can do. The withdrawal agreement is indeed a good agreement, both for the UK and the EU. We should stick to it,\u0027 she told reporters. With the prospect of Mrs May\u0027s plan passing the Commons looking vanishingly small, opponents are pushing their own visions of how to proceed. British officials are said to be \u0027sounding out\u0027 the EU about delaying Brexit beyond March as Theresa May faces a mounting political crisis. There are claims that the UK has been \u0027putting out feelers\u0027 over the prospect of an extension to the Article 50 process.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay did not completely rule out the prospect this morning - although he insisted government policy is still to leave the EU in March.Ireland has also made clear it would not block any effort to push back the exit date. Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former education secretary Nicky Morgan have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill today designed to make it harder for the government to push ahead with no deal.The change would effectively limit the Treasury\u0027s tax-raising powers, making it more difficult to respond to the disruption from crashing out.

That is not a decision the UK Government could take, it would require the consent of all 27 member states.\u0027It would also generate some very practical issues, for example EU parliamentary elections at the end of May.\u0027He continued: \u0027The real question for Members of Parliament who voted to give the public a say through the European referendum in 2016, who voted in large numbers to trigger Article 50, (is) the consequence of triggering Article 50 is you either have a deal and the EU have been clear that the only deal on the table is the PM\u0027s deal. You either have a deal or you have no deal.\u0027 Downing Street has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a delay in the departure date, with Mrs May\u0027s official spokesman saying: \u0027The Prime Minister has been very clear on a number of occasions that extending Article 50 is not something we are intending to do.\u0027Speaking on a visit to Mali, Mr Varadkar said: \u0027We don\u0027t want to trap the UK into anything.\u0027We want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away,..

In search of photos for a history book he was working on, he went to the auction house across the street from his home and bid $380 for a box loaded with negatives.Intrigued by what he saw, Maloof was prompted to find out more about Maier, which was no easy task. He would buy and collect many of her negatives, prints, audio recordings, and 8 mm film as well as numerous personal items. Maier, who never married or had children, was a pack rat.Born on February 1, 1926 in New York, Maier spent time both in France and New York City throughout her childhood. She worked as a nanny and maid for numerous families – including talk show host Phil Donahue.Maloof interviewed the families and a complicated picture of Maier emerged. Now adults, some of the children Maier took care of said she was abusive – one woman said she hit her and shoved food down her throat. But also, ‘life was more adventurous with her around,’ one subject said.They described her as mysterious, eccentric, paradoxical, bold, and very private.‘She would have never let this happen,’ one friend said of the documentary.Indeed, in many of Maier’s self-portraits, part of or all of her is obscured, and, often, it is only her shadow.Windy City pictures that will blow you away: Stunning black...The legal battle over photos by Vivian Maier: Nanny died...Revealed: Treasure trove of amazing pictures that were kept...Share this articleShe spoke with a French accent, which one person swore was fake, and people were surprised to learn she was born in New York City. Maier sometimes used the name, ‘Smith,’ and Maloof discovered that she used many different spellings of her last name.During the documentary, Maier said in an audio recording, ‘I’m the mystery woman,’ and as she died on April 21, 2009 at aged 83 before her work received attention, she will remain so. This point was reiterated by Cortney Norman, who manages the Vivian Maier archive at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, where the images will be on display through March 2.‘In general, with the exact context of the photographs, a lot remains, you know, a mystery,’ Norman told DailyMail.com. ‘We were able to identify locations and dates for the photographs but beyond that a lot remains unknown because we don’t have Vivian with us, obviously.’Initially, Maloof introduced the black and white images to the gallery, which Norman explained were mostly from the 1950s and 1960s.‘The color work kind of picks up in the \u002760s and then moves through the end of Maier’s life,’ she said.          Maier started taking self-portraits early in the 1950s, making her one of its pioneer, according to Cortney Norman, who manages the Vivian Maier archive at the Howard Greenberg Gallery. Often, there are reflections, like the one above, and layering in the self-portraits, but there are others that are straight on and direct, she said.

This image was taken in Chicago in August 1976. Estate of Vivian Maier, Courtesy Maloof Collection and Howard Greenberg Gallery, New York          Maier used a Rolleiflex and a 35-millimeter camera, and took more than 150,000 photographic images that included prints, negatives, transparencies, and rolls of undeveloped film during her lifetime, which ned from February 1, 1926 to April 21, 2009.

There is a playfulness and humor at times in her images that are often filled with shadows, mirrors and reflections.Norman said that Maier started making self-portraits early in the 1950s, making her one of its pioneer.‘We feel that they’re very strong,’ she said. ‘You get more of a sense of her thinking and her placement in her environment.’‘Oftentimes reflection and some layering between her and, you know, of how much of herself is shown in the image, but there are others that surfaced where it’s more sort of straight on, direct.’One of the self-portraits in the series shows a clear plastic bag on the sidewalk. Inside the bag is a square piece of white paper that states ‘Here’s a real eye opener,’ and Maier’s shadow takes up the bottom right part of the image.‘That’s also another theme that carries out through her work – documenting signage or graffiti or that sort of the thing on the street that kind of adds an element of, I think, her sense of humor and commentary,’ Norman said.Maier was able to work in both black and white as well as color, and Norman said photographers are usually stronger in one area or the other.‘She definitely had a strong eye for color in the environment and placing it within the frame compositionally,’ said Norman, adding that the images in the show have not been cropped or altered.In the documentary, it is noted that many of the negatives that are developed into prints are ones that Maier had not seen herself. Maier used a Rolleiflex and a 35-millimeter camera, and had taken more than 150,000 photographic images that included prints, negatives, transparencies, and rolls of undeveloped film, according to the news release for the exhibition.‘For a large percentage, a majority of her work, it was left even undeveloped. It was more for her about the – we think anyway – about the process of shooting, the process of capturing the images, less about the sort of post-production, print process,’ Norman explained.However, there are some negatives that Maier chose to have prints made of, some of which are in the show. Existing prints made during Maier’s lifetime are quite rare, according to Norman.Maier did not approach the same subject several times, Norman said, but would ‘confidently make the image, see it all in an instant.’One of the images, for example, is a man in a grey jacket who holds an explosion of color: reds and yellows and blues and light greens of large round balloons.‘It’s just such a perfect moment that she’s able to capture both compositionally and emotionally and then just move on to her next shot,’ she said.‘That’s quite remarkable, I think.\u0027              Maier photographed many different subjects that included children, department-store mannequins, and, often, herself.

At a time when Monet was painting landscapes, Munch was depicting love and desire but also jealousy, loneliness, anxiety, grief and mental instability – most memorably in The Scream.The version being displayed at the British Museum is a black and white print, which followed a painting and two drawings of the image, but is the image that was disseminated widely during his lifetime and made him famous.Describing the timeless relevance of The Scream, the exhibition curator, Giulia Bartrum, said: “The emotional impact is incredibly important. Munch was deeply, deeply aware of mental instability, mental illness, a huge subject at the time, and that’s what he was trying to portray. Anything which tries to express the inner workings of the mind … has huge resonance today.”The Scream will be shown in the Anxiety and Separation section of the exhibition, which will also include a drawing, Despair, itself associated with Munch’s most famous work. Despair shows a figure turned away to look down into the fjords, which Bartrum said showed “perhaps the moment just before felt he heard the scream pass through nature”.In accompanying text, Munch wrote of the blood red sky, also depicted in The Scream, and how the feeling of the moment resonated around the valley and in his head.The same section also includes two versions of Angst, showing blank white faces streaming down Karl Johans Gate, Oslo’s busiest street, images Bartrum said would resonate with anyone who has felt lonely in London.The exhibition features 83 artworks in all, including 50 prints from Oslo’s Munch museum. Other themes include women, with whom Munch had a series of disastrous relationships, and sickness.Jealousy depicts the author Stanisław Przybyszewski in the foreground with a woman, presumed to be Dagny Juel, and a man with his back turned behind Przybyszewski. Juel is believed to have had a relationship with Munch before her brief marriage to Przybyszewski.The artist’s mother died from tuberculosis when he was young and his sister also succumbed to the disease. For The Sick Child, three versions of which feature in the show, Bartrum said Munch “drew out his feelings of emotion at the moment that his sister died”.She said the painting caused a scandal when it was exhibited in Berlin in 1892 because people were unused to such attempts to recreate the pain of the moment of death. The exhibition closed within a week, while at the same time proving popular with the avant-garde.The exhibition also includes matrices used to transfer ink on to paper, never before seen in the UK, and will be displayed alongside the corresponding prints.Bartrum said that for Munch, who never had children, partly because he feared they would suffer illness, his artwork served as a substitute and, unusually, he sought to collect the stones and wooden blocks, usually held by publishers.“Certainly where these matrices were concerned, he behaved as if they were his family,” she said. “He wrote anxious letters about them, always trying to track them down.”While the themes of Munch’s art resonate because of their timelessness, Bartrum, with an unsubtle nod to Brexit, said how the artist lived his life, during which he travelled to Paris and Berlin, bringing techniques and influences back to Norway, also served as an invaluable lesson in the modern age.She said: “He was a really cosmopolitan European figure and I think, in this day and age, that is an important message to convey.”Edvard Munch: Love and Angst is at the British Museum from 11 April-21 July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6efb7b124fe6fabc9495215f66b6df6d58973f29/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64930b75fea6debabeea3e785750d1a0","title":"leonardo da vinci rembrandt greatest artist of all time","story":"As the masters celebrate big anniversaries, who reaches more powerfully across the centuries – and who deserves to hit the canvas?It’s the art fight of the year, the rumble in the museum. Who is the greatest – Rembrandt van Rijn or Leonardo da Vinci? The two geniuses both have big anniversaries this year. According to the Netherlands, 2019 is officially the Year of Rembrandt. Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, the Mauritshuis in The Hague and the Museum De Lakenhall in Leiden are all putting on shows for the 350th anniversary of his death in 1669. Yet Rembrandt isn’t getting his year to himself. This also happens to be the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo in 1519. It’s a great excuse for exhibitions by Britain’s Royal Collection and British Library as well as a grand retrospective at the Louvre.So which is the bigger anniversary? The smart bet might seem to be Rembrandt. His art is so absorbing, tragic and inward. His portraits are the painterly equivalents of King Lear. He is a painter in whose shadows the soul can linger. By contrast, Leonardo is a pop star who’s still busting the market 500 years after his death – and isn’t that a bit oppressive? It’s hard not to feel alienated among all the smartphone-touting tourists in front of the Mona Lisa. Not much room there for the meditative silent communion you can have with a Rembrandt.Did Leonardo ever create anything so disarmingly and rawly human? I’d reply with another question: has anyone under the age of 30 ever given a hoot about Rembrandt? Self-portraits that probe the inner self are all very well, but there’s a universality to Leonardo that puts him in a different league. I became a fan of his genius when I was about eight. I had a Ladybird book about great artists. The story of Leonardo da Vinci was like a fairytale – there was a picture of him buying birds at market just so he could release them. What’s Rembrandt got for an eight-year-old? And how many copies would The Rembrandt Code sell?As for depth, it’s a false test to compare a Rembrandt self-portrait with the Mona Lisa. To grasp the real wonder of Leonardo you need to look at his drawings. He finished very few paintings and all are commissions in which self-expression struggles with patrons’ demands. It’s in his notebooks that Leonardo truly soars. In page after page he studies nature, designs machinery, invents weapons, plans fortifications and seeks the secret of flight.The greatest of all these visual investigations are his anatomical drawings. These are his artistic answers to Rembrandt’s portraits – and they are also miracles of science. He wrote of the dread he felt when he stayed up all night in a dissection room full of cadavers, alone with the dead. Out of these experiments he produced drawings that go – literally – deeper than Rembrandt. Instead of being moved by a face, Leonardo digs and cuts in search of life’s hidden structure. The drawings that record his fleshy discoveries outdo Rembrandt’s greatest portraits as images of what it is to be human. There’s no more moving work of art on earth than his depiction of a foetus in the womb, esconced as if in a capsule bound for the stars.The quivering mystery of Leonardo’s drawings of the lungs and heart, the precision of his studies of the eye and brain – these are his most sensitive as well as mind-boggling works. His anatomical drawings belong to the Queen and many will be touring the country this year.Sure, Rembrandt is the Shakespeare of painting. But Leonardo is Shakespeare, Einstein and the Wright brothers rolled into one. Come off it, Rijksmuseum. This just isn’t Rembrandt’s year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c7ace3f40ebe1e5e5b34057a45bfea3e9dd1c1/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e838d4cb364b72a94740125ea534270","title":"ask angie thomas your questions","story":"Got something you would like to ask the award-winning author of The Hate U Give? With the publication of her second YA novel coming up next month, here’s your chanceAngie Thomas is the author of the bestseller The Hate U Give, a novel for young adults that was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and which tells the story of Starr Carter, a 16-year-old African American girl who is drawn to activism after witnessing the police shooting of a childhood friend. Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University. Her second book On the Come Up, published in February, is a love letter to hip-hop and tells the story of Bri, a teenager who dreams of becoming the greatest rapper of all time. Thomas was a rapper as a teenager.We are offering readers the chance to put a question to the award-winning author: submit them in the comments section below, email us at review@observer, or tweet @ObsNewReview by 10am on Monday 14 January. Here are some Angie Thomas quotes to inspire you...“I grew up in a neighbourhood called Georgetown, which is the ’hood...I would hear gunshots at night… but one thing I did love about my neighbourhood growing up was the sense of community.”“When I couldn’t find myself in books, I found myself in the rhymes written by MCs who looked like me and shared my experiences.”“I’ve always seen writing as a form of activism. If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before they can promote empathy.”“Freedom of speech isn’t necessarily free, especially when you’re young and black.”“Every time a black girl comes up to me and says, ‘Thank you. It’s the first time I’ve seen myself in a book like this’, that’s better than hitting the New York Times bestseller list.”“Hashtags are nice, but I would ask people to put in some work!

In 2016, after a burst pipe wiped out a third of the shop’s stock, Miranda appealed to his fans to help with the Twitter hashtag #BuyABook, writing at length about his memories of the shop. Subsequently, the shop reported a dramatic increase in sales manager Shawn Verrier told PIX11 that customers were ringing to place large orders without specifying any titles: “People are calling in, saying can I buy $200 worth of books, you guys pick them out and just send them to me.”However, in October 2018, the shop’s vice-president Allen Hubby announced that it would be closing its shop in midtown – the home of the shop for two decades – due to rising rents, with the current lease set to end on 31 January.The three new owners – Miranda, Hamilton director Thomas Kail and James L Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organisation, which owns the Broadway theatre where the hit play is currently running – purchased the store from Rozanne Seelen, whose husband bought the shop in 1958. She told the New York Times that she had sold it for the cost of her remaining stock, rent support for the next few weeks and the promise that she would stay on as a consultant.“It’s the chronic problem – the rents were just too high, and I’m 84 years old – I just didn’t have the drive to find a new space and make another move,” she said. “Lin-Manuel and Tommy are my white knights.”After the purchase was announced, Miranda wrote on Twitter: “In 2002, I met with Tommy Kail in the Drama Book Shop. It gave us a place to go. Proud to be part of this next chapter. A place for you to go.”The bookshop will temporarily close on 20 January, before reopening in its new home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e060f82ce815c08931fddd3bf2e053ce3ef83ab6/785_964_1952_1171/master/1952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e461b2c0629fae1959c5b7144f2e14","title":"normal people sally rooney novel literary phenomenon of decade","story":"Booksellers are keeping stashes behind counters, others are having to put signs in windows to say it’s in stock … What is it about the novel that has resonated with so many people?A good measure of a book’s success is: are booksellers tired of being asked if they have it in stock? In one south London bookshop, the owner has put a sign in the window advising that yes, they do have copies of Sally Rooney’s Normal People, the literary phenomenon of the year.This week, Rooney, 27, became the youngest novelist ever to land the Costa awards’ best novel category. Normal People is now favourite to win the prize for overall book of the year at the end of the month. Her second novel has been a surprise – not for its quality, which was assured after her confident debut Conversations with Friends – but for the response to it. There hasn’t been a literary novel that has had such an impact on conversation beyond the usual huddles of luvvies since perhaps Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom, or, before that, Monica Ali’s Brick Lane, or even before that, Zadie Smith’s White Teeth.Booksellers have said they are keeping a stash behind the counter, putting them in the hands of customers before they can even blurt: “Do you have …” Not that they mind it Waterstones staff named it as their favourite book to recommend last year, while one Hatchards bookseller says it was the first book the chain had began to see more commonly sold in multiples, to people eager to share it with friends. I was buying three copies at the time.So why has it become the novel of the moment – and, arguably, the decade? Normal People is a quiet, literary novel – but it is a zeitgeist novel too (despite being set five years ago). It’s hard not to emerge from Rooney’s book about two young people navigating adulthood in post-crash Ireland and sense that, somehow, the author has spotted something intangible about our time and exposed it. Like other zeitgeist novels, from Gone With the Wind, when mass-fiction began booming in the 1930s, to Franzen’s post 911 tome Freedom, Normal People has trapped a moment – in this case, our new sense of collective precariousness – whether inidual, economic or political.It is the first novel I have read that has convincingly captured what it is to be young today: often overeducated, neurotic, slightly too self-aware. So much can be read into the aspiration of the male character Connell to one day “start going to dinner parties and having conversations about the Greek bailout” – a dream for a young man with preconceived ideas about what successful adults do. Or, indeed, to fellow protagonist Marianne’s sense that “her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it”.“Hysterical realism” was the name the critic James Wood once gave to the mid-2000s boom of novels ostensibly deliberately setting out to capture the moment. He was not a fan of novels he saw as overstuffed with symbolism and real world events. But what Rooney does differently from Ian McEwan’s Saturday (the Iraq war) or Zadie Smith’s White Teeth (multiculturalism and globalisation) is to ensure it never feels like a lesson.The most compelling question the novel poses is, simply: will Marianne and Connell eventually be happy? In one scene in Normal People, Connell is so engrossed by Jane Austen’s Emma that he loses track of time and, leaving the library, he marvels: “It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him.” There it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373008075cfecbc184b6c736d1d37342463c0a2f/0_90_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1890c5b3954d1290b53a6d40ade704d","title":"what are your favourite independent bookshops and why","story":"As independent bookshop numbers rise for the second year in a row after 20 years of decline, we want to hear about your favourites After weathering two decades of decline, that also saw the rise of Amazon and fall of international chains like Borders, independent bookshops appear to be in good health, bucking current high street trends.

So we put it back in and the next thing we knew we’d won $493. Luckiest dip ever,” they said.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, said he had been “stunned” by the advert and would be discussing the matter urgently with cross-party colleagues. He said: “Utterly appalling. What were they thinking?”A cross-party parliamentary group of MPs, led by the Labour MP Carolyn Harris, is expected to write to BA to condemn it for “glamorising” gambling.The advert aired just weeks after gambling companies agreed strict limits on their own TV commercials to address concerns about the impact of a surge in gambling ads on vulnerable people, addicts and children.A spokeswoman for the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the regulator had received several complains about the advert “on grounds that it promotes gambling and portrays it in a glamorous and frivolous way, and that it’s therefore irresponsible”.Marc Etches, the chief executive of the UK’s leading gambling charity GambleAware, raised concerns about the lack of messages about addiction that are required to appear alongside marketing for gambling companies.“With 370,000 problem gamblers in Great Britain it is vital that we recognise gambling for the public health issue it is,” he said. “The consequences of problem gambling can be devastating for iniduals and families alike, and companies need to recognise their responsibility to make sure people are aware of the risks of gambling.”Matt Zarb-Cousin, of Fairer Gambling, who was at the centre of a successful campaign to restrict fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), criticised BA’s choice of theme for its advert.“If BA instead glorified pot smoking to promote a route to Amsterdam in adverts shown before the watershed, it would surely raise some eyebrows. There is very little difference here.”BA is expected to face calls to withdraw the advert, which also drew fire from Twitter users.A British Airways Holidays spokesperson said: “This advert is one of a series which has been broadcast by us over the last three years, promoting a range of special memories that millions of British Airways Holidays’ customers experience when they travel with us every year.“The advert was cleared with the industry body, Clearcast, ensuring it is appropriate for broadcast.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dfd6ff01aae8a95d80212119ccefd2eae0039db/0_256_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdbff109be9fa6345e7a95dc030e7318","title":"christmas retail the winners and losers on the uk high street","story":"Demand for unicorns fuelled festive gains for Dunelm, but alarm bells sounded for HMVThe 2018 festive shopping season got underway with low expectations for the retail sector.

The 1919 atrocities in Amritsar jolted the Nobel laureate into accepting that that his Knight Commander of the British Empire (the KBE still in use today) could not be treated as unconnected to the bloodied realities of that empire’s operations.The belief that titles such as Officer, Dame Commander or Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire can be treated as purely symbolic, untainted by the gross brutalities of the imperial project, appear more plausible today, with historical distance. Accepting his Order of the British Empire, the public historian David Olusoga, who has a Nigerian father, has insisted defensively that while “the empire was an extractive, exploitative, racist and violent institution”, the fact that “there isn’t an empire any more” changes things completely.The E-word is now a slightly retro empty term – a little bit distasteful, for sure, but happily emancipated from any historical reference. However, Olusoga’s comforting thought runs counter to the British establishment’s own adamantine but honest refusal, despite official criticism of the word as “anachronistic” and “insensitive”, to substitute “empire” in these titles with something less isive and racially charged. It also ignores the extent to which aspirations to a resurgent imperial global grandeur have resurfaced, so explicitly and harmfully in the case for Brexit. Is the empire really over, or has it remained a virus-like sleeper cell in the British political imagination?The black scholar Paul Gilroy suggests that Britain’s refusal to accept the loss of empire has produced “deluded patterns of historical reflection and self‑understanding”. Surely it is the task of black and Asian Britons to undo, not pander to, these delusions.The most eloquent case for descendants of the enslaved, the indentured and the colonised to refuse honours that exalt the British empire was made by the poet Benjamin Zephaniah in this paper. He linked his own rejection of an OBE in 2003 not just to past atrocities or a “betrayal” of enslaved ancestors but to the very real afterlife of empire: racism, police brutality, privatisation, militarism, ongoing economic dispossession and the retention of the spoils of empire. One is either “profoundly anti-empire” or one accepts its many self-serving fictions along with the honour, including the notion that despite a few mishaps, it was a largely benevolent enterprise.Zephaniah’s choice was based on clear principles, from a long and often forgotten tradition of black and Asian resistance to the global harm inflicted by empire, and the understanding that imperial and domestic rule were maintained by paternalism, buying loyalties heading off dissenters at the pass and ensuring that criticism was toned down. In the 1930s, the fiercely anti-colonial black British newspaper International African Opinion identified “the judicious management of the black intelligentsia, giving them jobs, OBEs and even knighthoods” as a key tactic for diffusing confrontation.Bestowing knighthoods on African chiefs (indirect rule) and Indian princes elicited their assistance in controlling the colonised masses, though this was not always possible given widespread resistance. A select class of non-white leaders could be upheld as exemplars of a just system even as the large majority continued to face widespread discrimination and inequality.Olusoga suggests that, by acknowledging the “incredible achievements of black and Asian Britons”, OBEs can be seen as a defeat of racism. Apart from the ways in which tokenism usually enables hierarchical and exclusionary systems to continue business as usual, the more vital question is whether OBEs actually facilitate what Olusoga correctly describes as the “need to confront” not celebrate the history of empire. The role of an officer of the empire is hardly calculated to induce that much-needed confrontation.The British establishment, utterly reliant on fictions of imperial glory and benevolence, is not so naive as to facilitate its own undoing. Olusoga and others are fully entitled to their personal choices and private compromises. What is more questionable is the presentation of these personal decisions as politically sound choices made selflessly in the name of all black Britons.Does having a few black names with OBE after them really signify that the British establishment acknowledges the profound historical contributions of black and Asian people to this nation, not least through producing much of its wealth? Beyond exceptional inidual achievement, non-white Britons have also collectively organised for rights, fought racism challenged the empire, lobbied for legislation, run for political office, led demonstrations, produced community newspapers, and engaged in radical political education. So no: the “only options on the table” are not “to accept or decline” a seat at it. The real task is to bring this country to an understanding of what empire was, did and continues to do – and to question how a genuinely democratic decolonisation can be achieved in future.• Priyamvada Gopal is a lecturer at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f5a5c003c8148bd7d6011c802544e9512bca49/0_633_3312_1988/master/3312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd68fc08a990099123cd3332639325c6","title":"teaching chemistry students how to cook thats a experiment i can get behind","story":"Through cooking I have learned a lot about science, despite being a chemistry brain-dud. Maybe it can work the other way aroundImperial College London is including cookery lessons in its chemistry degree courses, starting this September. The Introduction to Culinary Practice module, created in collaboration with the chef Jozef Youssef from the Basque Culinary Centre, will allow students to “experience the ambiguities and challenges of translating written instructions into action” (AKA “following a recipe”). There are several reasons why I think this is a great idea, only some of which hold academic weight.I met Youssef several years ago, and he is one of the most absurdly good-looking men I have ever set eyes upon. He looks like a young Antonio Banderas had sex with a Magimix in Zorro’s kitchen. His science-theory-inflected food is extraordinary, too. At the tasting menu I attended, we ate origami pasta, oyster ice-cream and fossilised squash. One course was based on a Mexican folk tale and there was a mushroom dish based around the scent of petrichor. I was like a kid in a candy store. Not a real candy store, obviously, a virtual one, with piped custard aromas and implanted happy memories. Molecular gastronomy gets a bad rap from traditional food critics, seen as “all fur coat, no knickers”, but it’s right up my street. Spherification, emulsions, foams, there’s a Roald Dahl-esque theatre to this type of food that I love.Another good sign is that the professor of surgical education and engagement science who spearheaded the changes is called Roger Kneebone. I hope that’s not one of the techniques he has pioneered. Is there anyone who doesn’t feel their purpose on Earth bolstered by such a delightful piece of nominative determinism? I wonder if the years of hearing bad jokes have broken him. Anyway, his involvement guarantees the course’s success. It’s meant to be.Is cooking really educational? It’s not a trivial question. According to Kneebone, the thigh bone’s connected – no, hold on. According to Kneebone, many surgical students spend so much time on screens that they have lost the dexterity to stitch patients. OkayOK, he does sound a little bit broken. The idea behind this course is that the practical skills required by cooking will be invaluable to a new generation of scientists. And I believe that’s true. Just look at The Great British Bake Off: some of its best contestants, such as Rahul Mandal and Andrew Smyth, make brownies with a set square.Cooking is one of the best teachers I’ve known. Not only has it kept me sane and healthy, it has also got me more interested in the science of food and its preparation, despite being a chemistry brain-dud who thought an ionic bond was a Greek spy. Through cooking, I became interested in Maillard reactions and nasal receptors, fermentation, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic magic of egg yolks, denaturing proteins and the vibrational spectra of courgettes. There’s no reason this wouldn’t work the other way around – that booksmart students can’t develop their powers of observation, adaptation and hands-on ability by making chips or turning out a spotted dick.The university has indicated that, as part of the module, the students will have access to research instruments such as centrifuges, rotary evaporators and sonic homogenisers just picturing these God-level gadgets has me breaking out in excitement hives. It’s great these chemistry undergraduates will be bettering our understanding of the world and if that dream collapses like a soufflé, they will still have some great transferable skills. They could open an organic vegetarian restaurant, called Stems. No? Jeez, you get more of a reaction from helium. Thank you, I’m here all week.

The first is to try to pull off the psychological trick of persuading MPs that the mood is changing, and that they had better fall in line before they miss the bus. The second is to blackmail them by painting a picture of how awful the alternative to the prime minister’s deal is, underlining that the responsibility for the ensuing chaos will lie with MPs who vote against her.Unfortunately for Theresa May, neither of these ruses is likely to work this time. No 10 has been briefing since before Christmas that it is making progress with the European Union on the backstop and will soon be able to unveil changes that will make the plan acceptable to the rebels. Downing St also says it is in talks with the Democratic Unionist party – and if the DUP changes position on her deal, so will most pro-Brexit Tory rebels. This is either whistling in the wind or, more likely, deliberately misleading.The DUP’s demands that the backstop be made time limited, or that the UK should be able to end it unilaterally, are impossible because they defy logic. The backstop cannot be time limited exactly because it is a backstop. Any end to the backstop needs to be conditions-based, not time-based, when an alternative way has been found to preserve the open border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland. Despite two years of looking, neither the government nor the Brexiteers have found an even remotely satisfactory alternative. This means that it is impossible to amend the backstop as the DUP wants, without destroying it, even if Brussels were willing to do so. So the best that May can hope for is some warm words from an anxious-to-help Brussels suggesting the EU does not want the backstop to be permanent.The prime minister may hope this will somehow be enough to persuade the DUP to change its position and support her. In my experience of dealing with the DUP over many years, she is likely to be disappointed. When its leaders say something, it should be taken literally. Getting them to back down is usually not an option, as she discovered to her cost a year ago.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government.That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.So she has little chance of persuading the DUP – and by extension the mass of Brexiteer Tory MPs – to back her deal. That leaves her with the final tool, of blackmail. The reason why the government is now upping the rhetoric on how awful a no-deal Brexit will be is perfectly transparent. No deal is no longer better than a bad deal: it is her deal or Armageddon. And she wants to make MPs believe that if they vote her deal down, they will be held personally responsible by their constituents for the impact on voters’ lives.I find this threat entirely incredible. The reason why a no-deal Brexit is not going to happen has nothing to do with there being a majority in parliament against it. Parliament has no say in stopping the inexorable progress of article 50, which will take us out of the EU at the end of March this year.Rather, it is the instinct for self-preservation that will make the government pull the emergency brake in the end and ask Brussels for more time – as it can do at any moment up until the end of March. It will do so because is knows how grave the impact would be on day-to-day life in Britain, and it knows that the people will blame No 10 for the chaos – not Brussels or rebel backbench MPs.If there remain those in No 10 who do not know this to be true, they can take it from me: I lived through the fuel crisis in 2000, when tanker drivers blockaded the fuel depots and we came within hours of having to invoke emergency powers to keep hospitals operating and money in cash machines. Labour’s opinion poll ratings fell through the floor, and we trailed substantially behind the Tories for the first and only time.Luckily we broke the blockade quickly, but I learned that there is one thing the public expects above all else, and that is that the government governs. That is its job, and it is why people elect it. If it presides over chaos, as Edward Heath did with the three-day week, the government will be out on its ear in short order. May will not want to risk that ignominious fate.Neither happy talk about imminent breakthroughs nor blackmail will save May’s deal. Once again, the government is wasting time on delusions. The only way out of this mess is for the government to reach for the emergency brake and ask the EU to extend article 50. The sooner it does so, the better.• Jonathan Powell was chief of staff to Tony Blair from 1995 to 2007"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d2cac32ad62af46d2cdbc5a5de21aa2e79c0499/0_98_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b28661b539b5e640456f05ff6dcee8f4 220w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of healthy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘healthy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘healthy’.Share your photos of what healthy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 January at 10am.

He also described the devastating impact his suspension and the way it was conducted had on his mental health and wellbeing, and that of his family.Davies led the university for 15 years during a time of huge expansion, when student numbers doubled and the institution moved up the league tables. He was one of four members of staff to be suspended, including the dean of the school of management, Prof Marc Clement, who has also denied any wrongdoing and lodged a formal grievance.In his letter, the vice-chancellor called for his suspension to be withdrawn and the disciplinary process to be postponed pending the outcome of his grievance. He said he had been “treated appallingly”, and claimed he was facing “unfounded and disingenuous allegations” and had been suspended “illegitimately and dishonestly”, causing irreversible damage to his reputation and health.A spokesperson for the university, responding to Davies’s allegations, insisted the correct procedures had been followed throughout the investigation and said appropriate support had been offered to him.According to the letter, Davies said he was given no warning he was to be suspended. He claimed he was escorted off the university campus by the head of security and left “entirely socially isolated” after being banned from contacting colleagues.Davies said the conditions of his suspension meant he was also banned from unaccompanied access to the university-owned house that had been his family home for the past 15 years, a move he described as “punitive” and “malicious”.“Beyond the massive inconvenience of not having access to my clothes, personal items and mail, being excluded from my own home at the incredibly difficult time immediately after my suspension had a huge effect on my mental health and wellbeing,” the letter said.The personal consequences were however “dwarfed” by the potential damage to the institution, he said. “I am being mentally tormented by the almost daily news in the media evidencing the damage this is all doing to the reputation of the university I love, with serious implications for its future financial health,” the letter said.The university has not confirmed the reasons for the suspensions, but Davies’ letter detailed an allegation of gross misconduct and an accusation of “having failed to assure appropriate due diligence, governance and systems of control around major projects and the commercial activities of the university”.It is virtually unprecedented for a vice-chancellor to be suspended in the UK higher education sector, where senior management figures usually quietly retire.The allegations at Swansea were understood to focus on the university’s involvement in the development of a “wellness and life science village” in the Delta Lakes area of Llanelli. The project, which has been led by Carmarthenshire county council, was put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry at Swansea University.A university spokesperson said: “The suspensions were made following a thorough and wide-reaching internal investigation.“This is still ongoing, so it would not be appropriate to comment in detail at this time, but the university has at all times acted fully in accordance with its own ordinances, and offered appropriate support to Prof Davies.”Asked about the vice-chancellor’s claims of being banned from his family home, the university said Davies had indicated that he and his family had moved out of the property in the summer of 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb4fd943ded225b3ad0c325932e355a7cbd7b3f/506_318_4187_2512/master/4187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=435dccbedda7c644ed332eb879043149","title":"birdwatch i spot 55 species on 1 jan but its not about numbers","story":"The local birdlife grace me with their sheer life-force as 2019 dawnsA new day, a new year, and my traditional early start.

We’re reeling, and we’re all just kind of hoping that the worst hasn’t happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3abd2f95c9cdb893e56a0f05e9245d381cedb9d/0_132_1376_826/master/1376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c3766ed67fd9fb1ce83f4aa8d08383b","title":"sixty four metre fatberg discovered in english seaside resort sidmouth devon","story":"Eight weeks needed to remove mass of fat, oil and wet-wipes from sewer in Sidmouth, DevonA block of hardened fat, oil and wet-wipes longer than six double-decker buses has been discovered in a sewer metres from the sea in a popular Devon resort town.It will take workers eight weeks to cut up and remove the 64-metre “fatberg” from the sewer beneath The Esplanade in Sidmouth.South West Water is also planning to open a pop-up shop in the town to inform people about the unwanted visitor and to urge them not to “feed” fatbergs by pouring fat, oil, grease and wet-wipes into the system.The company’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said: “It shows how this key environmental issue is not just facing the UK’s cities, but right here in our coastal towns.“It is the largest discovered in our service history and it will take our sewer team around eight weeks to dissect this monster in exceptionally challenging work conditions.“Thankfully it has been identified in good time with no risk to bathing waters.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way.

It won best short film and special jury award at the Cannes Lions festival in June 2018 (a separate event from the high profile film festival), and went on to win the grand prix at the Odense film festival in Denmark, which qualified it to be considered for an Academy Award.Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Bulger’s father Ralph said that Lambe had failed to contact him. “Not once has the maker of this film contacted me or any of James’s family about this film … It has been 26 years since my son was taken and murdered and so I have seen many documentaries and news stories about him. But I have never been so cut up and offended by something that shows so little compassion to James and his family.“I accept this is a murder of such magnitude it will always be written about and featured in the news but to make a film so ­sympathetic to James’s killers is devastating.”Lambe had previously defended his film during an interview on Good Morning Britain after the Academy had announced its live action short film shortlist in December, when it was revealed Detainment had made it to the final nine films. Lambe, a director of commercials and music videos, said that the film “isn’t meant to bring any further anguish” to the family.In a statement released in response to Fergus’s appearance on Loose Women, Lambe said the film “had not been made for financial gain” and apologised to her for not contacting her prior to making the film, but defended it as “in no way sympathetic to the killers and does not attempt to make excuses for them”. “There has been criticism that the film ‘humanises’ the killers, but if we cannot accept that they are human beings, we will never begin to understand what could have driven them to commit such a horrific crime. The only way to prevent something similar happening in the future is if we understand the cause of it.”Thompson and Venables were both released in 2001 and given new identities. Venables was returned to prison in 2010 over child pornography offences after being released in 2013, he pleaded guilty to child pornography offences in 2018, and is currently imprisoned.The Oscar nominations will be announced on 22 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626b685db82e8b2f709da5c3ad898841fc332399/142_99_4140_2485/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aafadcbc76a17d76d923e14c4ca69373","title":"everton farhad moshiri marco silva","story":"Everton’s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, has told Marco Silva the club’s league position “is just not good enough” while claiming his latest managerial appointment retains the board’s total support.Moshiri told Everton’s general meeting he was confident the managerial team of the director of football, Marcel Brands, who has been appointed to the club’s board, and the chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, would deliver on his long-term project. That aim, according to the CEO, is “to win Premier League titles and compete regularly in the Champions League in a world-class, world-renowned football stadium” at Bramley Moore dock.For Silva, however, there was clear instruction that results had to improve in the second half of his first season. Everton are 11th, having won once in eight league games, and have the same number of points as at the same stage of the last underwhelming campaign.Moshiri, who admitted “bad luck and poor judgment” had featured in his £250m investment so far, said: “We did our homework and we put a big bet on Marco and we stick with him. He has our total support and we have a professional in Marcel Brands who monitors the progress. Consistency has been an issue but we have had some terrific performances and the challenge in the second half is to have more of those performances. The football management team are totally focused on it. We know what we are and I’m comfortable.”Everton’s majority shareholder insisted the proposed £500m stadium project would proceed, though the deputy chairman, Keith Harris, warned of challenges regarding Brexit, inflation and heritages issues on the waterfront site.“We have a lot of experience so I think we will complete this stadium. Be sure that will happen. And I will throw as much money as needed. Private markets will provide £350m, naming rights will give us some more and we will maybe have an equity gap of £100m. I think this club under the management of Marcel and leadership of Denise is sufficiently robust to see the project through. It is no luxury, we have to get it done.

The manager hopes supporters see the bigger picture how he has the club punching above their weight when it comes to things like balance sheets.Pochettino wants to win this Carabao Cup semi-final purely for the thrill of winning and his team have put their noses in front before the second leg at Stamford Bridge, which has been scheduled for Thursday 24 January.There was very little in it here and Maurizio Sarri – who is also without a trophy from his managerial career – departed cursing Chelsea’s lack of cutting edge. They were the team that pushed and they created the chances to have taken some reward. They could also lament the manner in which two chances came back off the post.It was Harry Kane, inevitably, who scored the only goal – from the penalty spot – but one thing was clear. It is set up extremely nicely for the return.Wembley had been the scene of Chelsea nightmares in late November when they simply did not turn up to the Premier League fixture with Spurs. The 3-1 scoreline was a mercy. When Sarri reflected recently on his first season in English football, he mentioned the losses to Wolves and Leicester as his regrets. The Spurs mauling? “I don’t talk about that,” Sarri said.Pochettino started with the same system, with Dele Alli in a roving role behind Son Heung-min and Kane partly to construct a creative platform for Alli, partly to ask him to stifle Jorginho when Chelsea had possession. That had been the basis of the league victory.Alli released Son early on with a lovely ball over the top, which Andreas Christensen just about dealt with, and Chelsea could feel that they had made a solid start. Kane saw an overhead kick thud into Kepa Arrizabalaga – it was straightforward for the goalkeeper – while, at the other end, Chelsea had flickered.The tone changed on 24 minutes when Spurs got the penalty from which Kane banged home his 160th goal for the club, lifting him above Cliff Jones into fourth place on the all-time list. A reminder: Kane is still only 25. The execution was nerveless and clinical.Arrizabalaga’s challenge on Kane was a clear penalty. The striker had fastened on to Toby Alderweireld’s long ball and touched decisively past the outrushing Arrizabalaga before being clattered by him. But the assistant referee had flagged for offside, which looked extremely tight and so we went to VAR, which is in effect in the Carabao Cup.It took an age to clear up whether Kane had been level with the last man or otherwise but in the end, he was proved to have timed his run to perfection. There can be no arguing with the technology. Arrizabalaga was booked.Sarri had included Callum Hudson-Odoi from the start, which provided a rich narrative strand. On the day Bayern Munich raised their offer for the 18-year-old winger to £35m, the Chelsea manager clearly wanted to show him he has a future at Stamford Bridge. Álvaro Morata was unavailable because of a minor hamstring problem.Hudson-Odoi worked Paulo Gazzaniga with a low shot on seven minutes and a mixed bag of a first half for him almost ended with glory. His cross deflected off Danny Rose and looked to have caught out Gazzaniga only for the goalkeeper to backtrack and claw the ball against the far post. Alderweireld completed the clearance. Moments earlier, N’Golo Kanté had volleyed against the same post from Marcos Alonso’s cross. Chelsea were unlucky to be behind at the interval.Spurs were determined, as ever, to build from the back and that risked losing the ball as Sarri ordered his players to press high. There were murmurs of exasperation, at times, from the home crowd. Spurs’s quest to break the Chelsea lines and create a telling pocket of space was a key facet of the tactical battle.When you have Kane, often only the slightest of openings are required and he extended Arrizabalaga on 52 minutes after slick work from Moussa Sissoko and Alli. Kane’s movement carried latent menace. But Chelsea pressed on to the front foot. They fought to pen Spurs in and there was a coherence to some of their build-up play. The chances followed. Eden Hazard, who turned sharply and probed throughout, worked Gazzaniga on more than one occasion while Kanté also forced him into a save.Chelsea shouted in vain for handballs inside the area against Rose and Alderweireld but the moment when their hearts skipped came in the 58th minute. Ross Barkley flicked on a corner and there was Christensen, all alone at the far post. He scuffed his shot wide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e371d395754f6df5f1bc795bb6d3e0a9d21dca0/201_0_2779_1668/master/2779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe876152d8a928df3e979e9a1dc439f","title":"tottenham hotspur v chelsea carabao cup semi final live","story":"Chelsea dominated possession and created more chances, but Harry Kane’s penalty gave Spurs the advantage at the halfway point of this semi-final.So that’s your lot. Spurs take a one-goal lead to Stamford Bridge in a fortnight, with both managers fuming about VAR. It promises to be an exciting second leg. Until then, thanks for reading, and goodnight!And now a word with a seething Maurizio Sarri. “I saw a few minutes ago the video, and it was offside. But it’s not important. The linesman stopped his run, he didn’t follow the ball, and had a big influence on our defenders. So at the moment I don’t think the English referees are able to use the system. If you are not sure with the system you have to follow the ball, but he stopped, and so for our defenders he was offside. I don’t know about the keeper, but I know about our defenders. They have to study the system. It is very strange that there is no system in the Premier League but in the Carabao Cup there is. It is very strange for us, the players, and I think also the referees. We played very well, I am really very happy with my players.”Mauricio Pochettino speaks in a full and frank manner about VAR. “I don’t like VAR. Today we got the benefit, but watching the World Cup or another league like La Liga, no-one is happy from day one that they started to use it. To get the benefit is nice, of course, but I am not happy to win games like this. I am pro-technology because you cannot stop evolution. But waiting how we wait ... the rules are not clear. I am watching every week in La Liga and no-one is happy, whether they are fighting for the title or against relegation. It should be a good example for us, because we still have six months to prove the system, and there is still a lot of work to do.”David Hytner was our man at Wembley. Here’s his report.Harry Kane talks to Sky Sports! “I made the run, played to the whistle, nicked it round the keeper. It was a clear penalty, just a matter of whether it was offside or not. Obviously I wasn’t sure, I was just running through on goal, but VAR is there for a reason. I’m sure they got it right. VAR is part of the game, a big part of football going forward. Chelsea had a point to prove, we knew it was going to be tough. It’s a win, it’s what we came here to do. Now we can go for it.”Danny Rose, who has won the man-of-the-match award, adds: “It was hard work, and it’ll be even harder when we play them in the return leg. But it was a great team performance and I think we deserved it in the end. We tried to get the second, but it was one of those games, Chelsea played really well. There’s going to be pressure on them to come at us in the second leg, but we’re one of the best counter-attacking teams in the league. We’re not going to try to protect, we’re going to try to win it.”Meanwhile some dispiriting news from Wembley ...That second leg will be played at Stamford Bridge on Thursday 24 January. The final comes along a month later, on Sunday 24 February. Spurs are in the box seat, but Chelsea will take heart from their performance tonight - they hit the woodwork twice, and had the better of the possession, territory and chances created. They’ll fancy their chances of turning this one around. Put another way: this semi-final is beautifully poised. Gotta love the League Cup! Don’t you dare listen to the miserable buggers who keep talking a good competition down.And that’s it! Spurs hang on for victory, and they’ll take a one-goal lead to Stamford Bridge in a fortnight’s time! Chelsea were probably the better team on balance, but that man Harry Kane was the difference. There’s a bit of a face-off between Rose and Rudiger after the final whistle, but everyone calms down soon enough.90 min +3: Hazard dribbles down the left and earns a corner off Kane. It’s all hands to the pump for Spurs. Hazard takes the corner himself, and again it’s not up to much. Spurs whack clear.90 min +2: Kovacic bursts down the left, then slips the ball inside for Hazard, who shuttles it further to Kante. This is a glorious flowing move, but just as it looks like Chelsea are about to do something both pretty and pretty dramatic, Rose crunches into Kante with great power. What a saving tackle!90 min +1: Spurs make their final change in the game-management style. Eriksen is replaced by Llorente.90 min: Winks is replaced by Skipp. Hazard, down the left, pulls a ball back for Pedro. But Pedro’s swarmed by white shirts before he can get a shot away. There will be three added minutes.88 min: Chelsea continue to press forward. But suddenly Spurs break, and Kane has the ball out on the left. He curls a low pass into the centre for Lamela, who seems to have got the better of Alonso. He’d be free, but the ball clanks between his legs. Eventually he’s forced to drag Alonso, who has recovered, to the ground. Spurs so close to a priceless two-goal first-leg advantage!86 min: Hazard stands stock still, just to the right of the Spurs box. He suddenly bursts past Alli and Rose to reach the byline and stands one up in the middle. Gazzaniga fumbles. Sanchez hacks out with Giroud lurking. The ball breaks left for Alonso, whose shot is deflected into the air harmlessly.84 min: Pedro dinks one in from the right. Sanchez eyebrows it away, but only to Alonso on the left. Alonso looks to flash a cross to Giroud at the near post, but gets too much on it the ball misses the striker and Gazzaniga claims.83 min: Hazard’s free kick is easily dealt with by Sanchez. His set-piece delivery hasn’t been all that tonight.82 min: Hazard looks to turn down the inside-right channel and is unceremoniously clattered to the floor by Lamela. The substitute, only just on, is booked.80 min: Both teams make a change. Son is replaced by Lamela, while the very promising Hudson-Odoi makes way for Giroud, who as an erstwhile employee of Arsenal gets the reception you’d expect.76 min: Barkley is replaced by Kovacic.74 min: Hazard cuts in from the right and flicks a pass down the channel for Kante. The ball slaps Alderweireld’s arm. You’ve seen those given - he’s close, but not super-close - but the referee isn’t interested. Neither is the VAR dude. In fairness to Alderweireld, upon second view, he might have been trying to take his arm away.72 min: It’s been a fast-paced match pretty much from the get-go. Hazard makes good ground down the right but is stopped by Alli Kane flicks a pass down the left which Son busts a gut in trying to reach. Nothing’s quite coming off at the moment, for either team, but you can’t mark anyone down for effort. It’s made for a great spectacle.70 min: Good work by Azpilicueta down the right earns Chelsea a corner. But Hazard’s delivery is uncharacteristically dismal, failing to beat the first man.68 min: Wembley is bubbling away. This has been a highly entertaining semi so far, and the crowd are doing their bit. It’s a great atmosphere. And people say the League Cup doesn’t count for anything. Don’t listen to them, kids.66 min: Sissoko powers down the right. Kane takes over and hooks the ball further down the wing. Son nearly breaks into the box. He can’t get a shot away. But Sissoko has kept going, and nearly gets the ball under control on the penalty spot. Nearly, but not quite. A hectic, seat-of-pants attack finally comes to an end. But Chelsea were nearly opened up for the first time in a while. That break for Kane’s treatment has done Spurs some good.65 min: The Spurs physio gives Kane the thumbs up, despite the star striker mumbling something about his calf. Kane’s back in the action soon enough.64 min: Kane is down looking pained. As he gets treatment, it’s a chance for Spurs to regroup. They’ve been second best since the restart.63 min: Willian is replaced by Pedro, who scored here for Barcelona in the 2011 Champions League final, the opening goal of their 3-1 victory over Manchester United.62 min: Hazard dribbles down the right, enters the Spurs box, and takes a shot. It’s high and wide, but the ref decides it’s come off Alderweireld for a corner. Replays aren’t conclusive, so it’s probably for the best that the set piece comes to nought.61 min: Chelsea are pressing Spurs back. The home side can’t get out of their final third. Hudson-Odoi, Willian, Kante and Hazard are seeing an awful lot of the ball down the right, but can’t prise the hosts open. There’s a sense that it might only be a matter of time, though.59 min: Sanchez comes straight through the back of Hazard in the centre circle and goes into the referee’s notebook.58 min: Hazard jinks down the right and crosses. It loops off Rose and over the crossbar. For a second, Gazzaniga was worried about the freak looper there. It’s a corner from the right. Hazard whips it to the near post, where Barkley flicks to the far post. Christensen is haring in, unchallenged. But he clanks his volley wide left from close range. What a chance that was!57 min: Azpilicueta has three goes at delivering a cross into the Spurs box from the right. The third attempt hits the arm of Rose, and the Chelsea man wants a penalty. But the ref’s not interested there wasn’t much space between the two players, and no reaction time.55 min: Good work by Hudson-Odoi down the right. His deep cross is chested down by Trippier and gathered by Gazzaniga. Chelsea are beginning to dominate this.54 min: Another fine save by Gazzaniga, who denies Kante’s dipper, turning the ball away from his right-hand post. Chelsea will soon start wondering what they have to do to score.53 min: Hazard skedaddles in from the left , waltzes past Eriksen, and sends a dipping screamer straight down Gazzaniga’s gullet. There have been precious few signs that this game will end with just the one goal scored.52 min: Alli and Sissoko exchange passes as the ball’s shuttled in from the Spurs right. Kane is teed up, 30 yards out, and pearls one towards the bottom left. Kepa does extremely well to save. The resulting corner isn’t up to much.51 min: ... nowt. Gazzaniga plucks the corner from the sky. No sweat.50 min: Kante drives forward, and slips the ball right for Hudson-Odoi, who offloads to Hazard. Chelsea’s star man drops a shoulder and very nearly makes room for a shot from the edge of the box. But he’s crowded out so meanders right, then chips left towards Alonso at the far post. Sanchez rises to concede a corner. From which ...48 min: Sanchez impedes Hazard as he dribbles down the middle of the park. Willian takes the free kick, wedging the ball down the inside-right channel. Hudson-Odoi very nearly brings it down in acres of space - the rest of the box was loaded on the left - but just misses it. Gazzaniga gathers, and the flag had gone up for offside anyway.47 min: ... the ball’s worked to Eriksen, 20 yards out. He has a shot which Kepa gathers, but not in a wholly convincing style. For a second, it looked like he was in the process of fumbling it, but recovered his composure in time.46 min: Kane slips a reverse pass down the inside-right channel for Alli, who is stopped from shooting by the outstretched leg of Rudiger. Alli went over in the area, but it was a perfectly timed tackle. Corner, from which ...And we’re off again! Chelsea get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. Meanwhile here’s Ed Wall. “One thing I’m unclear about with the VAR decision on the offside - if the assistant referee has raised his flag during the buildup, doesn’t that completely affect how the players (especially on the defensive side) react? Shouldn’t he be keeping his flag down if the decision is marginal and leaving the decision to the VAR team? It strikes me that Kepa was completely baffled for a split second as to what to do, and this might have been poor keeping, or because he was unsure if Kane was really offside.” It’s almost as though VAR is just replacing one set of problems with another. But most people seem happy enough with it, so here we are.And that’s that for the first half. Chelsea shaded it in terms of possession, and have hit the post twice. But it’s Spurs who have the lead thanks to the power running of Harry Kane. The second half is poised perfectly. Don’t you go anywhere!45 min +2: So nearly a sensational equaliser! Hudson-Odoi Crosses from the right. The ball deflects off Rose and looks like looping over Gazzaniga and into the top left! But the keeper fingertips the ball onto the left-hand post. As the ball bounces across the face of goal, Alderweireld slams the ball clear. Spurs escape!45 min: Hudson-Odoi hasn’t stopped running all half. Here he doesn’t stop running into Rose, and earns a brief lecture from the referee.43 min: Alonso, deep on the left, curls into the box for Hazard, who can’t control. But the ball nearly drops to Hudson-Odoi, who momentarily considers van Bastening a volley goalwards from a position out right. But the ball deflects through to Gazzaniga.41 min: Chelsea are beginning to regain their early rhythm. Hudson-Odoi drifts in from the right, opens up his body, and looks to whip a curler into the top left. He overcooks it, but not by so much. It was Chelsea’s eighth attempt on goal so far Spurs have just had the two. But look at the scoreline.40 min: A little space for Alonso, set clear down the left by Willian. Alonso curls the ball to the near post, where Kante nips in ahead of Alderweireld and Trippier, and clips a first-time effort off the bottom of the left-hand post! Goal kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ef4f08312c9f279993a6bc5654efa599be534a3/366_545_4818_2891/master/4818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbaaee0a1c15aa11e7bf80c939a12454","title":"erland cooper musician orkney interview","story":"With geese as backing singers and a thousand children singing like starlings, the musician is sending his emotive ‘sonic postcards’ from Orkney to LondonThe rain lashes down, the wind whistles and a skein of pink-footed geese fly overhead, honking in the twilight, as Erland Cooper’s concert begins. Cley Marshes nature reserve on the Norfolk coast is an unusual place for a gig, but the perfect stage for an evening of music inspired by the birds of Orkney.Cooper, known for the folk-rock of Erland and the Carnival and the more experimental soundscapes of the Magnetic North, migrated to new terrain for his debut solo album Solan Goose, released last year. With its combination of contemporary classical, ambient and electronica, it drew comparisons to Sigur Rós, Ólafur Arnalds and other music of northerly latitudes, as well as radio play and winning admirers in unexpected places, from literary figures including John Burnside and Robert Macfarlane.“We were a wee bit stressed,” says Cooper to his audience in Cley, after a four-hour drive to the coast, “and all of a sudden the geese flew over and it reminded us why we make music. We want to take you to the Orkney islands, very slowly, very gently.” For all the gentleness, Cooper’s songs are deeply emotional and given lift by three classically trained multi-instrumentalists, particularly the wordless notes delivered by the soaring soprano of Lottie Greenhow.“If it moves me close to the point of tears, I’ve probably achieved what I wanted,” says Cooper when we meet the following week on London’s South Bank, where he’s rehearsing for an appearance with a rather different collaborator, Paul Weller.The “release” that Cooper finds in his spare electronic and classic “ecosystem of music” is matched by the release he finds in natural landscapes: “You can feel like you’re going to sob and you don’t quite know why.”He has created the music for Nest, a light and sound installation in Waltham Forest’s Lloyd Park which this weekend will mark the opening of the first ever London borough of culture. Cooper’s compositions sample the voices of 1,076 people from local school, community and gospel choirs. One listener praised his samples of birdsong Cooper was delighted – they were children impersonating a starling murmuration. “They pretended to be starlings, singing at random times which is exactly what you want, and very quickly they came together, and sang together, which is scary like Hitchcock,” he laughs.Solan Goose was hatched almost by accident. Cooper, born and raised on the archipelago of Orkney, was feeling increasingly stressed and claustrophobic in London. He’d arrive at his studio and turn a noise he had heard – a jackhammer perhaps – into a note, “create a drone out of it” and then improvise a piano over that. He named each recording after Orcadian dialect for island birds: solan goose (gannet), shalder (oystercatcher), tammie norie (puffin) and, most deliciously, cattie-face (short-eared owl). “It was a way to pull me home, pull me back to childhood memory. Before I knew it, I had this fully fledged thing,” he says.It wasn’t all quite that simple. In keeping with his commitment to Orkney traditions, Cooper tried putting traditional folk lyrics to his music. It didn’t work. “Imagine being on a South Ronaldsay beach and all of a sudden there’s this red balloon popping up in the middle, and you’re no longer looking at the landscape. It was so out of place, it had to go.”In fact, Cooper has found it a relief not to sing during a year of performing the album – beginning at the Walthamstow Wetlands nature reserve, in London, and taking in summer festivals that included Womad and Port Eliot. “I fell out of joy with my own voice,” he says. “It’s a habitual experience when you doubt whether you can sing in the first place.” Instead, he has embraced playing with classically trained musicians.“The classical world can be very intimidating for some, but I remind myself that music is just sounds, just patterns,” he says. “I’m always trying to write the simplest thing, trying to do more with fewer notes.”Cooper has completed the second of a trilogy of albums shaped by Orkney’s air, sea and land, as celebrated by Orkney poet George Mackay Brown. Solan Goose is the air the sea is next the record will be released in the spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4126cf1a80c60be19ca7ae984ebdb7d18843aa5b/175_99_1478_886/master/1478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a6e82533c85f8c05c62218f76d8008a","title":"kate bush clarifies political stance i am not a tory supporter","story":"Singer expressed support for Theresa May in 2016 but says she was simply celebrating a woman in powerKate Bush has written a statement clarifying her political beliefs, saying a magazine interview from 2016 “could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter, which I want to make clear I am not”.In the interview with the Canadian magazine Maclean’s, Bush was reported as voicing support for the British prime minister, Theresa May.Answering a question about Hillary Clinton and “the fear of women’s power”, she said: “We have a female prime minister here in the UK. I actually really like her and think she’s wonderful. I think it’s the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time. She’s a very intelligent woman but I don’t see much to fear. “I will say it is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She’s very sensible and I think that’s a good thing at this point in time.”Writing on her website, Bush says the quote was “out of context … it seemed as if the focus went on to the quote rather than the work. It was deeply frustrating.”She says she decided not to clarify her words at the time but was now moved to comment after the quote had been aired again in articles about her recently remastered back catalogue and a book of her collected lyrics. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power. I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power. I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time – because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.The latter reference is to David Cameron, who has been criticised for calling the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, which led to Brexit.Bush is still a relatively reclusive figure, and did no interviews around the recent reissues and lyric collection. In 2014, she performed her first live shows in 35 years, having not toured since her only ever run of live dates in 1979.She does write occasional messages on her website though, recently including tributes to the late recording engineer Geoff Emerick and the choreographer Lindsay Kemp. She also thanked fans this week for raising money for the homeless charity Crisis, drawn from sales at a London pop-up store set up over the Christmas period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56eb304bb0998efad286b81642834e47c39a6369/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd483cd731fb99ddf8bfb1bfae9e4c7","title":"the way the eu treated the uk opened my eyes bolsovers brexit","story":"Walking into the debating hall at a school in Bolsover during the EU referendum campaign, Kate Godfrey couldn’t quite believe her eyes. On the front row, ahead of the sixth-formers she had come to address in her role as east Midlands field manager for Britain Stronger in Europe, were five teachers wearing green ties advertising the Grassroots Out campaign.“Here” is Shirebrook, a former pit village five miles south-east of Bolsover, a market town famed for its allegedly haunted castle – as well as its cantankerous Beast, Dennis Skinner, MP since 1970. The main colliery, which employed more than 2,000 men in its heyday, closed in 1993. The mine shaft was filled in and Sports Direct, the bullish discount retailer, plonked its 75,000 sq metre (800,000 sq ft) headquarters on the site. Mitchell worked there when he was 16. Most young people in Shirebrook have at least had a holiday job in the gargantuan warehouse, where a  investigation in 2015 revealed workers were toiling for effectively less than the minimum wage. In the 13 years since Sports Direct moved in, thousands of eastern European people followed, taking up insecure agency jobs. Old miners moved out, their homes snapped up and then carved up by landlords sensing a quick buck. Bedrooms were ided in two by sheets of cardboard, sellotape on windows marking which half of the window belonged to which tenant. Living rooms became sleeping quarters, forcing new residents out into local parks to do their socialising, drinking cans of Tyskie and Żubr that had ousted stout and bitter from the corner shop.It has led to a “ided community”, believes Mitchell, who works 25-30 hours a week at Tesco, where he is a union steward, and is studying for a degree in sports coaching and development. “Now, I go out with a Polish girl personally and my best friend is Polish, but there has been an integration problem because there’s such a large amount of migrants, they’ve got their own shops where they speak Polish, they’ve got their own little communities and there’s this ide. In many ways, I think that’s what Thatcher wanted right from the beginning. She wanted to ide and conquer, and she’s been able to do it through European Union policy,” he said.Selling hot dogs outside Sports Direct last week, 27-year-old Chris Handley said his girlfriend used to work inside and voted leave partly as a result of her experience: “She struggled with work because her colleagues were from eastern Europe and she felt pushed out as a result.”Along with Mitchell, Ashley Taylor, 23, is one of the youth officers of Bolsover constituency Labour party. A landscape architect, he voted remain in the referendum but has now changed his mind. “I would vote to leave now because the way the EU has treated the UK on its exit has opened my eyes up a little bit. I’ve seen what they have been doing to other countries, particularly Greece,” he said. “As a Labour party member with Jeremy Corbyn at the helm, I believe in socialist values and I believe we could generally achieve more nationally under him than we could in the EU.”He is against a second referendum: “We’re already in a situation where domestic policies have been totally forgotten about because of Brexit. I don’t believe a second referendum would solve homelessness on our streets or improve our NHS.’”It is that sort of talk which makes Alan Gascoyne want to wring some young necks. A former miner down Shirebrook pit, the 63-year-old is now secretary of the Miners Welfare, a community centre and charity in the town. He has been listening to Naomi Crew, the 26-year-old barmaid at the Welfare, explain why she would probably have voted leave, had she actually turned out in the referendum. “People my age, people born after 1990, don’t know what it was like round here once – the Shirebrook Alan talks about, when people looked out for each other and the pits were still open and acted like glue for our community. We’ve never known it stitched together like that,” she said. “Maybe Shirebrook people used to look out for each other, but now it’s every man for himself.”Gascoyne is similarly dismayed at the rapidly diminishing Labour vote in the area. Skinner, a lifelong Eurosceptic who announced his plan to vote for Brexit in the Morning Star, has seen his majority slashed to 5,288 from 27,149 in 1997.The generational ties are breaking, sighed Gascoyne. “It was always the case that you voted how your dad voted and he voted how his dad voted. In one of the last elections my daughter rang me up and said, Dad, I’m thinking of voting Lib Dem. I said fine, but don’t show your face around our house any more.” He laments the lack of political education among many young people. “They don’t know that it was Labour that founded the NHS and that it is the EU which has given them many of their employment rights. They think they’ve just dropped from the sky.”Many young people the  meets in this large constituency just aren’t bothered: “Doesn’t make a difference to me, duck.” But Brexit will change Bolsover. Its biggest employer is already making contingencies for life outside the EU. Foreseeing a recruitment problem when the ready supply of young eastern Europeans is cut off, Sports Direct has been investing in some “partial automation for the Shirebrook warehouse operations” on internet fulfilment orders. This, according to the annual report, should “mitigate any potential staffing shortfall after Brexit”. We often hear that no one voted to be made poorer. They probably didn’t vote to lose their jobs to a robot either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b0073e1aa5f20b4a8331521eb0944ace858b2dd/0_429_5257_3154/master/5257.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bc6cb36e3f92f305092144d72b988fa9 440w","title":"brexit latest news no deal amendment liam fox says backing amendment designed to make no deal harder would be irresponsible politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the possible vote on the no-deal amendment during the finance bill debateWe’re going to close this live blog down now – at the end of another damaging day in the Commons for the prime minister. Here’s a summary of the latest events:You can see a summary of the day’s earlier events here. Thanks for reading this live blog. For those who want more, the  has set out its view on the process of exiting the European Union this evening:The Lib Dems’ Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, has a similar view to Lammy, insisting the prime minister must now rule out a no-deal Brexit:The Conservative government’s defeat this evening shows Parliament’s rejection of a no-deal. This amendment goes some way to taking no deal off the table, but it is crucial it is removed as an option entirely.Theresa May must stop gambling with our future. It is entirely within her power to take no deal off the table, however she is recklessly keeping it there as a scare tactic due to the lack of support for her deal.The only real alternative to get us out of this mess is to legislate for a people’s vote, with the option to remain in the EU.There were some rumours around earlier about an incident on the Parliamentary estate. The politan police have said the following:At around 7.20pm on Tuesday, 8 January, a man was arrested on suspicion of trespassing on a protected site as he tried to gain entry to the Palace of Westminster via Carriage Gates. He has been taken to a police station. No officers were injured.The incident is not being treated as terror-related.A little more detail on those Tory rebels – from the Daily ’s chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope:Labour’s David Lammy, who campaigns for the pro-remain Best for Britain group, says the prime minister’s Commons defeat means she must now rule out a no-deal Brexit.No-deal would be catastrophic for the country and Theresa May’s fourth defeat in four weeks shows a majority in Parliament will do all it can to block it.No-deal is now no option and the prime minister must rule it out. If the government is defeated again next week in the meaningful vote on her deal, the question of EU membership has to be handed back to the people. The government will have failed and the 2016 mandate will have expired.The People’s Vote campaign has put out this statement about the result, from the Labour MP Ian Murray.The threat of a no deal Brexit has cynically used by the government for many months as part of their campaign to bully and intimidate parliament into voting for a bad deal that would leave us worse off and offers less control.Parliament has now asserted its authority and sovereignty and effectively exposed the threat of no deal as an empty one.The real choice facing parliament and the country is now clear. We can leave the EU under the terms of some version of the prime minister’s bad deal or we can keep all our rights, powers, influence and op-outs in our current deal as full members of the EU.Parliament remains gridlocked between these two choices, but, and as today has demonstrated, it can still act decisively. What it now must do is hand the decision back to the people.That’s all from me for tonight.My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is picking up the blog now.My colleague Polly Toynbee wonders whether Theresa May might secretly be relieved by that defeat.And here are the figures showing how MPs voted on amendment 7, party by party. I’ve taken then from the very useful CommonsVotes app.For the amendmentLabour: 229 (out of a potential 257 MPs)SNP: 35 (out of 35)Conservatives: 20 (out of 317)Lib Dems: 11 (out of 11)Plaid Cymru: 4 (out of 4)Independents: 3 (out of 7)Greens: 1 (out of 1)Against the amendmentConservatives: 282 (out of a potential 317 MPs)DUP: 10 (out of 10)Labour: 3 (out of 257)Independent: 1 (out of 7)You can find a full voting list here.And here are the three Labour MPs who voted with the government against amendment 7.Here is the full list of Conservative MP who voted for amendment 7 - the no-deal amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper.These are from the Times’ Henry Zeffman.After the vote Jesse Norman, a transport minister, rose on a point of order. Referring to Sir Vince Cable’s comment earlier about the possibility of part of the M3 being closed in the event of a no-deal Brexit (see 6.26pm), Norman said that Cable was wrong and that there were no plans to do this. The Tory MP Marcus Jones also rises to make a point of order. He says his name has been wrongly included on a letter signed by MPs who say they would vote against a no-deal Brexit.The result of the third vote in this group of amendments has been announced. It was on an amendment tabled by the Labour MP Chris Leslie, saying some powers in the finance bill should not be used without there being a vote in the Commons. It was defeated by 303 votes to 292 - a majority of 11."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da4cac23695b7fb6fa524d1721bd7aa4159e6964/96_0_2809_1686/master/2809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac46bcc3d11760894ccfa0d156904c1","title":"nasa spacecraft planet earth tess mission","story":"‘Super-Earth’ among trio of planets and six supernovae detected by Tess missionThree new planets and six supernovae outside our solar system have been observed by Nasa’s planet-hunting Tess mission in its first three months.Since it started surveying the sky in July, the MIT-led Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite project has identified Pi Mensae b, a “super-Earth” that travels around its star every six days, and LHS 3844b, a rocky world with an orbit of only 11 hours.The most recent discovery, an exoplanet named HD 21749b, has the longest orbital period at 36 days. It orbits a bright, nearby dwarf star about 53 light years away in the Reticulum constellation, and is thought to have a surface temperature of about 1,650C (3,000F). This is relatively cool considering its proximity to its star.Diana Dragomir, a Hubble fellow at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research who led the discovery team, said: “It’s the coolest planet we know of around a star this bright. It’s very hard to find small planets that orbit farther from their stars, and are therefore cooler. But here we were lucky, and can now study this one in more detail.”The new planet is 23 times the size of Earth, meaning it is likely to be gaseous rather than rocky, and it has an atmosphere more dense than Neptune or Uranus. Its discovery was announced by scientists at the annual American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle.The researchers have also detected evidence of another planet which, if confirmed, could be the first Earth-sized discovery by Tess.Tess monitors sections of the sky and waits for momentary dips in the light of about 200,000 nearby stars, likely to be a sign that a planet has passed in front of that star.Tess has also detected dozens of short-lived events, including images of six supernovae in distant galaxies that were later seen by ground-based telescopes.George Ricker, the mission’s principal investigator at MIT, predicted further discoveries: “We’re only halfway through Tess’s first year of operations and the data floodgates are just beginning to open.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939efec52f5338cfca1544b41f231c2ceb23884d/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3facd4da2ded71bb31b73f07bdcacaec","title":"oldham food bank launches fundraiser after burglary","story":"Cash donations, iPads and food stolen in raid at Trussell Trust-run premisesA fundraiser has been launched by Oldham food bank after a burglary in which items including cash donations, food and electronics used by volunteers were stolen.Tins of chocolates similar to those given out to vulnerable families in Greater Manchester over the Christmas period, jars of coffee, a password-protected hard drive containing clients’ data, iPads and £200 in cash donations were taken.A GoFundMe page has since been set up by one of the food bank’s volunteers to raise money to replace the stolen goods. In seven hours, over £1,400 has been raised through online donations – including from people as far away as Switzerland.David Jones, the co-manager of the Trussell Trust-run food bank, said: “I feel aggrieved that somebody targeted a charity, especially one that is part of the community. This is an Oldham charity – all the volunteers are from Oldham, doing this for Oldham people.”Two iPads that were stolen had been used to register people in need of fuel vouchers. Volunteers discovered the break-in, which happened over the weekend, on Monday. A window panel was taken out and a filing cabinet was destroyed in the raid, in which paperwork was thrown across the floor of the food bank’s office.Jones said: “It’s obviously not opportunistic. If somebody has a sense of injustice with us, this is not the way to demonstrate their feelings – there are other ways to do that.”All of the charity’s computers, including those that can be accessed by clients to sign up to universal credit, were left untouched. Another two iPads that were taken were being used to conduct a survey with the University of Edinburgh about the impact of food banks.Despite volunteers having to clear up after the raid, the food bank, which is closed between Saturday and Monday, opened as usual on Tuesday.On a normal day, volunteers give out food parcels, toiletries and clothing to between 10 and 20 clients. The Friday before Christmas, however, they gave out 74 food vouchers that can cater for whole families.Lisa Leunig, who co-manages the food bank, said: “I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve been here for seven years. When I spoke to our area manager they said if you want to close tomorrow it’s understandable. But we said they aren’t going to break us, they aren’t going to stop us.”Last August, £2,500 worth of sanitary items were stolen from a food bank in Salford, Greater Manchester.A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said: “Police were called shortly before 10.15am Monday 7 January to a report of a burglary at a premises on Manchester Street, Oldham.“An unknown offender entered the premises before stealing a quantity of cash. It is believed the burglary happened sometime between midday on Saturday 5 January and 9.50am on Monday 7 January. Inquiries are ongoing.”Oldham, which is one of the most deprived areas in the UK, was one of the initial pilot areas for the rollout of universal credit.Jones said: “Over the last 12 months we’ve seen a massive increase in the number of people we are supporting. It’s not just unemployed universal credit claimants – we’re seeing a lot more people who are in work.”A spokeswoman for Trussell Trust said that while the trust did see break-ins at its food banks from time to time, this was not a regular occurrence.She said: “Our area manager for the north-west is working closely with the food bank to support them as they respond to the break-in, and has reported that the level of support they’ve seen following the break-in has been huge. People across the community have really come together to help.“If people want to support the food bank we’d encourage them to donate financially if they can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b29f30689f5b28f01f59a06e486d9001da51146a/0_0_3747_2249/master/3747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e46cef5769c26a40c9e224c904435ca8","title":"what makes men send dick pics","story":"Four in 10 young women have reported being sent unsolicited explicit images. But what makes some men send photographs of their genitals to unsuspecting women – and is it time for a change in the law?When Leah Holroyd joined a dating site five years ago, the 31-year-old noticed a lot of men had listed The Great Gatsby as a favourite book. “So, to be slightly provocative, I mentioned in my profile that I thought it was overrated, and challenged someone to persuade me it was great,” she says. A postgraduate student in English literature sent her a message that read “a bit like literary criticism”, and they began exchanging messages and discussing their favourite books. Holroyd found him pleasant enough, but she was looking for a relationship rather than just friendship, and he only ever talked to her about authors.After a couple of weeks, the bibliophile said he would be visiting London where Holroyd, who builds online learning courses, was living. “He asked if I fancied meeting for coffee and a walk by the river,” she says. He suggested they swap phone numbers to make arrangements easier. “Almost instantly, he sent me closeups of his penis.”Laura Thompson, a researcher at City, University of London, whose work examines harassment over dating apps, says the issue has until now been trivialised. “The research in this area is really limited. I think this blind spot says something about how society and the law tends to think of the problem: that dick pics are an annoying internet phenomenon as opposed to ‘real’ flashing. The term ‘cyberflashing’ wasn’t even in widespread use until about a year or so ago. Research reflects the world we live in, and I just don’t think this problem has been taken seriously until relatively recently.”Yet the question that plagued me after hearing Holroyd’s story was: why? What happened in the mind of that man between talking about books, inviting a woman for coffee and a walk – and sending her a photograph of his penis? Unsurprisingly, I did not get very far by asking men in person if they had ever sent unsolicited photographs of their penis. So I set up an account on Reddit, where users can post anonymously in forums on a range of topics, and I asked the question again. Shortly afterwards, I went to the cinema. When I checked back a few hours later, I discovered more than 500 comments, and the moderators had shut the thread down.The comments were fascinating. The most important thing I learned is that sending pictures of one’s genitals has different meanings for different men – and different meanings for the same men at different points in their lives. Stephen Blumenthal, a consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst at the Portman – an NHS clinic that offers specialist long-term therapy to patients with disturbing sexual behaviours – says: “There’s always a tendency with these issues to provide one kind of formulation a one-size-fits-all explanation. But the reality is that there are many different motives that people have, some of which are perhaps more troubled and troubling than others.”Some who shared their experiences anonymously wrote about not feeling confident with their bodies, and wanting praise. One Reddit user, Jake, told me: “I’ve done it a few times in the past, and I think it’s mostly about validation. Although most men will never admit to it, we are very insecure about our bodies, especially down there. So, unconsciously, we just want someone to say we look nice, or that we are attractive. OK, sending an unsolicited dick pic is really not the way to do it, but I do think that’s the driver. We are just desperate for someone to tell us we’re OK. Not even sexy or incredibly handsome – just OK.”Others described wanting to turn up the sexual excitement in a messaging conversation they felt was flagging. Another user, Dave, wrote: “If the conversation had some potential, but was slowing down or becoming boring, I would sometimes send a dick pic. Because either they stop texting me or I get laid.” He added that “dick pics now only get sent upon request”.For others, it was “a numbers game”. For all the unsolicited pictures that were ignored or rebuffed, there was the occasional woman who responded in kind, and if one picture “worked”, it was worth it. Jake wrote: “When they were well-received, I felt good about it, from the validation and the boost to my self-image, but also the precedent it opened. It was now OK for them to reply in kind, or to steer the conversation down more sexual routes.”Another, John, estimated he has sent 100 unsolicited pictures in chatrooms over the years, after becoming aroused. “I’d see people chatting about various subjects. If they were remotely sexual, I think that served as my entry point to sending a pic,” he wrote. While he did have a couple of his “best pictures” saved on his phone, “the thrill of it was taking a pic in that moment and sending it … I think it may have been about creating or imagining some kind of sexual connection in that moment. The feeling was a bit of a rush in the anticipation of a response.”He described the four types of responses he received: very rarely, it would lead to an overtly sexual conversation in a chat window, in which further pictures might be exchanged or he might be sent a complimentary message or he might receive a negative, angry response. But, most often, he received no response.John is now in his 60s and has not sent a picture like this in more than a decade. He wrote: “As I have become older, frankly, it just seems a combination of rude, silly and empty. I have learned this is offensive and an unwanted intrusion, even if it is the internet and anonymous. Even online, it is a violation, in my opinion little different from the stereotypical street flasher in a trenchcoat. Really, those who send these unsolicited pics are essentially standing on a virtual street corner digitally flashing women they don’t know for their own sexual gratification.”I was intrigued by John’s condemnation, so I asked if he included himself among these online flashers. “Yes. The anonymity of the internet facilitates doing things online you’d never contemplate in the real world, so I think that helps men distance themselves from any consequences or impact on the person they send it to.”This notion makes a lot of sense to Blumenthal. “The internet has brought out all sorts of new varieties of unusual sexual proclivities that are related to previous versions, and might have some similar dynamics,” he says. Blumenthal believes there is a hidden narrative underneath some of these stories, which is what he has experienced with his patients who have committed indecent exposure: “Some will be trying to impress, whereas some will be seeking to intrude. And this intrusive aspect is an important one,” he says.“The guy on the train using AirDrop is flashing in the digital age. The flasher is looking for something very particular: he is interested in the response, focused on the faces of these women – he wants to see shock and surprise, and a kind of disabling of the person he is flashing.”In almost every case of real-world indecent exposure, he says, there will have been a childhood incident where the perpetrator endured a trauma that made him feel out of control. This is the notion of identification of the aggressor: determined never to be a victim again. As an adult, he unconsciously twists this act around so that, “he is now in the driving seat, watching the reaction of those he disturbs, inserting into his victim a feeling of shock, surprise, disturbance”.John says he has never heard about women being distressed by pictures sent by somebody they are already talking to online, describing them as “really more of an annoyance”. Perhaps some women do feel that, but others find them much more disturbing. When Holroyd received several explicit pictures from the man with whom she had just agreed to go for coffee and a walk, she tells me, “I felt totally shocked. Nothing in the conversation had made me think he was going to do that. I felt really worried because it seemed like a deception, I was confused, I didn’t know what he was really looking for, I didn’t feel safe.”When she replied to this man to say that she no longer wanted to meet him, she says, “he got really angry and aggressive. He told me that I must be mentally unstable because I had changed my mind so quickly. He said: ‘If you can just change your mind like that there’s something wrong with you.’ And he told me I should get professional help. He put the blame on me made me feel I had done something wrong and had been unfair to him.”In expressing his rage towards Holroyd, he was also describing exactly how he had made Holroyd feel about him: he was the one whose behaviour had been unstable, unpredictable, disturbed and disturbing. He had projected his feelings directly on to her.Some men said they had stopped sending unsolicited photographs after a negative response. Another Reddit user, Jeremy, wrote about the one occasion he sent a photograph to a girl he had been messaging on Tinder: “She replied with: ‘Ew!’ and blocked me. Rightly so. Haven’t done it since.”Others replied that leaving it up to women to teach men what is acceptable by responding negatively could put those women at risk.Blumenthal says that it is crucial to distinguish between noncontact offences, in which the perpetrator does not touch his or her victim, and contact offences – and that the overlap between those who commit indecent exposure and those who go on to sexually assault their victims, is low. Yet the term “noncontact offence” in this context, is an interesting one – it almost feels inaccurate: while sending an unsolicited photograph does not involve physical contact, it can feel like a violation an assault.Cyberflashing can be prosecuted under a number of different laws, which carry prison sentences of up to two years. But there are problems with these laws, says barrister Kate Parker, director of the UK-based Schools Consent Project, a charity she founded to educate young people about consent and sexual assault. A prosecution would need to prove that the sender’s purpose was either to cause distress or anxiety, or that the image was “grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character”.Parker says: “In an era where sending dick pics is becoming increasingly normalised, the depressing reality is that such intent might not be proven. Some men think it is an appropriate way to start a conversation, or take an existing conversation to a more ‘flirty’ level.” And when it comes to the notion of indecency, the threshold is increasingly high: “as our online and offline worlds are increasingly saturated with sexual imagery, it may be that society’s collective perception of sexual indecency begins to shift”. She supports the creation of a new law – one “that finally includes a consideration of the recipient’s – typically a woman – response to such messages as a determinant of criminal liability”.We can improve the law, criminalising this latest incarnation of flashing, but, unless we try to understand the motivations behind it, we have no hope of stopping it. When I was a schoolgirl, a man flashed me as I walked home from the local park – he ran ahead of me then stood masturbating, with his T-shirt over his face. When I was 17, on holiday in Paris with my best friend, a man thrust a photograph of a deformed penis in our faces. When I was in my 20s, a man I was flirting with texted me an unexpected dick pic. All these experiences, shifting in format, but not in nature, as technology progressed, were shocking, and unpleasant.

He has not played since and is continuing to show symptoms such as headaches.“Leigh has seen the specialist and he will not be used for the next three to five weeks,” said Wayne Pivac, the Scarlets’ coach. “He will continue doing what he has been doing, such as running, and will then be reassessed.Halfpenny was injured when the Australia centre Samu Kerevi clattered into him having failed to charge down the full-back’s clearance. Wales were angry when no action was taken against the Wallaby, a feeling that has not softened with the player set to miss three months of the season at least.Pivac is confident the 30-year old will resume his career. “He has been having bouts of headaches. He is frustrated but his health and wellbeing come first. A number of players have come back from concussion before and there is no reason why it will not happen with Leigh.”Pivac was speaking on the day when the 27-year-old Ospreys centre Ben John retired, having taken a 12-month break following a succession of head injuries.“It has taken so long for me to recover the only decision for me was to retire,” said John, who has started a new career as a personal trainer in London. “Rugby has been my life but my long-term health is more important.”Gatland names his squad for the Six Nations on Tuesday. Already without the flankers Ellis Jenkins and Aaron Shingler, he has other concerns in the back row, with James Davies, Taulupe Faletau, Ross Moriarty and Dan Lydiate all injured.Rhys Priestland will leave Bath at the end of the season after a four-year stint at the Recreation Ground. The 31-year-old fly-half, who joined from the Scarlets, has 50 caps and last played for Wales in 2017.“Rhys has been an influential figure not only on the field but in his leadership off the field,” the Bath rugby director, Todd Blackadder, said. “There is still a lot of rugby to play between now and the end of the season, and I have no doubt he will play a key role in the next six months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a398755cdb92727cfb1f38f2b045039f64639551/0_232_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab9041e71ab5580f532ecc94fc9a5a91","title":"padraig harrington ryder cup captain golf whistling straits 2020","story":"It was a case of when, not if, Padraig Harrington would enjoy a Ryder Cup captaincy coronation in the minds of everyone but the man himself. Harrington admitted upon his unveiling as Europe’s leader for 2020 at Whistling Straits that the thought of failure left him with a sense of trepidation to the point where accepting the European Tour’s overtures was far from the formality the rest of us assumed. This proved an endearing nod towards the self-doubt which consumes even – or perhaps more so – sportspeople at the highest level.Harrington raised a smile when contemplating how his fellow Irishman Paul McGinley has made all subsequent captains work harder given how he prepared for 2014 at Gleneagles. “Everything was lining up,” Harrington explained. “But I had to be confident that I wanted to do it.“I didn’t want to walk into this and be halfway through going: ‘I don’t know about this.’ It’s a job – and I have to blame McGinley, not thank him – that you have to be committed to. It is a two-year job, 20-month job and I had to sit down and say: ‘Am I prepared to do this?’ If it ever was, this is no longer a jolly.”There then followed what will widely be interpreted as a dig at Nick Faldo, a decorated player but hapless captain of Europe in 2008. “We have seen once or twice in the past, once, anyway, where your captain has done a half-hearted job and it doesn’t end well,” Harrington said. “I’m good at hitting a little white golf ball. Does that mean I’m good at managing? I had to ask myself these questions, am I prepared to do this, and I was. That’s basically it.“I love playing golf, I really do. I enjoy it. This is what I love doing, is playing golf, but I’m prepared to put my golfing legacy on the line here. I could easily have just walked away from this and said: ‘Oh, it’s not for me, I’ve had a successful golf career.’“I don’t want to be a winning captain at all costs but I want to be a winning captain. These are the things that you have to sit down and think: ‘Can I do the job.’”In truth, it seems fanciful to suggest Harrington’s standing within the game – having won 30 tournaments worldwide, including three major championships – would be seriously diminished in defeat next year. The 47-year-old conceded Whistling Straits itself, semi-European in style, formed part of his thought process for a biennial event which has become home-team dominated in recent times.“You could be a great captain and lose and people will find fault in it. You could be a poor captain and win and people will think you did a great job. So I have to get over that.Harrington suggested he will cut by one the four wildcard selections utilised by Thomas Bjørn before success at Le Golf National last year. The double Open champion also issued a staunch and timely defence of Rory McIlroy, who was criticised for branding the European Tour a “stepping stone” before kicking off his season in Hawaii last weekend. Harrington has no doubts whatsoever regarding the Northern Irishman’s commitment to his home continent.“I can only look at his actions,” Harrington said. “That man loves the Ryder Cup. He has become a leader in the team room. He gives so much to the Ryder Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce79692040fb7d88a93193a26b1c0abd4740f721/0_353_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e6a332db39d453a4c4e5cb8e8445a0","title":"paradise review dusty hughes sara kestelman hampstead theatre downstairs","story":"Hampstead Downstairs, LondonDusty Hughes’s play about two mischief-making seniors living in a retirement home is stoic about ageingGiven that nearly a fifth of the UK population is aged 65 or over, I suspect there will be a growing appetite for plays about old age. Alan Bennett in Allelujah! and Florian Zeller in The Height of the Storm have recently tackled the subject and now Dusty Hughes, in his first stage piece since 2000, has come up with a quietly touching summer-garden play about the penalties, and occasional pleasures, of growing old. But I suspect I shall remember the piece mainly for the performance of the ever-astonishing Sara Kestelman.She plays a green-fingered oldster called Goose and Geoffrey Freshwater an elderly gay man named Meakin: both are residents of a private retirement home and, having known each other since schooldays, exist in a state of friendly antagonism. But their chief delight lies in mocking, and shocking, their unseen co-retirees: he, in particular, loves to leave soft-porn magazines in the dining room. But the play’s only real crisis erupts when Goose is threatened with eviction by the home’s new manager over her inability to pay her bills: a situation that Meakin, who has accumulated a small fortune after living for 40 years with a famous artist, does little to alleviate.Not a lot happens in terms of plot. You often feel, especially when a sympathetic maid talks about her dead boyfriend and anarchic gran, that Hughes is marking time.His achievement lies in capturing the querulous co-dependence of the odd couple at the heart of his play and the mix of desperation and lack of inhibition that is part of old age. Meakin, looking back on his privileged past, says that he now feels: “Like a castle sacked by barbarians.” But he and Goose feel free to drink gin mid-afternoon, bitch about their contemporaries and split hairs about the sex lives of spiders.In Kestelman’s performance, however, it is Goose who emerges as the more complex character. We learn that she was a history teacher, that her savings were frittered away by her daughter and that she is still suffering the after-effects of a stroke. Kestelman conveys the humiliations of her condition such as being asked, after a memory loss, to name the current prime minister. But when she says that all the people she once was are still inside her, you grasp the compensations of age. Seeking affirmation from Meakin of his unspoken love for her, Kestelman cries “Lie to me” with an urgency that stirs the blood. With her close-knit helmet of white hair and rigorously attentive eyes, Kestelman gives a performance you won’t quickly forget.Freshwater captures well the rumbustious selfishness and capricious mischief of the misanthropic Meakin. Claire Lams as the home’s brisk new boss redeems an initially frosty character by suggesting it is no picnic coping with the wayward old and Rebekah Hinds reveals the compassion of the gossipy maid. Alice Hamilton, who directed Barney Norris’s Visitors, also confirms that she has a special gift for dealing with plays about senior citizens. Although the play has affinities with David Storey’s Home, it lacks that work’s visual and verbal poetry. What it does do, in its modest, slow-burning way, is remind us that it is perfectly possible to confront the privations of age with a stoic fortitude."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9859d400f41723dba49da8690a02b3506a1eb09/0_199_5384_3229/master/5384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afe786d78ee23acab41a6be8b6c551e0","title":"school bus leeds cultural community college slung low","story":"Arts education is in crisis but theatre company Slung Low has set up a pay-what-you-can community college, offering lessons in art activism, wood-whittling and much moreOn board a double-decker in Holbeck, a small revolution in cultural education is brewing. In this corner of Leeds, locals are learning for the love of it on a bus that has been converted into classrooms. Inspired by the education programmes that used to be run by the Women’s Institute and working men’s clubs, the Cultural Community College offers classes free at the point of use, without any obvious instrumental purpose – a gesture that is, in the current climate, quietly radical.The college is the brainchild of theatre company Slung Low and was born out of the company’s own experience of learning new skills while making Flood, a large-scale series of works for Hull city of culture 2017. “What we found is that when we learned stuff - no matter what it was - we were generally more confident about everything,” says artistic director Alan Lane. And so the company wondered if they could pass that confidence on to others.“We had this idea that we could open a college that would not be in any way useful for anyone’s occupation,” Lane explains. “That it would operate beyond the market, that it would be ‘pay what you decide’, and that we would teach as broad a cultural offer – from stargazing to blacksmithing and everything in between – as we could possibly finance.”And that’s just what the company has done. In its first term, the Cultural Community College has taught Holbeck residents how to make everything from vegetarian Indian food to furniture to documentary films. There have been courses on art as activism and CPR, as well as the stargazing and blacksmithing.People might wonder what a theatre company is doing setting up a college. For Lane, the answer is simple: “It’s the most useful thing we could do.” He adds: “We’ve never had a programme which has been so well received by the theatre industry. The college has really struck a chord.” The first courses were fully booked online within 48 hours, and Slung Low has been inundated with offers from artists who want to share their expertise.Over time, the idea is that the college’s members take ownership of the curriculum, with courses selected through a dialogue between Slung Low and the community. “It’s not pure cultural democracy,” says Lane, “but it’s definitely true that there are subjects and classes that people will be able to point to and say, ‘I told them to do that.’”It’s no coincidence that the Cultural Community College has appeared at a time when arts education is perceived to be in crisis. The exclusion of arts subjects from the English baccalaureate has led to a decline in their study at many schools, while the emphasis on so-called “facilitating subjects” has discouraged students from choosing arts A-level options. In his new book The British Betrayal of Childhood, former children’s commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley-Green even includes the downgrading of arts education as one of the factors driving a “crisis in childhood”.Lane and his team were certainly conscious of the challenges currently facing arts education, but the Cultural Community College has an offer that’s distinct from the instruction provided by schools, universities and the education departments of theatres. Slung Low want to bring in people who may be put off by traditional learning environments, and so they’ve been thinking carefully about how and where their courses take place – hence the bus, aboard which some of the lessons are taught, as well as at Slung Low’s Hub HQ under the viaducts of Holbeck Junction.Lane is reluctant to describe the course instructors as teachers instead he calls them talkers, or experts. “There is a failure of imagination going on at every possible level of society,” Lane suggests, “and that’s starting with children in schools, where we have decided that to learn to remember things is more important than to imagine things.” He adds that “the college is a kind of response to that failure of imagination, but it’s also very aware of not trying to replicate an arts education”.Unlike many of those fighting for arts education – including the signatories of a letter to the  last year expressing “grave concern” about the exclusion of the arts in schools – Lane does not fall back on the economic argument. For him, and for Slung Low, cultural learning is about confidence, citizenship and empathy. The real question is not what arts education can do for the nation’s finances, but what it can do for people and communities. “Does it make better citizens, and does that have any impact on all our lives?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55578bd08a869ae108a231cf7dde468b897c409b/0_225_4444_2667/master/4444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f51b1d457c69d41915e68836b7d376b2","title":"us government shutdown 2019 explained","story":"Stretching into a third week, the shutdown is now the second-longest in US history, as Trump demands funding for border wallA partial shutdown of the US federal government has stretched into a third week with virtually no end in sight. It is now the second-longest shutdown in US history. The closures are having an impact on 800,000 federal workers, many of whom will not receive paychecks for the first time since the standoff in Washington began just before Christmas.Standing in the way of a resolution is Donald Trump’s demand for a wall on the US-Mexico border – a central promise of his presidential campaign. Despite repeatedly vowing that Mexico would pay for it, the president is now demanding $5.7bn in taxpayer money to proceed with construction of the border wall. Democrats are standing firm against the proposal while Trump has threatened that the shutdown, which he already said he would be proud to take responsibility for, could last for “months or even years”.During a government shutdown, federal agencies must cease all operations and services deemed non-essential while essential functions such as airport security and law enforcement will continue to be performed. Laid-off workers are sent home without pay while other employees must work without being paid.The shutdown lasts until new funding is approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.On 21 December at midnight, funding expired and work ceased across nine federal departments. Many national parks are closed, immigration courts were suspended and scientific research has stalled. The sprawling federal bureaucracy that keeps many aspects of American life humming is funded by an annual budget set and approved by Congress. The president must sign – or veto – the 12 so-called appropriations bills, which lay out how federal agencies may spend their money in the next fiscal year.Appropriations bills need 60 votes in the Senate, a requirement that often forces bipartisanship depending on the party breakdown in the chamber. When Congress fails to pass – or the president refuses to sign – budget legislation before a spending deadline, whatever portion of government lacks funding “shuts down”.This process has becoming increasingly political in recent years and has been used by both parties as a way to extract concessions on legislative priorities.In October 2013, Republicans shut down the government for 16 days in an unsuccessful bid to strip funding from Barack Obama’s healthcare legislation, the Affordable Care Act. In January 2018, Democrats briefly shut down the government over an impasse on immigration legislation, as a way to demand Congress enact protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children.If the shutdown continues through the weekend, it will be the longest on record. The White House on Monday directed the Internal Revenue Service to pay tax refunds.The impact of the shutdown will only worsen the longer it lasts. The nation’s food assistance program only has funding through the end of January and it probably could not meet the demand expected in February. Meanwhile, federal workers appear to be growing frustrated. Transportation Security Administration employees have been increasingly calling out sick at airports across the country while at the Environmental Protection Agency are planning a “national sick day” to protest against the shutdown.An impasse between a ided Congress and the White House is to blame. Trump’s demand for a wall is the key sticking point. Public polling suggests that Americans believe Republicans, and specifically the president, are to blame for the shutdown. Meanwhile, a majority of Americans oppose the wall, while a larger share say it should not be the priority. In December, Trump said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for shutting down the government in the face of Democratic opposition to funding his pet wall project.Negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House are at a virtual standstill. That’s despite tense meetings and the president spending the Christmas and New Year break at the White House instead of going to his club, Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, alternating between threats and pleadings to Democrats via Twitter.As the repercussions of the shutdown further ripple across the country, members of Congress – including a small but vocal group of Republicans – are demanding the Senate take up legislation to end the shutdown and allow the debate over border security to resume with the government opens.Trump on Tuesday was set to address the nation to possibly declare a “national emergency” that would allow him to build a wall without congressional approval, a move fraught with legal obstacles and political peril. Alternatively, he may merely declare a “crisis” and continue his political arguments for an agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a075f2f19ccb1cd28530ab02fc72f3fbe5ac7352/0_225_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d1df2243db0e6b580cc14f43213e1b","title":"erdogan us bolton turkey syria withdrawal kurdish","story":"US security chief tempers withdrawal claims, jeopardising Turkey’s plans to target Kurdish groupsTurkey has asked Washington to hand over its bases in Syria as the Trump administration appeared to reverse plans to withdraw from the country’s north-east on Tuesday, jeopardising Ankara’s plans to launch a widespread military operation targeting Kurdish groups.The fresh row between the two Nato allies broke out as the US national security adviser, John Bolton, visited Ankara to row back on a surprise announcement by Donald Trump in December that US forces would leave Syria imminently, abandoning Kurdish proxies who had led its ground war against the Islamic State terror group. Turkey views those same Kurdish groups as mortal foes.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in a scathing speech to parliament delivered while Bolton was still in the Turkish capital, said the US envoy had “made a serious mistake” and that Turkey would never agree to a compromise that protected the Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, whose members helped a US-led coalition push Isis out of most of Syria’s east.“Elements of the US administration are saying different things,” said Erdoğan. “The YPG and the PKK can never be representatives of the Kurdish people.”Erdoğan, signalling the rift, refused to meet Bolton, leaving the US national security adviser to instead hold talks with his Turkish counterpart, Ibrahim Kalin, and other officials at Ankara’s presidency complex.The Turkish leader said Turkey’s armed forces had finished preparations to enter Syria and that Washington was stalling on a commitment to leave the town of Manbij as a first step.Bolton, before arriving in Ankara, had directly contradicted the US president, claiming Washington would not leave Syria without first receiving guarantees that Turkey would not attack its allies.Trump later claimed this was “no different from my original statements”, but said the US would leave “at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!”Bolton’s added condition came amid a furore over Trump’s claims that Isis had been defeated and his apparent disregard for the fate of Kurdish forces recruited for the cause, whom Ankara had never accepted as legitimate allies.Erdoğan on Tuesday repeated his insistence that there was no distinction between the YPG in Syria and the PKK in Turkey, with whom Ankara has fought a four-decade civil war.Throughout the Syrian war, and in particular since the US partnered with the Kurds in 2014, Turkey has been deeply wary of Kurdish postwar ambitions, and what they might mean for the 500-mile border it shares with its southern neighbour.An emboldened Kurdish cause has been a nightmare scenario for Turkish officials, whose crackdown on the Kurds inside Syria intensified 11 months ago, when the country’s military invaded an enclave in Syria’s north-west, ousting the YPG from the town of Afrin.A schism between Turkey and the US over the fate of north-eastern Syria had grown since the Afrin operation, which also sparked tensions between Washington and its Kurdish-led anti-Isis force, which had implored its sponsor to defend it from the Turkish incursion.Since then, the Isis fight has slowed and there have been fears that it might stop altogether, just as the terror group faces a military defeat in the last slithers of lands it holds along the Iraqi-Syrian border.Regional security officials say as many as 5,000 diehard Isis members remain in the area, with potentially more having abandoned their weapons and filtered back into towns and villages on both sides of the border, where they have been biding their time. The group has retained significant firepower on Saturday, Isis members fired a guided missile at a Kurdish position, seriously wounding two British special forces members who were assisting the local fighters.Britain and France, with growing uncertainty over US plans, had stepped up engagement with Kurdish forces with whom they too have partnered against Isis in Syria’s eastern deserts over the past four years.Bolton was on Tuesday joined in the region by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, whose arrival appeared to be part of a rearguard to assure the Kurds and other allies that the US was not abandoning its stated strategies of defeating Isis and curbing Iranian influence. Both Bolton and Pompeo are Iran hawks and their oft-stated goals had been thrown into confusion after Trump’s December announcement.Pompeo, on route to the region, said: “The counter-Isis campaign continues, the effort – the counter-Iran campaign absolutely continues, and our commitment to support Middle East stability is still full throttle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25b4b6754a0f14314d43020853d3a5eac524a48/0_0_5967_3579/master/5967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4589db558c565cff129ce535e38ea7e","title":"iran behind two assassinations in netherlands minister","story":"Foreign minister says there is ‘strong’ evidence Iran directed killings of two Dutch nationalsIran has been accused by the Dutch government of directing two political assassinations in the Netherlands, triggering EU sanctions against Tehran’s military intelligence service.The two murders are alleged to have taken place in broad daylight in 2015 in Almere, a city east of Amsterdam, and in 2017 on a street close to the Dutch foreign ministry in The Hague.In a written statement to the Dutch parliament, Stef Blok, the country’s foreign minister, said intelligence services had found “strong indications that Iran was involved in the assassinations of two Dutch nationals of Iranian origin”.Blok added the government believed such “hostile actions” violated Dutch sovereignty.The man killed in 2015 was named as Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi, 56, who had previously been sentenced to death in Iran after being accused of planting a bomb at the Islamic Republic party’s headquarters in 1981, killing 73 people.Among those killed in the bomb attack was the second-in-command to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader. Samadi, who had been in the building shortly before the explosion, was accused of the attack and fled to Europe. He was sentenced to death in absentia.With his wife and teenage son, he had lived in Almere, working as an engineer under the alias Ali Motamed. He was shot in the head at point-blank range by two assailants dressed in black, in what was claimed to have the hallmarks of a contract killing.Two years later, the Iranian activist Ahmad Molla Nissi, 52, who founded an Arab nationalist group seeking an independent state inside Iran, was also shot in the head as he walked through The Hague.On Tuesday, the EU imposed sanctions against two Iranians and the country’s military intelligence service in response to the allegations.The Dutch government said the expulsion in June 2018 of two diplomats from the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands had been in retaliation for the murders and the Iranian ambassador had been summoned at the time.Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said it was involved in “intense” efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian “interference” in Europe. Last year, France and Denmark also accused Iran of plotting attacks on European soil, involving a foiled bombing attack that targeted a rally organised by an Iranian opposition group near Paris in June 2018 and the assassination of the exiled leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA), a separatist group with a history of carrying out attacks in Iran.The development has thrown EU-Iran relations into crisis at a time when Brussels is straining to keep alive the accord under which sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for it lowering its nuclear ambitions. Last year, the US president, Donald Trump, pulled out of the agreement, describing it as a “rotten deal”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1362a73daa1cd2ebfae3032bb40b3ce20d2c0b/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a06aaa76893672f30e0220e8c04d0","title":"what does 2019 hold for kim jong un and north korea podcast","story":"Kim Jong-un goes into 2019 with momentum to build on after last year’s historic meeting with President Donald Trump.

File image: Bryan O’BrienNurses are planning to stage six strikes over pay in the weeks ahead. Members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) are to hold a 24-hour work stoppage on January 30th. The union said on Tuesday that five other 24-hour strikes would take place in February if the dispute was not resolved.It has scheduled strikes for February 5th, 7th, 12th, 13th and 14th. The INMO said on strike days members would withdraw labour but life-saving and emergency care would be provided. The decision to strike follows an overwhelming vote in favour of strike action by union members before Christmas in support of their pay claim.The union said the HSE could not recruit and retain sufficient staff on current wage rates. INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said going on strike was the last thing nurses and midwives wanted to do. However, she said the crisis in recruiting and retention made it impossible for nurses and midwives to do their jobs properly. “We are not able to give patients the care they deserve under these conditions.”She said the planned strikes could be averted but the ball was in the Government’s court.“All it takes is for the Government to acknowledge our concerns, engage with us directly and work to resolve this issue in a pro-active manner.”The INMO is seeking across-the-board rises of about 12 per cent to bring pay for nurses into line with grades such as physiotherapists as a means of tackling recruitment and retention problems. The Minister for Health, Simon Harris said the planned strike action by nurses was unwarranted and could be avoided. He said the Department of Health and the HSE would invite the INMO to talks next week. There was “a clear need for engagement” and it was essential that the time available was used by all sides to find a resolution to this dispute, Mr Harris said.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has already said the Government would not reopen the pay agreement it has with all public servants to give a special deal to the nurses.Mr Varadkar has also warned that a strike will result in the cancellation of patient appointments and surgeries, even though doctors are not involved.The executive of the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) is expected to set out its plans for strike action when it meets on Thursday.Members of INMO and PNA voted in favour of strike action before Christmas after rejecting a €20 million package of proposals put forward by the Government to address recruitment and retention problems."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute describe scene of Ardee murder as \u0026ldquogruesome but say \u0026ldquowe\u0026rsquore not looking for anybody elseMayor briefly hands over the reins as festival marking year of the pig beginsMichael Kingston\u0026rsquos father died when French oil tanker caught fire in Bantry in 1979Hundreds, including teachers, BT staff, past winners and students, play their vital partsFurther test results awaited to establish cause of death of woman who may be ItalianAction taken against An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela over two proposed cycling and pedestrian bridgesCity council plans \u0026euro12m water sports facility for George\u0026rsquos DockFurther five dates for strike action in February planned if dispute over pay not resolvedPersonal injury action against State taken by widow and children of officer shot on dutyDig comes after letter claimed to know exact location of remains of Dr Deirdre O\u0026rsquoFlaherty who vanished in DonegalBlockage consists of 64m-long accumulation of household waste thrown down toiletsCooked chicken found in cardboard boxes previously used for raw chicken in Co Meath outletDeirdre Hogan says she was whistleblower who later had to resign from Nursing and Midwifery BoardVehicles taken by garda\u0026iacute under new legislation which came into force before ChristmasFormer sports coach accused of acts against three boys in 1980s is remanded in custodyGarda\u0026iacute say file will be prepared for Director of Public Prosecutions.If such a request is made \u0026lsquoand is justified\u0026rsquo Ireland will not stand in the way, says MinisterCork, Letterkenny and Limerick hospitals worst affected as Harris says flu is a factor"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The final sums paid out of taxpayers\u0027 pockets to Leigh Day in costs alone are expected to top £20 million. The MoD has already made payments of £20m in damages to Iraqi victims while the final bill is likely to be millions more.During an uncomfortable two-hour question and answer session, Mr Day admitted that he had never visited Iraq, and that of his firm’s 500 staff only one member had ever travelled to the country, and on only one occasion.Asked by Conservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer if he believed that the generation of British soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan had such a problem with values and standards that the idea of them executing Iraqi soldiers was a genuine possibility, Mr Day replied: Yes.Mr Mercer later described Mr Day as “absolutely deluded.”Conservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer raised concerns Another Conservative MP, Mark Francois, said he didn’t know how Mr Day could sleep at night after the solicitor said that he had never met any of the veterans that the MP said his company has persecuted.Mr Day’s legal firm, based in Clerkenwell, London, has issued 967 claims against the MoD on behalf of Iraqi citizens alleging unlawful detention, mistreatment and in some cases unlawful killings.Speaking today, Mr Day said that of the first 350 cases that they had reviewed with the MoD, 20 had not progressed and 330 of those claims had succeeded and the claimants were awarded compensation.“We’ve got about 625 left that we are in the process of reviewing now, and I would have thought that something like 150 of that 625 will not be progressed,” he added.Veterans and their families have condemned the investigations into historic allegations in Iraq which have been widely branded a “witch-hunt”.As well as the civil cases pursued by Leigh Day, veterans have faced criminal investigations over Iraq. Cases were brought by disgraced human rights lawyer Phil Shiner, who represented Iraqi clients some of whose claims of abuse were later found to be deliberate lies. Mr Shiner was struck off for dishonesty after being found guilty of a series of allegations of professional misconduct. A series of criminal inquiries into hundreds of British troops in Iraq was closed down.Veterans of the Troubles in Northern Ireland are currently under fresh criminal investigations for alleged wrongful killings often dating back more than 40 years.The Government has consulted on new mechanisms to protect veterans from investigations into past killings.Last year, more than 30 Tory MPs supported a backbench proposal for a 20-year time limit on reopening cases involving former members of the armed forces who served in Northern Ireland.Asked whether he thought a statute of limitations would be appropriate, Mr Day said it may be - but only for minor offences. Mr Day told MPs that Germany has a statute of limitations system that ties into lower grade injury and assaults, which he said seemed like a very good idea.I think there is a massive difference between very severe torture and abuse as against lower grade things, he explained.What I felt was, when it comes to murder, when it comes to alleged murder, when it comes to the most serious of damage, then I think it is very difficult to say that soldiers should be treated any differently to any other people within society.Ministry of DefenceVote victory gives \u0026#39guerrilla war\u0026#39 Tory rebels first blood in battle to stop a no-deal BrexitManhunt, episode 3 review: a respectful act of bearing witness to a terrible evilIcons: Leaders, review: Churchill vs Mandela in X Factor-style vote?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means.

Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

The prime minister’s deal was “far from perfect” but had been supported by London First as the only option for businesses desperate to avoid crashing out of the EU on 29 March.£800bn of assets moves from London to EU financial hubs before BrexitThe Independent, along with the People’s Vote campaign, has backed a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal.London First chief executive Jasmine Whitbread said the country is now “teetering on a cliff edge”.She said: “Time has run out and continuing to head towards a no deal is irresponsible, irrational and risks further damage to jobs and growth.“If we don’t have a deal next week, it’s time to stop the clock and revoke Article 50, so the Government can stop spending billions on last-ditch efforts to manage a no deal and instead come up with a plan that works.“If such a plan cannot be found, the decision must go back to the people.

Credit card debt was at £72.5bn, or £2,688 per household.“The government is skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth,” Ms O’Grady said. “A strong economy needs people spending wages, not credit cards and loans.Credit card debt hits £72.5bn despite fears for UK economy’s future“Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers. Trade unions should be allowed the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate higher wages.”Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,\u0026nbspsaid student loan debt is a “different animal” from credit card debt, for example, because borrowers don’t pay money back unless they are earning over £21,000.\u0026nbsp“This prevents the most extreme outcomes,” he said.“In aggregate, consumer debt as a whole is below the level it was in 2008, although that is hardly a comfort and means there is still vulnerability.”Mr Kara also pointed to concerns around the\u0026nbsplow level of saving by households. “If there is some kind of trigger or\u0026nbspflare-up – most obviously a rise in interest rates or unemployment – that could have a negative effect on the economy.”A sharp rise in interest rates could have a “material impact” on economic growth which, at 1.4 per cent, is already comparatively low, Mr Kara said.On the positive side, he said\u0026nbspthe Bank of England’s stress tests demonstrate that lenders are in a better financial position than they were before the financial crisis, with more capital to act as a buffer in the event of a shock.However, the central bank has much less room to manoeuvre than it did in 2008. Faced with a\u0026nbspdownturn the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would typically lower interest rates, making debt cheaper and fuelling a recovery. But rates are already close to all-time lows.On the other hand, if inflation were to rise the bank would typically raise interest rates to cool demand and rein in price increases.Perhaps the most likely trigger for rising inflation in the near future is a potential fall in the value of the pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWhile governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that rate rises could occur if the UK crashes out of the EU, the MPC would likely be reluctant to raise its benchmark too far or too fast for fear of damaging an already fragile economy at a time of upheaval.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.Beijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticise his tactics but echo US\u0026nbspcomplaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\u0026nbspThe European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organisation in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\u0026nbspFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with US\u0026nbspcurbs on exports of “dual use” technology with possible military applications. They complain China\u0027s companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\u0026nbspSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump\u0027s tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him.

The prime minister’s deal was “far from perfect” but had been supported by London First as the only option for businesses desperate to avoid crashing out of the EU on 29 March.£800bn of assets moves from London to EU financial hubs before BrexitThe Independent, along with the People’s Vote campaign, has backed a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal.London First chief executive Jasmine Whitbread said the country is now “teetering on a cliff edge”.She said: “Time has run out and continuing to head towards a no deal is irresponsible, irrational and risks further damage to jobs and growth.“If we don’t have a deal next week, it’s time to stop the clock and revoke Article 50, so the Government can stop spending billions on last-ditch efforts to manage a no deal and instead come up with a plan that works.“If such a plan cannot be found, the decision must go back to the people. Continued uncertainty is never welcome, but it will be vastly less damaging than crashing out of the EU.”Research commissioned by London First suggests that just 41 per cent\u0026nbspof businesses feel they’ve been able to plan effectively for Brexit.The group argues that falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would mean “huge practical and logistical problems” for UK companies.The latest bad news for the government’s Brexit plans came as preparations for no deal descended into farce this week as dozens of lorries occupied a disused airfield in Kent in a “live test” of how ministers plan to ease congestion on roads to Channel ports.The Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed that just 89 drivers, each paid £550 to take part in the test, showed up out of an expected 150.Former Conservative chairman\u0026nbspLord Patten said the exercise\u0026nbspwas “enough to make one weep”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But here we were lucky, and caught this one, and can now study it in more detail.”Even despite being called small by the scientists who found it, the world is still huge compared to us: it is about three times our size, and\u0026nbsp23 times as massive. That puts it in the category of a sub-Neptune, and means that it would be the first roughly Earth-sized planets to have been found by TESS.But it is unlikely to look much like our own planet. It\u0027s probably made of gas like Neptune or Uranus, though something far more dense than their atmospheres.“We think this planet wouldn’t be as gaseous as Neptune or Uranus, which are mostly hydrogen and really puffy,” Dragomir says. “The planet likely has a density of water, or a thick atmosphere.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A gargantuan fatberg 64 metres long has been discovered blocking a sewer running along the seafront in Sidmouth.The huge mass, roughly the size of six double-decker buses, is made up of a conglomeration of congealed grease and oil, and is brimming with food waste, wet wipes, nappies, condoms and other refuse. It is expected to take two months to remove, according to South West Water, who said it was the largest they had ever come across.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSWW’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said: “It shows how this key environmental issue is not just facing the UK’s cities, but right here in our coastal towns.‘Repulsive’ fatberg to be displayed at the Museum of LondonTrump is the political equivalent of a fatberg, says Naomi KleinSewer rat emerges from 130-tonne ‘fatberg’ in east London“It is the largest discovered in our service history and will take our sewer team around eight weeks to dissect this monster in exceptionally challenging work conditions.”Sidmouth Town councillor Paul Wright told The Independent: “We’re quite surprised by the sheer size of the thing. I thought I misheard last night when I heard the size, but it’s 60-plus\u0026nbspmetres. “The question that sprung to my mind was when did they last check the sewers? It hasn’t grown overnight. It could be absolutely ancient. It could be the oldest fatberg as well as being so long. It’s quite incredible.”South West Water has assured the public the discovery poses no health risk to swimmers in the seaside town, and work to remove the blockage is due to start on 4 February.One local woman who did not want to be named told The Independent: “I haven’t seen it, or been down there. This is not Sidmouth’s idea of fun.” Sidmouth’s discovery is however not the largest fatberg ever found in the UK. In 2017, a titanic 250-metre-long fatberg was revealed to have been spawned in sewers beneath Whitechapel, in east London.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alex Salmond speaking outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh after it ruled that the Scottish Government acted unlawfully regarding sexual harassment complaints against the former first ministerBritain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May meets with a mother and baby during a visit to a facility within Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool.

But with the Brexit process having descended into chaos, the prospect of an extension to the period is now being talked about, including among ministers and UK officials.How can\u0026nbspArticle 50 be extended?An extension of Article 50 would require two things: firstly, the UK would have to ask for one. Secondly, the other 27 EU countries would have to unanimously agree to it.There is no formal limit on the deadline extension, though the EU has previously suggested that it would not grant an indefinite prolongation.How is this relevant to a second referendum?Brexiteer MP walks through pro-EU protest with GoPro to document abuseBrexit secretary ‘has not discussed’ delaying UK’s EU withdrawalFury as Brexit secretary suggests no new referendum due to protestsReferendums take quite a bit of time to organise – the Electoral Commission recommends that “referendum legislation should be clear at least six months before it is required to be implemented”, though it could probably in reality be done somewhat quicker than that.Either way, with the clock running down, a second referendum would effectively require an extension (or revocation) of Article 50.Nevertheless, the path to a second referendum depends on the politics of the issue and who supports one.\u0026nbspWould the EU grant an extension?The EU has mostly refused to discuss the hypothetical question of an extension. Some countries, including Ireland, have said they would not stand in the way, but that it is for the UK to ask for one. The UK government has said it does not want one and that its policy is to leave on 29 March.Behind the scenes, EU officials believe a short extension could be possible, but that it should not go beyond May, when the next European parliament elections are due to be called.The UK would, by law, have to participate in these elections unless it had departed the EU beforehand.Officials are wary of the idea of granting an extension for no reason, or just to buy the UK time, if\u0026nbspthere is\u0026nbspno prospect of further process – they believe there should be a reason behind it.Holding a referendum would probably\u0026nbspbe an acceptable reason, though it is impossible to know for sure\u0026nbspwhat will happen until the UK government actually asks the question.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The EU says that for a country to participate in the single market, and reap economic rewards from having goods and services flow freely across borders, it must accept the free movement of people.So if we want to control immigration to a significant degree, to the extent that we set\u0026nbspour\u0026nbspown policy in full, it does mean leaving the single market.And\u0026nbspif we want to maintain an open border\u0026nbspbetween\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland and the Republic, the EU have consistently argued that Northern Ireland at least must remain part of the customs union – otherwise goods that have not been subjected to the common tariff could make their way into EU territory across the Irish border.These are just two issues emanating from the single market and customs union questions, but there are many more. To pick one – the closer a country is to both affects what kind of trade deals, if any, it can make with the rest of the world. \u0026nbspIt is for all these reasons that both of the major British political parties have opted for middle-of-the-road Brexit policies, that seek to compromise between keeping as much of the economic benefit of these two systems as possible, whilst also seeking to satisfy the 2016 referendum result, by doing away with parts of them that have fed displeasure over EU membership.Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have said they will leave the single market and customs union, allowing them to end immigration that is governed by the EU’s free movement principle, which so riled many of their voters.Corbyn calls for public ownership of railways amid train fare hikeBut whereas Jeremy Corbyn has backed a new customs union with the EU, Ms May has said she wants the UK to have no part in a customs union with Europe, which would allow greater leeway to sign trade deals with other countries.Mr Corbyn has said he wants a deal that delivers the “exact same benefits” of the single market, albeit with greater leeway for the British government to intervene in domestic industry, something restricted by the EU’s state aid rules.Ms May meanwhile has said that after the transition period, she wants a trade deal with the EU that would leave the UK outside of the single market, but with as frictionless trade\u0026nbspas possible. In the meantime, Britain would effectively adhere to customs union rules and single market rules during a transition which could last to December 2020 and beyond.Whatever the outcome, the state of the UK economy, the lot of the British people and the government’s freedom to act after Brexit is likely to be directly related to the country’s links to these two critical supranational structures.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Credit card debt was at £72.5bn, or £2,688 per household.“The government is skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth,” Ms O’Grady said. “A strong economy needs people spending wages, not credit cards and loans.Credit card debt hits £72.5bn despite fears for UK economy’s future“Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers. Trade unions should be allowed the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate higher wages.”Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,\u0026nbspsaid student loan debt is a “different animal” from credit card debt, for example, because borrowers don’t pay money back unless they are earning over £21,000.\u0026nbsp“This prevents the most extreme outcomes,” he said.“In aggregate, consumer debt as a whole is below the level it was in 2008, although that is hardly a comfort and means there is still vulnerability.”Mr Kara also pointed to concerns around the\u0026nbsplow level of saving by households. “If there is some kind of trigger or\u0026nbspflare-up – most obviously a rise in interest rates or unemployment – that could have a negative effect on the economy.”A sharp rise in interest rates could have a “material impact” on economic growth which, at 1.4 per cent, is already comparatively low, Mr Kara said.On the positive side, he said\u0026nbspthe Bank of England’s stress tests demonstrate that lenders are in a better financial position than they were before the financial crisis, with more capital to act as a buffer in the event of a shock.However, the central bank has much less room to manoeuvre than it did in 2008. Faced with a\u0026nbspdownturn the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would typically lower interest rates, making debt cheaper and fuelling a recovery. But rates are already close to all-time lows.On the other hand, if inflation were to rise the bank would typically raise interest rates to cool demand and rein in price increases.Perhaps the most likely trigger for rising inflation in the near future is a potential fall in the value of the pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWhile governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that rate rises could occur if the UK crashes out of the EU, the MPC would likely be reluctant to raise its benchmark too far or too fast for fear of damaging an already fragile economy at a time of upheaval.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $110bn of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US\u0026nbspcompanies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\u0026nbspWashington, Europe and other trading partners complain Beijing\u0027s tactics violate its market-opening obligations.\u0026nbspThe standoff also reflects American anxiety about China\u0027s rise as a potential competitor in telecommunications and other technology. Mr Trump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives like “Made in China 2025,” which calls for the state-led creation of global competitors in such fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. American officials worry those might erode US\u0026nbspindustrial leadership.\u0026nbspThe ruling Communist Party is reluctant to give up initiatives it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\u0026nbspChina\u0027s leaders have tried to defuse complaints by emphasising its potential as an export market and by promising to increase foreign access to their auto, finance and other industries as well as the technology initiatives.\u0026nbspEconomists say the 90-day postponement of additional tariff increases that had been meant to take effect 1 January\u0026nbspmay be too short to settle the disputes bedevilling US-Chinese relations.\u0026nbspBeijing\u0027s goal may be to show enough progress to persuade Trump to extend his deadline, they say.\u0026nbspCooling economic growth in both countries is turning up the pressure to reach a settlement.\u0026nbspChinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 per cent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspeconomy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.Beijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticise his tactics but echo US\u0026nbspcomplaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\u0026nbspThe European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organisation in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\u0026nbspFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with US\u0026nbspcurbs on exports of “dual use” technology with possible military applications. They complain China\u0027s companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\u0026nbspSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump\u0027s tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

What do they have to hide? I am not afraid, and I have nothing to hide ... As far as I am concerned it can be broadcast live, so the public can see and hear it,” he said.He then\u0026nbspclaimed the country’s attorney-general was facing “non-stop” pressure to indict him.In response, Israel’s justice\u0026nbspministry released a terse statement saying that the investigations against Mr Netanyahu have been carried out professionally and thoroughly.Opposition leaders were also quick to respond, and blasted the leader, who is now in his fourth term.Labour Party chief\u0026nbspAvi Gabbay called the speech and Instagram deluge a “horror show” and said in a statement “in a normal country, the prime minister does not attack the law enforcement authorities”.He added: “Instead of caring about\u0026nbspthe safety of the south’s residents, the cost of living or the deteriorating health system, Netanyahu is busy saving himself from the investigations.”Netanyahu’s office (Instagram))Meanwhile Tzipi Livni, head of the liberal Hatnuah Party, called Netanyahu’s statements “a victim-like, hysterical attack on law enforcement”, according to left-wing daily Haaretz.Mr Netanyahu is currently facing three graft cases, dubbed 4000, 2000 and 1000. He has repeatedly denied all the charges.\u0026nbspIn case 4000, police have alleged that Mr Netanyahu granted regulatory favours to Israel’s leading telecommunications company, Bezeq, in return for more positive coverage on Walla, a news website belonging to the firm’s owner.Case 2000 focuses on suspicions Mr Netanyahu negotiated a deal with the\u0026nbspYedioth Ahronoth newspaper for better coverage in return for promises to limit the circulation of a rival.In the third investigation, case 1000, police argue that he received expensive gifts from wealthy friends.The attorney general is expected to decide whether to push ahead with an indictment in these cases within the next few weeks.Netanyahu’s office (Instagram))Mr Netanyahu said on Monday\u0026nbspdoing so before the election on 9 April was a “lack of justice” as he would be unable to answer the claims. His recent decision to call a snap election, seven months early, is seen by many as a direct appeal to voters for a fresh political mandate to bat off the investigations.While some supporters joined in with the premier’s Instagram jokes on Tuesday, the bizarre outburst also drew widespread criticism with some people tweeting altered photos of Mr Netanyahu wearing prison uniform.Opposition figures\u0026nbsphit back on their own social media platforms. Merav Michaeli, a Labour Party member of parliament, posted a photo of a foot on Instagram saying: “A prime minister under indictment is like a sock with a hole”.The elections in Israel also come under the spectre of\u0026nbsprenewed conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank.Israel and Gaza, which is run by the militant group Hamas, were pushed to the brink of war several times last year amid some of the heaviest exchanges of cross border fire since the last conflict in 2014.Kanye‘ (Benjamin Netanyahu’s office (Instagram))But at the close of the year violence also flared in the occupied West Bank, which is run by Hamas’s political rival Fatah, after Hamas operatives launched a series of deadly shooting attacks on Israelis.Israeli forces said on Tuesday they had arrested Assam Barghouti, the Palestinian man accused of shooting dead two soldiers at a bus stop near the Israeli settlement Givat Assaf in the Ramallah area last month.He is also accused of being involved with his brother Salah in another shooting nearby, close to the Ofra settlement, that caused the death of a baby and wounded seven.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.”She added that she had been imprisoned for months inside her house, and suffered “physical, emotional and verbal abuse”.Amid an outcry from rights groups, Thai authorities eventually reversed their decision to send her back, but her status in the country is still unsure. The United Nations’ refugee agency is currently investigating her case, while her supporters are calling for a third country to step in.A petition on Change.org calling on UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt to grant Ms Qunun asylum has been signed by more than 80,000 people at the time of writing. It follows a direct appeal from Ms Qunun to Mr Hunt on Twitter on Sunday.“I appeal to you personally @Jeremy_Hunt to organise an emergency UK travel document for me. My life is on the line,” she wrote.A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson\u0026nbsptold The Independent they were\u0026nbspconcerned about the case and were\u0026nbspmonitoring developments closely.Ms Qunun was granted a temporary permit to enter Thailand, and UN officials interviewed Ms Qunun on Tuesday as part of their investigation into her case for refugee status.“It could take several days to process the case and determine next steps,” UNHCR’s Thailand representative Giuseppe de Vincentiis said in a statement.But her case may be complicated further by the arrival of her father and brother in Bangkok. Thailand’s immigration chief, Surachate Hakpan, said the pair arrived in the country on Tuesday and wanted to talk to Ms Qunun.One woman’s bravery has exposed Saudi Arabia’s treatment of womenThere are concerns now that Ms Qunun’s family will try to bring her back to Saudi Arabia. Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch’s deputy director for Asia, told Reuters that her father’s arrival was a “source of concern”.“We have no idea what he is going to do ... whether he will try to find out where she is and go harass her. We don’t know whether he is going to try to get the embassy to do that,” he said.The Australian government has reportedly said it would consider an application for a humanitarian visa after the UNHCR has completed its investigation.Ms Qunun’s ordeal comes at a time when Saudi Arabia’s rights record is under increased scrutiny following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which caused international outrage.Created with Sketch.

Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.In a pure no-deal scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.A no deal would also see residency rights for EU nationals in the UK potentially disappear overnight.In theory, these people would become third country nationals, meaning they would be subject to domestic immigration rules.There is also uncertainty over what would happen at the  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.Theresa May announced on January th that a vote on her EU Withdrawal deal will take place on Tuesday th January.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Businesses receive a -page document on Friday, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government over the next few days.The news comes as:Theresa May’s Government plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.Aides of Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed he would call on colleagues on Tuesday to dramatically accelerate No Deal planning given the deadlock over the PM’s Brexit deal.The Sun can reveal he ‘activated’ the NHS’ own plans last week – amid spiralling fears key medicines could be caught up in chaos at the border.One ally said: “He doesn’t want no deal but thinks it’s essential that we prepare for it as a possible outcome.”It came as Justice Secretary David Gauke threatened to resignthe PM puts Britain on a course to leave the EU without a deal.He said: “I couldn’t support a conscious decision to crash out at the end of March and I don’t think there are many who could.”But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.He separately said he’d love a “crack” at being the next Prime Minister.Meanwhile, allies of International Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt revealed she would back the idea of a ‘managed’ No Deal at a key speech today.And Trade Secretary Liam Fox became the first Brexit-backing Cabinet Minister to say it may be an idea to allow the Commons an ‘indicative vote’ on alternative Brexit plans such as Norway Plus or a second referendum.As bitter Brexit battles rage on: Businesses receive a -page document on Friday about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government.The papers show:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000458593008.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"space final frontier theme park ride","story":"And it never does.All we ever get back are some meaningless graphs and a lot of algebra.And before we get a chance to ask whether it was a sensible use of our money, Oliver the boffin is back with his bowl, saying: “Can I have some more, because I want to get a closer look at Uranus.”Back in , they launched a probe which would fly past Pluto.We were told, after it did that, that the furthest outpost in the solar system was “very cold”.But before anyone said “you don’t say”, Professor Boffin was out with his collecting box again saying thathe could just lay his hands on another couple of trillion, he could get the Pluto spacecraft to take a look at something called Ultima Thule.The ultimate roof box It’s a -mile long lump of rock shaped a bit like a peanut.“It’ll help us understand where we came from” he told us, predictably. Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have faced down worse than a few rocky months.Which is why “apocalyptic” Remainer predictions, some debunked today, cut no ice.Yes, they may terry the sort of person prone to blind panictheir iPhone battery runs low. The rest will soldier on.The Sun has far less confidence in a Government that has so far proved utterly shambolic and just as reliant on dishonest spin as Tony Blair was.If there is chaos at our ports,prices rise,there are temporary shortages, do we trust Chris Grayling to sort them out after his rail, drones and ferries fiascos  How about self-promoting “The Sajid” Javid  Or clueless Karen Bradley  Or spineless David Gauke Does glum bean-counter Philip Hammond have it in him to slash taxes and turbo-charge the economy  Does he hell.True, at least Theresa May’s Cabinet aren’t Corbyn, McDonnell and Abbott.But, with a couple of exceptions, that’s all her lacklustre crew have going for them.TORY Brexiteers and the DUP won’t back Mrs May’s deal without a legal guarantee that we can exit the toxic Irish “backstop”.Not for nothing is No’s effort to extract some vague new promise from Brussels nicknamed “Operation Figleaf”. That’s all it would be.Many Brexiteers are unafraid of No Deal, or willing to bet Leave would win any second referendum comfortably. They prefer either to surrendering our economic future to Brussels for ever.If EU leaders genuinely want this signed off they are going the wrong way about it.A SOBERING week for Ireland’s gobby PM.After all his naïve grandstanding, aimed at thwarting Brexit, Leo Varadkar is on the brink of begging the EU for a huge bailoutthere’s a No Deal.He could have spent two years talking sense into Brussels, working on a decent deal to suit them and us. Instead he acted as their patsy, issuing childish threats and hyping up the hard-border myth . . . just as the EU wanted.Now his farmers face potential ruin, and he may need a “mega money” rescue.Hate to say it, Leo. But we did tell you.A FEW selfish rotters have won the Lottery over the years.How refreshing, then, that £million EuroMillions couple Frances and Patrick Connolly aim to make dozens of others rich too. “It’s going to be so much fun giving it away,” Frances says.Good luck to them.

There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess. The insane pouting contortions of Candice “Bake Off” Brown during Celebrity Mastermind.The BBC somehow crowbarring an anti-Brexit dig into The Greatest Dancer.And Dee Dee Wilde calling her old Tena Lady troop, on the same show, Pan’s Fans, rather than the far more appropriate and eye-catching Pads People. Basic stuff, really.Steve Howey: “You need to have experienced that experience to have the experience.”And Phil Thompson: “All these City players are like for like. Even Danilo, who isn’t as good as Kyle Walker.”JUST when they thought we couldn’t send them anything worse than the potato famine, up pipes Last Leg Of The Year guest Sue Perkins with this Brexit bonus: “My New Year’s resolution is to try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.”Andthere are any genealogists who can help, send the information to me marked “Generation Game: Urgent.”Knighthood’s in the post.Paul Ryan’s Farage cameo on Brexit: The Uncivil War.Clarkson not trying to be likeable, on Millionaire, which, ironically, made him very likeable.Bradley Walsh hating every second of his skye on ITV’s Breaking Dad.Simplicity Cremations’ perfectly-placed advert during The Last Leg Of The Year .And Billy Connolly, overwhelmed by love, on BBC, paying tribute to: “All the things that made me good and bad, Scotland.”Match Of The Day’s Jonathan Pearce on Alo Morata: “He needs to do that game in, game out to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”“They need to do that gay men, gay marriage to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”Sent in by Iain Milne, Newcastle. Picture research: Amy Reading.TV dramatists haven’t yet rewritten the result of Brexit.But, trust me, they will eventually. This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It came as Mrs May acknowledged for the first time that she could lose next Tuesday’s crunch vote. She told her cabinet she would “move quickly” in the event of her deal falling. Ministers suggested she would put it before the Commons again within days. But the PM failed to set out her plans beyond that - although sources said she again ruled out other options, including a second referendum and delaying Brexit. It laid bare the bitter ide at the top of Government with Brexiteer ministers believing no deal would be better than a bad one - and others fiercely against crashing out.  Several think Mrs May could fall back to a no deal Brexit in the event of a humiliating defeat in further votes. “There was a real sense in the room that we’re boxed in. Every option was raised and then roundly quashed,” one told the Mirror. “The PM really believes it’s her responsibility to take us out of the EU come what may.” However, Mrs May has previously said a no deal Brexit could be catastrophic for the economy. If she backed crashing out she would face dozens of ministerial resignations, including from her cabinet. Justice Secretary David Gauke has already said he would walk. More than  Tory MPs have publicly indicated they would try to stop it. Welfare secretary Amber Rudd warned colleagues: “History will take a dim view of a Cabinet that presses ahead with no deal.” She appealled to them to “find the centre” and work with Labour MPs to get a majority for an alternative Brexit agreement. In a further sign of defiance, business secretary Greg Clark told MPs that no deal should “not be contemplated” because it would cripple British firms that trade with the EU.   In bizarre scenes, the PM’s top ministers mocked hardline Brexiteers who believe they can get a better dealthey vote down her plan. Environment Secretary Michael Gove triggered laughter as he compared Brexiteers to “mid-s swingers waiting for Scarlett Johansson to turn up”. Ms Rudd quipped: “Pierce Brosnan as well.” Earlier, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay insisted the UK will leave the EU on  March despite cliams it could extend article . UK officials are said to be “putting out feelers” and “testing the waters” on the idea of delaying the date of exit to buy more time to find a deal.The Mirror understands that Commons leader Ms Leadsom would rather be sacked than oversee the legislation needed to postpone the UK’s departure. MPs kicked off their ‘guerilla’ war in Parliament inflicting a defeat on the Government by blocking taxation powers unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. They won by  votes to  in the first of many attempts to block or amend key legislation before Brexit Day. Another cabinet minister told the Mirror that “in extremis” they were prepared to delay five outstanding bills in order to deliver Brexit.  But they did not rule out hauling MPs in at weekends and over the February half term to get legislation through. Mrs May met last night with some of a cross-party group of more than  backbenchers who have signed a letter calling on her to rule out a no deal. One Labour MP present said: “She was mostly Maybot, it was a very wobbly performance. She’s not convincing anyone.” The PM is pinning her hopes on EU chiefs granting yet more concessions on Brexit before next week’s vote. She was offered a glimmer of hope when Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the EU was willing to give written assurances about the withdrawal agreement. But most of the PM’s own cabinet privately believe she faces a humiliating defeat. The Government last night confirmed MPs would be asked to vote on exactly the same deal as the one she postponed before Christmas. Jeremy Corbyn said: “The Government has admitted that nothing has changed. Theresa May has run down the clock and secured no legal or other changes to the withdrawal agreement. The delay has achieved nothing beyond wasting a month.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how esa benefit paid early","story":"NewsHow ESA benefit paid early hit our readers - It scared me so much I was sickEXCLUSIVE: Despite no one receiving less money overall, worried readers say theyve left high and dry by a DWP benefits glitch.

A large number of Employment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowanceclaimants received half their fortnightly payment ahead of time last week. The government guaranteed no one will lose out - saying the rest of each persons payment WILL arrive on its usual date. But that did not stop more than  people e-mailing us after we alerted readers to the glitch in a news story last week. Even though people are getting the same amount of money as they would anyway, the fault has left desperate claimants high and dry.  Some told us they thought the early payment was a Christmas bonus, spent it, and are now short of cash. Others thought the changing amount meant their benefits had been stopped, and panicked. Heres what the problem is - and what our readers said in a flood of e-mails to the Mirror. We have made all cases anonymous to protect their privacy. What exactly is happening   The error has paid out both sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance early to people across the country. Usually, both those benefits are paid in one lump sum fortnightly. But many claimants who were due to be paid this week received half their payment early. Guidance on the DWPs website confirms: If your ESA payment is due in the week starting  January , you might be paid half of it early in the week starting  December . The other half of your payment will be paid on the correct day. Your next fortnightly ESA payment will be paid as normal. If your JSA payment is due in the week starting  January , you might be paid half of it early in the week starting  December . If your JSA payment is due in the week starting  January , you might be paid half of it early in the week starting  January . The other half of your payment will be paid on the correct day. Your next fortnightly JSA payment will be paid as normal. It is not yet known how many people were affected. A DWP spokesperson said: “Some ESA claimants may have received an early half of their fortnightly payment. These claimants will now receive the second half of their payment on their usual pay date. “No one has lost out and all ESA claimants will be paid on time. “Staff are available to offer guidance for those seeking further support.” What have people told us  I was worried my benefits had been stoppedJust checked my bank balance before going out and saw that I had a payment that was equivalent to half of my ESA payment, that i receive fortnightly.At first I was worried that my benefits had been stopped or cut, as i had a problem with governments disability assessment last year.I was glad to find your story to put my mind at rest. However I can only imagine that there will be numerous claimants who will either not realise this payment has been made. or who will not have access to the internet and may overspend this money and then be short next week. I spent all my money over Christmas without even knowing I spent all my money in my bank account over Christmas without even knowing that I had been paid a weeks money. So now on Tuesday I wont be able to pay all my bills because I will only get  weeks money. Now i start  in debt..happy new year. It scared me so much I was sickI found out on Friday that half my ESA was paid into my bank. I usually get it fortnightly.Im disabled  suffer anxiety  panic attacks also so when I saw the money I thought thats it, no more ESA.It scared me so much I was sick.Oh my goodness!! Nightmare!! I thought it was a Christmas bonus I care for a family member and thought it was the Christmas bonus... so I spent the money on the family. Next week Ill have half my pay to live off for two weeks. Ive worked all my le and havent been claiming long. Never in all my le have I been messed about so much by any institution or job as I have by the job centre. My son will have to go to school without lunch moneyI spent the money not knowing it had been put in early. My son starts back at school tomorrow and I don’t think I’m gonna be able to send him with his usual lunch money because of this glitch. It also means I can’t even pay my phone bill. This has left me in a bad situation! I’m disabled and have no family. Panic - I thought my payments had been docked I received a deposit into my account last night which is half of my usual amount. Nearly gave me heart failure - thought some kind person had docked my payment without my knowledge. Total PANIC!I was so relieved to fall across this post by way of notication. The DWP seems to be no longer fit for purpose. I thought it was a loan - now Im short of money I applied for a budgeting loan and assumed I had been awarded it, as there was nothing  I could think of as to why I received pound well over a week before my due date.I know the usual procedure with loans is to sign it first but I assumed it was a new way of doing things.I now wont have enough money when I am paid on Tuesday for bills and direct debits etc.Does anyone know what I can do  I am now going to have to get a doorstep loan with massive interest to keep up with my bills.Alternatively I can decide whether to have gas but no electricity or vice versa or have food but pay no rent. I am fed up of it just being one of those things! It was certainly alarming I received a half payment today.It won’t affect me negatively as long as the other half does indeed arrive on time but it was certainly alarming.If only it had been an underpayment correction! The system is often breaking down The DWP payment system is often breaking down and payments are late or non existent.It seems to have become less efficient since the introduction of UC, even though any of us are still receiving ongoing benefits from the old system with no changes in circumstance. This is causing me huge panic Im affected by this and it has turned my world upside down.I struggle with mental health issues and this is causing me a huge panic as I dont know how to budget now. This has caused massive stress and anxiety This has caused massive stress and anxiety around budgeting. Due to some of my disabilities I am unable to manage with any change and really struggle, this has sent my stress levels extremely high and caused me to utilise my emergency medication. Its ridiculous - no one called I think its completely ridiculous. No-one called. I just only knew something was up when i checked my bank.Tried calling esa to find out what was occurring to find an automated message about a glitch.It was very confusing and felt we needed more than a automated message on there phone lines to explain. Where can you turn for helpyoure affected  If you are having trouble there are a number of organisations you can turn to. These include:The DWP offers budgeting loans for certain essential goods and clothes. The DWP also makes limited hardship payments for some people who cant afford basic needs. Find out more from Citizens Advice or turnus. DWP officials advise people to checktheir local council offers help. For last resort cases find a Trussell Trust food bank here.Dont forget, the DWP insists no one is actually receiving any less money in this case - its just come at dferent times.

The immigration health surcharge has been hiked from pound to pound a year, or pound to pound for international students. It applies to people who come to the UK from outside the European Economic Area- which includes the EU and other countries - and stay for more than six months. When they announced the move  months ago Tory ministers said the up-front fee would raise around pound million a year. The surcharge was originally brought in by the Government in  in a clampdown on so-called health tourism.NHS hospitals were also looking at plans back in  to make people show passports to prove they are eligible for treatment. Ministers have been criticised for the focus on health tourism after research suggested it cost less than stationery.But they previously insisted the increased charges would maintain access to the health service while ensuring migrants make a fair contribution. Asylum seekers, refugees and trafficking and slavery victims are exempt, and ministers insist urgent and emergency care would never be delayed.  The increase today still stops short of plans in the  Tory manesto .At the time Tories claimed the charge would not double but triple, to pound and pound respectively. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We welcome long-term migrants using the NHS, but we believe it is right that they make a fair and proportionate contribution to its long-term sustainability. “Parliament agrees and has approved the order we proposed to increase the immigration health surcharge so it better reflects the actual costs to the NHS. “The extra money raised will go directly towards sustaining and protecting our world-class healthcare system.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parliament gates lockdown man held","story":"NewsParliament gates on lockdown as man held by armed policeArmed police \"pounced\" on a man at the Carriage Gates entrance in Westminster just feet from where PC Keith Palmer was killed in ShareByBen GlazeDeputy political editorMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN News \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man has been held at at the Carriage Gates entrance to Parliament.

Louie Vella, , said he was heading towards the escalators leading out of Canary Wharf Tube when he heard a thud behind him yesterday. He turned to see a man lying on his back just five to  feet away from him - and a matter of feet away from a young mum pushing a pram with a second child holding her hand. As Louie, from east London, ran to the mans aid and desperately tried to find a pulse, he watched blood spill into a large puddle. The most surreal part of the event was seeing how fast these things can happen, how fast death is, he said. It was very scary. Louie said he realised the man had no pulse and was not breathing, adding that people around were in a panic. Were you at the station at the time  Contact webnews@mirror.  He described the tragic incident as surreal, saying witnesses seemed spaced out. People were still getting off the trains, and a dead body was there, he added. He told how there were young children around - and one family in particular the man almost landed on. Louie described the face of the mother the man could have landed on saying it had all colour drained from it, as she stood frozen from shock with a dead body at her feet. The scary part is that he landed closely behind me, but as I turned round there was a lady with her pram with two children of ages less than four that he could have landed on also making their way through the station, Louie, a recruiting consultant told . She was walking in the opposite direction to me - she had just walked past me. He was too close to her and she looked very shaken up. It must have been a matter of feet. She had a pram and another child in her hand. She didnt know what had happened. She was white. All the colour had gone from her face.

I assume someone ushered her away from the area. When I looked up after she was gone.   Louie, who was travelling to Canary Wharf after meeting a friend, said he had headphones on as he was walking but was alerted to the incident by a thud.

Louie said: I was on my way out of the station heading towards the escalators and I heard a harrowing thud behind me. I turned around and no more than - feet behind me laid the male on the floor. A crowd stood in shock and my first instinct was to go up to him and seeI could help. I grabbed his wrist to seeI could feel a pulse hoping he was alive, I was quickly joined by another man who tried to do his bit to help. Blood spilled into a large puddle around the male. I quickly learned he had no pulse and was not breathing, people around were in a panic.

But what sort of parent decides to hurt those children as a result When Valentina Naidenko discovered her daughter had been swapped with that of another woman in a hospital blunder  years earlier, she did not rail or blame. She said: I am happy that I now know. Svetlana is my daughter. And Katya is my daughter too, this is how it is. When Maria Gerbeno was sent home from hospital with a baby that wasnt hers, she started legal action for DNA tests, but didnt spit her dummy. She said: I spent three weeks with a baby that was not my daughter but I gave her all my love and knew that the other mum would be doing the same. But when father-of-three Richard Mason found out he had been infertile all along, he lashed out at his adulterous we, launched legal action, and demanded his money back. Its not surprising two of his sons no longer speak to him its a quandary why the third is still bothering.  Parenthood - biological or adoptive - demands that you put someone s needs before your own. It applies equally to mums and dads. And in his rage, Richard Mason has all but written off his children. As a co-founder of comparison site Moneysupermarket, he made poundm overnight when the firm floated in . That same year, he split up with his we Kate, who he had been married to for  years. They agreed a orce settlement of poundm, much of which was an advance payment for his childrens private school fees. According to reports, in the first years of their separation he paid her pound, a year in child maintenance. A nice wage for many, but a drop in the ocean for him - even assuming he never made a penny extra in interest or earnings, it represented just .% of his remaining wealth.  In  Richard was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a disease which had led to the death of his sister. While fumbling to grasp his own mortality, he was given a second blow when the doctor said he was probably infertile, too. He texted his ex to askthe children, the oldest then aged  and twins aged , were his she assured him they were. At this stage a decent parent would ask themselves whether further questions would harm their children, who had already endured a orce. Not even the most mediocre of parents would feel their now-grown children would enjoy having old marital wounds reopened. Richard Mason, though, sought out the UK expert on paternity fraud and launched legal action. He did so even though his oldest son warned him it would mean they never spoke again.  Ive been the victim of adultery. Its horrendous, and betrayal hurts whether you find out at the time or a decade later. The first reaction is always to kick down doors, wail, and throw lawyers at the partner you now hate. But when you have children, your rage is qualied because you have to put them first. Or you should, unless youre Richard Mason and still fairly upset about the -odd % of your wealth which the law required you to spend on the family you used to have. . Instead he decided to settle some scores, not just with his ex but with her lover too.  So he launched a bid for some of his poundm back, and got pound,. But it still wasnt enough. He disbelieved his wes denials, so told their oldest son he was infertile even before it had been confirmed. The son confronted his mum, who confessed to an affair. Richards opinion about who was the biggest victim is clear. I was just thinking, s*** my le is ruined... Im just a guy who was there when they were brought up. He now refers to the boys, in conversations with others, as the sons I thought were mine. He plans to tell his -year-old mother with Alzheimers that she no longer has grandchildren. He believes birthday parties, graduations, and his own grandchildren have been stolen. Yet this man is the only dad they know. He was there at their births, and throughout their childhood. And what happened is neither their, nor even their mothers, fault.  There was no paternity fraud, because there was no intent to deceive. If Richard didnt know he was infertile theres no way his we could have done - there was no con, no scam, no cuckold duped into raising another mans children. At the absolute worst, she may have been uncertain - but as the affair was not discovered, and the marriage survived, she presumably took the view that mentioning it would have been horribly damaging for their children. Too late now. Its been mentioned all over the newspapers by an angry man trying to humiliate his ex-we and flush out her lover. Richard continues his obsession with parenthood equating to money, saying he believes the genetic parent has never paid a penny towards his sons.The latest news is that he is threatening to write a book which will be littered with clues as to the mans identity, which it appears he has suspicions of but is wary of stating as bluntly as he does his financial calculations.Would he sue the biological father,he could  We shall have to hold our breath, wont we.  In interviews Richard has said: I still think of them as my boys... and I miss them so much. Yet his actions are those of an angry sparrow whos found three cuckoos in his nest. You cannot love your children, but count them in pounds and pence. You cannot put their needs before yours, while exposing their very conception to national media scrutiny. You cannot possibly risk your child never speaking to you again,it can be avoided. But the fact Richard Mason got cashback on his hurt is not enough: now he wants to haul his family into the court of public opinion, where he can count on a gammon-faced jury to denounce a scheming female who somehow analysed his sperm years before the doctors did.

MoneySupermarket co-founder Richard Mason, , spoke earlier this week of his shock when doctors told him in  he had been infertile since birth due to the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. The bombshell - and subsequent DNA tests - meant his eldest son, now , and his -year-old twins were another mans. He launched a legal bid against their mother - whom he is orced from - and the -year-old now lives with new we Emma Louise Jones-Mason, , in Rhos on Sea, Wales. Do you know the family or have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror  He has since revealed that coverage of his devastating ordeal has prompted a flurry of female fans to contact him. But he has bad news for his new admirers - hes a one woman man. Im only devoted to Emma, he told Mail Online. Since the story has come out, Ive been contacted by at least  women from across the globe - from Indonesia, Singapore and Africa - wanting to be my friend. Ive also been contacted by men who have been in a very similar situation to me, and from people whose children have cystic fibrosis, who have askedI can help them financially. He has not, however, heard from his ex-we Kate or the three boys. Heartbroken Richard almost took his own le after the crushing news he wasnt the biological father of the children he had spent more than  years doting on.  However he was stopped from killing himself by his love for soul mate Emma Louise, who he married in . Now Richard is planning to write a book about his traumatic ordeal and plans to litter it with clues as to the identity of his exs lover. His story came to light after he launched a legal bid to recover some of the poundmillion orce settlement his ex-we Kate received, and sued for paternity fraud. As a result, he says two of the boys have broken off contact with him. Kate, who lives with a new partner in Uttoxeter, Staffs, has since been ordered to pay pound, after a two-year legal case that allowed her to keep the identity of the real father a secret. Richard believes that the same man fathered all three boys during an on off four-year affair Kate, , embarked on in the late s.  But she only confessed to the adultery in , ten years on from their orce, when he confronted her about the children’s paternity. All she admitted was that he was a member of Barclays staff and they met up in a London hotel from time to time when she attended events as a union official. She claimed they had sex on six to  occasions but used condoms and so she insisted Richard must be the dad. Richard believes a possible clue to the identity of the real father is that Kate became interested in Judaism, insisted all three children were given Jewish middle names and refused to have them christened. Although two of the boys still refuse to speak to him, he was overjoyed to receive a sweet text message from the third last month. It read: Dad, as I explained from the beginning you would never not be dad to me regardless of all this.  Of course I’ll stay in touch, that will never change… I’m always here for you too and you will always be Dad. Love you x. Richard said that discovering the boys were not his own left his le in pieces. “You don’t know what’s real and what isn’t – it’s asI’m living in The Matrix,” he said. Richard hopes his book will lead to the mystery man being identied and is also offering pound, for information. He said it was: “Not least for the boys’ sake because they will want to know who their real father is, even , hopefully, they’ll always think of me as their dad.” He added: I still regard them as my boys even though I’m not their biological father, and I miss them so much.

The horric story of the capture of Bellfield has been told over the last three nights in ITV drama Manhunt. In the book upon which it is based, former Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton says that during his investigations he discovered Bellfield had been at the centre of the sickening rape yet shockingly was never even questioned, even though he gave the victim’s freshly laundered clothes from the night of the rape to the police. It occurred in June , just two months before Bellfield bludgeoned French student Amelie Delagrange, , to death.   Sutton, who led the successful investigation into Bellfield’s murders of Amelie, and -year-old Marsha McDonnell, which in turn led to his conviction for the murder of -year-old Milly Dowler, dedicates a chapter of the new book, published tomorrow, to this baffling incident, describing Bellfield’s ability to escape suspicion for the rape as “staggering”. Sutton believes it is possibleBellfield had been treated as a rape suspect then, he would not have been free to go on and kill Amelie, but adds: “With hindsight you can say that was the turning point, the opportunity that was missed. He is cunning and clever and good at avoiding responsibility for what he has done.” Sutton explains the episode began when Bellfield demanded a vulnerable friend, Peter Rodrigues, store  ecstasy tablets for him in his sick mother’s empty flat while she was in hospital. Simultaneously, Bellfield, who already had a teenage lover, received the news from her that she had a -year-old friend in desperate need of a place to stay.   The girl, Sutton describes, was in trouble for a separate drug offence and had fallen out with her parents. He outlines how Bellfield appears to have spotted an opportunity for more sickening abuse, and arranged for the girl to stay at Rodrigues’ mother’s flat – where he demanded Rodrigues drug her and await his arrival. The next morning the girl woke up remembering nothing, in strange clothes, and in pain – knowing she has been raped, but not by whom. She rang her friend, who asked Bellfield to collect her and bring her to his flat, which he did.   Shortly afterwards, a worried Rodrigues confronted Bellfield and was seriously assaulted by the killer. But cunning Bellfield phoned an ambulance and told paramedics and police his ‘good friend’ had been attacked by two other acquaintances. Officers initially smelt a rat and did question Bellfield over the assault, but he stuck to his story, and with Rodrigues unconscious for weeks, he walked free. When the rape victim later revealed to police she has been drugged and attacked, and also mentioned the assault on Rodrigues, police even turned to Bellfield for help in finding the flat where it may have taken place. Charming as ever, he directed them, labelling Rodrigues a drug dealer and telling them where the drugs would be stashed. Even when Bellfield revealed he had the victim’s clothes, washed of all evidence, his part in the incident was seemingly not questioned at all. Sutton says: “Bellfield, for reasons I cannot explain or discern, was never investigated as a potential suspect and that investigation was closed.”   Adding: “As he had done for most of his adult le, he gave a good impression of a man who was a friend to the police, who knew lots of people and lots of things, and who could be a very useful contact for the future. “It seems he succeeded, once more, in manipulating a dficult situation to his own advantage.” Sutton says: “I had no doubt that Bellfield’s behaviour throughout this episode had been criminal and yet he had never been properly investigated. “The concept of him being allowed to drop off a rape victim’s clothing without further inquiries being made as to his role in the offence was staggering. “The information we had gained from the victim and the other young girls placed him squarely at the centre of events, yet he had been ignored.” He adds: “I can’t understand the circumstances where someone would say ‘I can you get you those clothes I’ll bring them into you’. “Why that was allowed to happen I don’t know.” Sutton and his team soon learned of Bellfield’s grim history of violent and sexual abuse of women and girls during their investigation into the murders of Amelie and Marsha, and the attempted murder of another Londoner, -year-old Kate Sheedy. It is now also known he was involved in a paedophile ring targeting girls in children’s homes in west London.   He says that by speaking to numerous sources including the young rape victim herself, Sutton was able to piece together Bellfield’s murky world – and also understand the charm he used to wriggle out of suspicion by making himself helpful to police. Bellfield had been used as an official informant previously by officers, but was eventually dropped as he considered too dangerous. In this case, Sutton says, the officer involved acted only “naively” and “unprofessionally”, not for “personal gain.” When Rodrigues eventually came round weeks later he was charged and pleaded guilty to possession of drugs, receiving a suspended prison sentence. Bellfield though was never charged with anything connected to the incident. And Sutton believes this will not have been the only time Bellfield got away with a crime - sure there will be many more victims who suffered at Bellfield’s hands without justice. “I don’t knowhe’s killed anyone ,” he says, “but I think there will be hundreds of people assaulted or abused or attacked by Bellfield over the years.”Manhunt: How I Brought Serial Killer Levi Bellfield To Justice, by Colin Sutton, is published by John Blake on Thursday, priced pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"mum reveals how earns cash","story":"NewsMum reveals how she earns cash as a full-time MERMAID after ditching her - jobRosie Palmer, , quit her job as a barber and nail technician to follow her dreams after being in love with mermaids since she was a little girlShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN NewsRosie said she has dreamed of being a mermaid since she was a little girl \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young mum ditched her full-time job to become a mermaid after spending pound, on a silicone fish tail.

At least one was lured to a “raping room” in his flat, it is claimed. A report, compiled by a senior social worker, claims the other six members of the gang are still at large. The report was prepared by Debbie Weissang, previously child sexual exploitation manager at Hillingdon Council in west London. Bellfield, who has converted to Islam in prison and now uses the name Yusuf Rahim, hunted victims in south-west London and Surrey. Detectives believe he targeted some of his victims because he had been turned down by attractive women.

But Edd Munchs painting, The Scream, is also one of the most disturbing and enduringly mysterious. Painted by the Norwegian expressionist artist in , it shows a man walking across a bridge at sunset, holding his head in his hands with a tortured look of horror. The haunting image has been copied and parodied on everything from t-shirts, socks, napkins and The Simpsons. But now the dark secrets of The Scream are set to be revealed in a new exhibition at the British Museum in London. The painting will go on display in April and curator Giulia Bartrum says: We hope to lt the veil on the deeply personal and emotional artworks of the man behind The Scream. But to get you in the mood, here are a few fascinating facts about the artwork...  The Scream isnt one piece, but four Munch also created versions in crayon, pastels and a black and white lithograph.  It may have been based on a Peruvian mummy Around the time it was painted, the mummied figure of a Chachapoyas warrior was discovered near the Utcubamba River in Peru. With hands cemented in place on either side of a mouth open in an apparent shriek, the mummy bears a striking resemblance to Munchs screamer.Art historian Robert Rosenblum posited Munch found inspiration in the mummy while it was on display at an exhibition in Paris.   It inspired the mask of Wes Cravens Scream killer The director of the hit slasher movie franchise counts The Scream as one of his favourite works of art, and has said, Its a classic reference to just the pure horror of parts of the th century, or perhaps just human existence.   It might be about suicide It was painted when Munch was broke, heartbroken at a failed love affair, and fearful of developing the mental illness that ran in his family. The bridge depicted overlooked a fjord in Oslo and was a known suicide spot – within earshot of a slaughterhouse and a mental asylum where Munchs schizophrenic sister resided.  The Scream influenced Doctor Who In the  series, the Doctor first faced off against universe threatening aliens known as the Silence. Executive producer Steven Moffat confessed the look of these terrying creators was inspired in part by Munchs Scream.  Its been stolen twice The first theft happened on the opening day of the  Winter Olympics opened in Lillehammer. Bandits placed a ladder up to the window of the National Gallery in Oslo, slunk inside, and made off with the painting. They were so pleased with the ease of this crime that they added insult to robbery, leaving a note that read, Thanks for the poor security. Thankfully, the painting was recovered within three months.  Armed gunmen stole it again in . In a daring daylight heist, two masked men rushed into Oslos Munch Museum and made off with The Scream and Madonna. By May of , three men had been convicted for the theft. But despite the city of Oslo offering a massive reward, the paintings remained missing. MMs were used as a bargaining toolIn August , Mars, Inc. became involved in the recovery efforts – as a marketing ploy to promote the brands new dark chocolate MMs. Along with an ad that featured the red MM playing hopscotch within the iconic painting, Mars offered up the sweet reward.Just a few days after the promotion started, a convict revealed the whereabouts of the missing paintings during a plea deal, asking for conjugal visits and the . tons of candy. However, Mars decidedanyone would get the prize, it should be the Norwegian authorities who collared the many in the first place. The police decided it would be bestthe cash went to the Munch Museum. We may be scientically wired to respond to The Scream Studies performed by Hard neurobiology professor Margaret Livingstone on macaque monkeys show that the brain is more likely to respond to faces that are exaggerated, like The Screams distended mouth.

Francesca Scott, , was stopped by police at the wheel of her mothers Mini Cooper after a female friend she had been driving home from a night out was spotted slumped in the passenger seat in a drunken stupor. Police asked the businessmans daughter to take a breath test and she was found to to be more than one and a half times the alcohol limit. She was kept in police cells until am when she was allowed to go home to her family. It emerged undergraduate Scott, who lives in a luxury farmhouse in the village of Mottram St-Andrew, near Wilmslow, Cheshire had decided to drive her friend home as a good deed saying she feared the friend would be in dangershe was a lone female in a taxi.   At Stockport Magistrates Court the teenager - who attended the pound,-a-year Cheadle Hulme School before enrolling at Falmouth University in Cornwall - admitted driving with excess alcohol and was disqualied from driving for  months. The incident occurred in Wilmslow on December  while Scott was back home for the Christmas holidays from Falmouth a former art college which now specialises in creative industries and where the Chancellor is comedian Dawn French. Prosecutor Robin Lynch said: This defendant is a lady of good character with no previous convictions on her record. Officers were on mobile patrol in the area of Manchester Road and saw a mini pull of a car park in the town centre. There were a number of off-licence premises around the area.   They pulled that vehicle over and saw a female passenger seemed to be slumped over in the passenger seat asleep, they could smell intoxicant in the vehicle. They were fully compliant at the scene and the defendant was taken to a nearby police station where she provided breath tests. Tests revealed Scott had  microgrammes of alcohol in  mililitres of breath. The legal limit is mg. In mitigation, her lawyer Jon Mail said: She was completely cooperative with police at the scene and at the station.   She is a full time student in Falmouth and was back home over the Christmas period. She had gone to meet some friends from home, she did not intend to drink and was in her mums car. She did have one and a half glasses of wine. Unfortunately, one of her friends was in a bad way and foolishly Miss Scott had offered to give her friend a lt home. She has always been told by her parents not to go in a taxi alone as a female and she made the wrong decision to drive her friend home rather than put her in a taxi. It was a shock to her that she was over the limit. She was put in a cell all night and her parents did not know where she was until  oclock in the morning, the whole experience has been traumatic for her.   Shes always been told by her parents that she should not drive after drinking any alcohol whatsoever, this shows that even a couple of glasses puts you over the limit. Scott was also fined pound.

He reportedly wrote, I didn’t mean to hurt her!, before detailing how Shele fell and the water turned red, according to the New York Post.  “All of these years I have been so incredibly afraid and guilty about the night my mom died,” Covlin is alleged to have written as his daughter.

The -year-old, who shot to social media fame last year thanks to her eye-catching selfies, captioned the image: Broken my neck. She also suggested she wanted to see how many fans would pray well. Sahar, who uploaded the image on Christmas Day, later shared another strange snap showing her peering out from behind a pillar. In the picture, she can be seen with very thin, fake limbs, which have been edited so that they are wrapped around the white structure.   The Iranian star has been likened to Hollywood actress Angelina due to her angular cheekbones, nose and hollow cheeks in her selfies. After going viral, there were claims she had undergone  surgeries and lost  kilos to get her distinctive look and mimic her idol. She attracted a lot of criticism - with some people comparing the young womans looks to Tim Burtons Corpse Bride character. Others doubtedher looks were real, or the result of digital trickery. After causing a flurry of Internet speculation Sahar apparently confirmed she had undergone a number of cosmetic surgeries. But she insisted she never wanted to look like A-lister Angelina. Speaking to Russian website Sputnik News , she said that although she had had some plastic surgeries, including rhinoplasty, liposuction and cosmetic procedures to give her fuller lips, her spooky looks were mostly down to make-up prosthetics and Photoshop.She said: It is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo I make my face more fun. It is my way of self-expression, a kind of art. My followers know that this is not my real face.I had no interest at all to be like Angelina Jolie , and I did not want to look like the character from Corpse Bride.I understand that I do have some similarities with them, but I am my own muse and I did not want to look like anyone.  That was not my aim. Sahar previously took to social media to reveal what she actually looks like - and it couldnt be more dferent from her artwork. In the unedited images, the young woman, from Tehran, looks nothing like her online persona her Instagram fans have come to expect.The pictures are in stark contrast to the recent bizarre hospital and pillar snaps posted on her Instagram page, @sahartabar_official."},{"url":null,"title":"mum insulted after sister law","story":"NewsMum insulted after sister-in-law rips her off with Christmas dinner billA mum is not sure what to do after her sister-in-law has sent a bill of £ per person for a \"basic\" Christmas dinnerShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsShe doesnt think it adds up\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNow that were well into January, many of us are fondly remembering the festivities of a couple of weeks ago.

Writing on Mumsnet, she said: My [sister-in-law] said she would host Christmas this year as she has a big new house and plenty of room for us all. I askedI should bring something and she said she would just do a shop and split the cost. She did suggest we bring our own alcohol. I thought it was a little odd, as did my hubby but he reminded me that she was cheap and the food wouldnt cost that much anyway! Best to just agree with it instead of making a fuss. Anyway we had Christmas, I took up  bottles of wine .Left them there when we left. We were given cereal for breakfast and tinned soup for lunch and a basic Christmas dinner. No puddings and just a little cheese for dessert.  We just got the bill... it came to pound each! [Am I being unreasonable] to feel angry and insulted by this all  It doesnt seem right to hand over money. Especially to family. Also I feel really ripped off!I dont want to upset my husband, but his family are a new level of cheap. If I did that to my brother, he probably wouldnt speak to me again! The post received over  comments, and people on the parenting forum were ided over the matter. Some thought the mum should cough up what was previously agreed and others said it seemed like way too much for what they had.One wrote: pound each is crazy, I wouldnt want to pay that, suggesting a breakdown of the costs.Another agreed: Id demand back the wine, then! Others expressed their disbelief at the cost of pound per person, particularly as it didnt include alcohol, dessert or other extras, and slammed the sister-in-law as cheeky and a cheapskate.A few Mumsnet users reckon the mum should pay up, given that they had agreed to split the cost before.One wrote: Seems odd to me, but you agreed to it beforehand, so you should pay. I think that asking for a breakdown of the bill is going to cause more trouble than it’s worth! The mum posted again to say that she plans to pay but will make her excusesinvited again next year.

All of the cheese collects inside the grater for you to then sprinkle as desired, so its a much tidier process with less random strands falling off and making a big old mess.

The parents were out at the time of the odd incident, but their children were inside the house sleeping. They claim they werent woken up by Arroyo but later came across footage of the whole thing on their security system and called the police. Sylvia Dungan was left feeling concerned by the experience - but admitted she was relieved things didnt get any worse on the night. She told KION: You kind of laugh about it afterwards because, technically, he didnt harm anybody, he didnt break anything.

The series of operations for their separation has been dubbed “Operation Freedom” and they are being looked after by the Hungarian team of Action for Defenceless People Foundation. Rabeya and Rokayah arrived in the European country on Saturday for diagnostic and preparatory examinations needed for the final operation which plans to separate their skull.They will have special plastic surgery which involves the implantation of tissue expanders.  A spokesman for the Hungarian Action for Defenceless People Foundation said: The first step of the three-stage surgery series, the separation of the conjoined vascular system of the twins’ brains, was carried out successfully with a so-called endovascular method by Dr. Istvan Hudak, neurosurgeon, during two operations at Dhaka Medical College Department of Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery in Bangladesh in February and August . The arrival of the twins to Hungary was preceded by serious consideration, which resulted in the conclusion that the procedure of the expander insertion must be carried out under the best conditions from the medical point of view, using the most effective tools and devices possible.  He added: The plastic surgical part of the operation is coordinated by Dr. Gergely Pataki, Hungarian plastic surgeon along with a team of plastic surgeons from Dhaka Medical College.The “major surgery” of the final separation of the brain and skull will be led by Dr. Andras Csokay PhD, neurosurgeon of the Foundation, and that must be prepared by thorough examinations. Surgeons had previously warned they would have to wait two years before making a final decision on going ahead with the risky procedure.  Parents Taslima Khatun Uno and Mohammed, both teachers, didn’t learn that the twins were conjoined until after their birth. They were delivered by caesarean and spent two weeks in intensive care. Taslima said: “For their future it’s necessary to separate the girls – they are not having a healthy le. “If I don’t separate them now maybe in future they will ask why I didn’t separate them ” "},{"url":null,"title":"blether dundee boss bob shankly motored to aberdeen to sign john scott","story":"Jocky Scott is, rightly, a legend at Dens Park.

The aim is to play football regularly with the goal of helping United reach the Premiership and hopefully secure a longer deal.#Neilson said: #Aidan is someone I know well. I paid money to take him to MK Dons and his first season was excellent.#It hasn#t worked for him under a new manager down there, but I see him as the type of creative player who can help us produce more in the final third of the park.#Another possible target is midfielder Ian Harkes, who was recently released by MLS side DC United, where he’s been a team-mate of Wayne Rooney.Harkes, , is the son of former USA international John and qualies to play in this country because he was born in England during his father’s time with Derby County.By next week they could also be joined by former Tangerines favourite Morgaro Gomis. The  Scottish Cup winner has been training with the squad since hisfrom a spell in the Middle East.Other than -year-old Gomis, the manager has refused to identy any potential signings until deals are complete.Nesbitt#s arrival will move striker Craig Curran closer to a switch to team up with his former boss, Jim McIntyre, at Dundee.The Liverpudlian has not been a regular starter since switching from Ross County in the summer and, while he’s in contention for a place tomorrow,United make the signings they want, he’s likely to be allowed to go.“There’s interest in quite a few of the players and, obviously, Jim’s got a big relationship with Craig and we’ll see how that goes in the next few weeks,” said Robbie.“I really like Craig, he’ll be involved with us tomorrow and ultimately time will tell.”A number of players have already been told they are no longer part of the plans. Until departures are confirmed, Robbie would not name names.It’s believed, though, that one of them is defender-cum-midfielder Adam Barton, while winger Yannick Loemba is another who’s not likely to be seen again in tangerine.Since Robbie took charge in October, former Jag Barton has had just  minutes of game time via two sub appearances.He’s set to move back to England where he’s spent most of his career.Loemba’s time on the pitch has been even more limited under the new boss and amounts to a four-minute appearance against Inverness in October.Like Barton, the Congolese-born Belgian passport holder only arrived in the summer.

It all gets used one way or another.”"},{"url":null,"title":"north east communitys christmas display raises 7600 for play area for kids with special needs","story":"A north-east community#s Christmas display has raised a whopping £, towards a new playground for children with special needs.Big-hearted residents in Stonehaven’s Malcolm’s Way have made it an annual tradition to deck out their homes with festive lights and invited donations from generous passers-by.This year the money is going Friends of Carronhill School, which plans to use the money to purchase equipment which would allow children with special needs the chance to play in a “safer environment”.The Friends group is hoping to raise a total of £, for a wheelchair-accessible playground at Carronhill School.In less than three weeks, the Malcolm’s Way residents were able to raise £,., which is enough to fund a sensory board.Carolyn McCombie, , one of the parents on the fundraising committee for Friends of Carronhill School, said: “It’s just absolutely brilliant.“The fundraising is a huge help for the playground and we are excited that Malcolm’s Way residents have chosen us once again as their charity.”Praise for north-east street after Christmas display raises thousands for charity\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local praise-for-north-east-street-after-christmas-display-raises-thousands-for-charity embed # secretXCebmHwTzC\" data-secret\"XCebmHwTzC\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Praise for north-east street after Christmas display raises thousands for charity# # Evening Express\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The group is also looking to get a wheelchair-friendly swing installed, which could cost up to £,, along with a wheelchair-friendly roundabout costing £,.Carolyn said: “Because of the help from Malcolm’s Way we have had a lot of attention.“We’re hoping to also get some funding from Cash For Kids as well.

It was a complicated sequence to film and Jon turned to Scorsese for advice on the best way to shoot it.The pair first met when Jon was hired to direct an episode of US television series Vinyl, which Scorsese produced.Jon – a huge fan of Scorsese’s  film The King of Comedy – said: “The thing that really benefitted me in my career, and still is, is my relationship with Mr Scorsese. That’s been the greatest thing to come out of my work in television in the States and the doors that has opened for me.“We spoke about the backlot shot and he advised on some of the lens choices and how to co-ordinate the background artists because he’s the master of that – the modern master anyway of those long shots.”Scorsese’s admiration of Stan  Ollie is no secret – to the extent he hosted a special screening in New York just before Christmas with Jon and the cast.“He’s seen Stan  Ollie and loves the film,” said Jon.“He’s really supported it and helped it. He’s a very good mentor, probably the best mentor to have. I go and see him every time I’m in New York.“It’s quite an unusual thing for somebody who comes from a small fishing town to end up having that. It’s a real dream come true.” vw, px\"  Jon says dreams of a le in showbiz were not something he contemplated growing up in Peterhead – orhe did he kept them to himself.He said: “My mother was a nurse and was a stay-at-home mum and looked after us very well.“My dad was in construction and neither of them went to university or had any particular interest in the arts.“But we would go to London every year to visit my uncle and we’d go to see musical theatre and that was the highlight of the year for me.“We watched things like Oliver! My Fair Lady and Cats, and I think that was what sparked my interest in this kind of world. Before film, really.“If you told anyone in Peterhead you wanted to be a film director, they would have thought you were a bit mad.“I didn’t really tell anybody what I wanted to do until I moved away.”Although he applied to film school, he didn’t get in, blaming his grades and the times he “messed about” at Peterhead Academy.“My grades weren’t great at the academy,” said Jon.“Education didn’t seem to be the most important thing.“My career didn’t start until I moved down to London and started as a runner – basically a teaboy – and worked my way up.”In , he directed parts of the short-lived BBC satire The State We’re In, which featured an early appearance by John Oliver, now the star of award-winning HBO comedy Last Week Tonight.Jon said: “John Oliver was a writer no one had heard of and I was directing his inserts. I wasn’t doing that well, he wasn’t doing that well.“Cut to  years later, maybe more, and I switched on the TV and there was John on HBO with his own show. I was at the premiere of Vinyl, which was a show I did at HBO, and he was there too. I went up to him and we reminisced about the times we couldn’t get arrested for work.”After making his directorial debut in  with a short film called It’s A Casual Le, Jon made the biopic Cass in , about the le of writer and football hooligan Cass Pennant, then adapted the Irvine Welsh novel Filth for the big screen in .But even as his films get bigger in scope – Stan  Ollie is his largest budget yet – Jon says the homegrown support is something he’s never taken for granted.He said: “I’ve had a massive amount of support from people in the north-east towards my career.“I get texts from people I haven’t seen in years saying we’ve seen what you’re doing and we’re really proud of you and that means more than anything.“I still consider it my home and who I really am. So regardless ofI didn’t have the background in, or the family connections in film, I still feel as though, weirdly enough,I hadn’t grown up in the north-east, I might not have ended up with this career.“I might have ended up in something  purely because it was foreign from what I was used to, it was the big draw to go into the unknown.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c344c7d913229.94964839-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"passengers tell of panic after aborted landings at aberdeen airport1","story":"Passengers were left in mid-air panic when a wind-battered plane twice abandoned landing attempts during weather chaos in the north-east.Children cried and adults vomited after the plane came within feet of the runway at Aberdeen International Airport, before sharply pulling up and speeding off.It came on a day where strong winds led to power cuts and caused delays and cancellations for rail customers, ferry passengers and drivers.The strongest wind speed, which was mph, was recorded in Peterhead Harbour.At Aberdeen International Airportthe wind reached mph and in Aboyne it was mph.The flight from Heathrow to AIA was one of two that twice abandoned landing attempts at the city airport yesterday afternoon before erting to Edinburgh due to gale-force winds.Once in the capital, passengers were told to wait for around  minutes – but the pilot decided it was too risky to attempt to fly back to Aberdeen and all passengers were taken by bus to the Granite City.Councillor Hamish Partridge, who represents Troup ward in Aberdeenshire, was ing from a family cruise in the Caribbean and had flown to the USA then to Heathrow, before boarding a flight to Aberdeen which was due to land around pm – before things went wrong.Mr Partridge said the plane attempted to land once and failed, so then tried again.“There were strong winds and the plane just bounced from one side to the other and twisted and turned on approach.“We must have been feet from the tar – or it felt that way looking out of the window – when full power was put on and the plane pulled out of the landing attempt.”He added: “There were a lot of tears and panic all over the plane.“A lot of passengers were sick and kids were crying.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup.

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant.

But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook.

And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails.

It defines the phenomenon as ldquoactions that interfere with a womanrsquos reproductive intentions and any actions that pressurise a woman into initiating or terminating pregnancy.Primarily carried out by intimate partners, it can also be perpetrated by the wider family and in organised crime, with young people and ethnic minorities particularly vulnerable.Actions include emotional blackmail, threats of violence, pressure to continue or end apregnancy or to not use certain types of contraception.It also includes ldquocontraceptive sabotage, such as a male partner ly saying they have had a vasectomy, piercing condoms before use, or ldquostealthing, where a condom is covertly removed during sex.Some women may not have insight into their relationship, especiallythere is no physical or sexual violence, as they may become inured to the control being exerted on them.Describing how it could manest, Mr Rowlands said: ldquoI think it is like a spectrum, at the worst extreme end there probably is violence and extreme things going on like food deprivation, on the other end itrsquos really just a kind of psychologically controlling atmosphere ndash keeping tabs on everything the woman is doing, maybe being restrictive over when she goes out.However, Mr Rowlands said that, for many women, the issue was not being raised during consultations. He said there were no UK guidelines or advice for health professionals, the majority of whom ldquowere not terribly aware and would not be thinking about raising this.Health professionals who were conscious of it were responding on an inidual basis to inidual patients, he said.The report is calling for screening to take place in maternity, sexual and reproductive health and abortion services and GP surgeries, with a set of questions already devised.Professionals should be alert to its possibility.

The group has vowed to keep them running for the foreseeable future, with a community-spirited local cleaner and a couple of helpers stepping in to provide their services free of charge.The situation is far from unique. Research published in this newspaper last month showed that across Scotland the number of public toilets has reduced by  per cent in the past five years, with a third of the  that remain expected to be sold off or closed in the coming months. In towns and villages across the country solutions are being found, with local authorities paying small sums to local businesses infor public access to their facilities in a so-called lsquocomfort partnershiprsquo arrangement.As in my home town, other community groups have taken full responsibility for their local loos, with the Cumbrae Community Development Company - aka The Cumbrae Cludgies - proving just how successful community ownership can be after taking over management of the islandrsquos six public toilets in .

Consigning the elderly or infirm to their homes rather than finding ways of ensuring they can remain a part of the community is hardly the mark of a civilised society.And that, really, is the crux: far from being a simple inconvenience, the loss of public lavatories serves as a reminder of just how uncivilised our society has become. From streets smeared with dog dirt to towns left without libraries, the symptoms are everywhere.

Wersquove decided to take a look at the Englishmanrsquos stats to see exactly what Rangers fans can expect from their new man.Defoe has always been seen as a natural goalscorer and with  goals in the English Premier League itrsquos not hard to see why. The ex-Spurs striker is the seventh-highest goalscorer in the competitionrsquos history and has spent almost the entirety of his career in Englandrsquos top flight.The graphic above charts Defoersquos goals per  minutes in league football since the   season and the results make for impressive reading. Even during the forwardrsquos worst season in front of goal, in  , he was still averaging . goals per  mins, or around a goal every four gamesyoursquod prefer. This is hardly prolic, of course, but it isnrsquot a poorin such a demanding league.:The Bulletin: Gerrard Further signings depend on moving players on | Hibernian keen on Lewis MorganPerhaps unsurprisingly, Defoersquos best goalscoring campaign came in the   season when he was playing for MLS side Toronto but of the  seasons hersquos spent in Englandrsquos top flight, Defoe has averaged more than a goal every two games on seven occasions. Even as recently as  , the forward was scoring . goals per  - a figure not to be snfed at.By analysing Defoersquos scoring rate over the last  seasons, we can see that there are peaks and troughs but - much to the encouragement of Rangers fans - there is no sustained period of clear decline. Yes, Defoersquos goalscoring rate has dropped in the last two seasons but there are a couple of mitigating factors here. Firstly, that during   Defoe was tasked with banging in the goals for a truly dreadful Sunderland side that looked destined for relegation from the opening day. And secondly, that last season at Bournemouth he was a bit-part player, often coming off the bench and rarely given a run in Eddie Howersquos starting XI.If we take Defoersquos average goals per  minutes over the last three seasons as a representative sample, the figure we arrive at is .. Itrsquos important to point out that these are goals scored in the English Premier League, where the standard is higher than the Scottish Premiership, yet even going by these numbers it appears Defoe will have plenty to offer to Rangers during his time at Ibrox.:Rangers boss Steven Gerrard calls for respect to be shown towards referees after Old Firm fall outA more in-depth look at Defoersquos numbers reveals that the veteran strikerrsquos role has been changing in recent seasons. Where Defoe has traditionally been characterised as a goalscorer, we can see that as age catches up with the -year-old, his style of play has evolved.We can see that Defoersquos goalscoring has dropped signicantly - particularly last season when he wasnrsquot featuring regularly for Bournemouth - but other aspects of his game have actually improved in recent campaigns. While the English forward is scoring fewer goals and hitting fewer shots, his accuracy has increased to the point where the majority of his efforts on goal are on target.Interestingly, Defoersquos expected goalshas remained fairly consistent during this time, implying that hersquos still being given the same number and quality of goalscoring opportunities during any given match, but hersquos converting fewer of them. This may be slightly worrying for Rangers supporters, but they can take heart from the fact that Defoersquos team play has improved over the same period. The number of key passes - passes that lead directly to a shot - that Defoe averages more than doubled last season and the number of touches that hersquos taking in the opposition box has also risen.Defoersquos dribbling has suffered at the same time, however, with the number of attempted dribbles per  minutes dropping from . to . and with good reason in  , around % of the forwardrsquos dribbles were successful, but that figure plummeted to % last season.All in all, then, it looks as though Defoe still has plenty to offer and should prove to be an important player for Rangers during the second half of the season. Gerrard has already asserted that Defoe is ldquoa very young -year-old and that the striker ldquohas a shape to die for in terms of how he looks after himself in response to questions about age creeping up on the forward. The stats suggest that, naturally for a player Defoersquos age, there has been a drop-off in some aspects of his game, but his goalscoring record throughout his career suggests that he wonrsquot struggle to find the net this season.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

August  Late on the evening of Thursday August , news first emerged in the Daily Record that Mr Salmond had been reported to the police over allegations of sexual harassment against him. : Alex Salmond harassment claims - what we know so farThe tabloid wrote: “The former SNP leader has been accused of carrying out an attack on one of the female employees in the First Minister’s official Edinburgh residence in December .”August  Even as the political world reeled from the news of the investigation, Mr Salmond initiated legal proceedings against the Scottish Government, lodging a submission for a judicial review against the decision to disclose the complaints and the way they were investigated. : Nicola Sturgeon backs civil servant in Alex Salmond caseIn a statement, Mr Salmond wrote: “The procedure as put into operation by the Permanent Secretary is grossly unfair and therefore inevitably will lead to prejudicial outcomes.“It is therefore with great reluctance that I have today launched a Judicial Review in the Court of Session which will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure which has been used against me.”August  Statements by both Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon dominate the news agenda, as the First Minister says that while personally dficult for her, the allegations ‘could not be ignored’, while Mr Salmond used a BBC interview to say: “I have made many mistakes in my le, political and personal.: Alex Salmond statement in full“But I have not sexually harassed anyone and I certainly have not been engaged in criminality.”The First Minister echoed the comments of Leslie Evans when she told the same network: “The Scottish government refutes his criticisms of its process and will defend its position vigorously.”August Further details of the allegations are published in the Daily Record, which claims to have seen the official wording of a complaint, and reported that a woman alleged Salmond instructed her to join him in his bedroom and offered her alcohol, which she repeatedly refused. The newspaper went goes on to report that he asked her to get into bed with him before lying on top of her, kissing her and touching her bottom and breasts through her clothes.August  Mr Salmond announced that he had resigned his membership of the SNP, the party he lead during some of the most signicant moments in Scottish political history.The former leader also launched a crowdfunding appeal to help finance the action he was taking against the Scottish Government, reaching a £k target in a matter of hours. September The Scottish Government formally noties the Court of Session, the highest court in the land, that it intends to contest the judicial review brought against it by Mr Salmond, confirming again that it will ‘vigorously’ defend its position. November The case is called in court for the first time, in what is known as a ‘procedural hearing’. January Mr Salmond wins in court after a judge rules that the actions of the Scottish Government are unlawful. He calls for the resignation of Leslie Evans and warns that the cost to the public purse could rise as high as £,. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852565.1546853225!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon brexit strengthens case for scottish independence","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The case for Scottish independence has been #materially strengthened# by Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon has claimed as the UK government battles to save the Prime Minister#s deal with the EU.The First Minister said she hoped to be able to unveil her timetable for a second independence referendum “very soon”, renewing speculation that she will issue a demand for a fresh vote on Scotland’s future in the weeks ahead.And she attacked Jeremy Corbyn for refusing to embrace another referendum on Brexit, calling on the Labour leader to “get off the fence”.Her comments came as MPs ed to Westminster following the Christmas break with little sign of progress in convincing Conservative rebels to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Opposition parties rallied behind a plan to make delivery of a no-deal Brexit impossible by amending key financial legislation, in a bid to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement.Meanwhile, critics blasted a test of plans to deal with gridlock around the UK’s Channel ports in the event of no-deal as a farce, after the government gathered half the number of lorries it said it needed for the exercise at an airfield in Kent.Speaking to the BBC, Ms Sturgeon claimed Scotland’s interests were being “completely ignored and sidelined” and that what has happened in the past two years has reinforced the case for it to leave the UK.Ms Sturgeon would not be drawn on timings around an independence referendum, but insisted the SNP had a mandate to call an independence referendum before the next Holyrood election.: Playing a waiting game on IndyRef is dangerous for SNP“Everything that has happened over the past couple of years, from Scotland facing exit from the EU against our will to every reasonable attempt at compromise to protect Scotland’s interests by the Scottish Government being spurned, to the powers of the Scottish Parliament being eroded, to the UK government even taking the Scottish Government to court, all of that has strengthened and reinforced the case for Scotland to be independent, because these are not just academic arguments, all of this will have a material impact on Scotland’s economy and well-being for ­decades to come,” Ms Sturgeon said. “The case for independence is materially strengthened from an already strong base in  because of all of the experience of Scotland in the last two years. We were told in  that it was voting for independence that would put in peril our membership of the European Union.“Because we didn’t vote for independence, we now not just find ourselves facing exit, the voice and the interests of Scotland are being completely ignored and sidelined.”Ms Sturgeon said there is “clearly no majority” to crash out of the EU without a deal and that holding another referendum on Brexit should be the alternative.She said: “I hope the meaningful vote does go ahead next week so that MPs can once and for all say that they don’t support the Withdrawal Agreement, and then the House of Commons can coalesce behind the alternative, and in my view that alternative now should be to have another EU referendum. I don’t take for granted that there is a majority for that, but the SNP will be part of building that majority.”Turning her fire on the Labour leader, Ms Sturgeon added: “I think there’s a big question for Jeremy Corbyn now: is he going to get off the fence and actually do what the majority of his own party members want him to do, which is back a second referendum ”Mrs May’s official spokesman accused the First Minister of “sowing the politics of ision” and said the Prime Minister was focused on delivering her Brexit deal.Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw called on the SNP leader to abandon her “obsession” with independence.“Today Scots are heading back to work at the beginning of a new year, but Nicola Sturgeon is stuck in the past,” Mr Carlaw said. “As at the start of , , , and  her priority is to rerun the referendum of . People across the country will correctly be thinking, ‘There she goes again’.“The best new year’s resolution the SNP could make would be to drop the independence obsession and concentrate on delivering for the people of Scotland.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said “one of the experiences of Brexit has been just how dficult and painful it can be to break away from a union, even one that has been place for just  years”.Mr Leonard added: “A union that has been in place for  years would, in my view, cause considerable economic disruption and there is no appetite from the people of Scotland for it.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie claimed the SNP “appear to have learned absolutely nothing from Brexit”, adding: “Breaking up is hard to do.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday. A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"creative project manager at shetland arts ","story":"Shetland Arts are seeking a Creative Project Manager to help drive forward our vision of a creative, connected Shetland that values art, culture and creativity, and the positive impact it can have on everyone’s le.The Creative Project Manager will be responsible for delivering a strategy that supports and inspires creative practice, formal and informal learning, outreach, performance, exhibition and programming opportunities throughout Shetland.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27512  ","story":"The attack at Burntollet Bridge. Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which commands the authority to make and keep agreements, and embrace and deliver change.Those who marched from Belfast to Derry fty years ago this week were a microcosm of the wider CRM.They were students and others, including, republicans, social democrats, communists, socialists, trade unionists, and labour members.

The North Antrim DUP MP told the News Letter that the “continuous campaign of terror” waged by the IRA had “stunted the economic growth” of Northern Ireland.“It is convenient for nationalists to ignore this as their ideology benighted from its consequences,” he added. “Despite the  years of terror, NI has survived, now boasts the lowest levels of unemployment in our history, the highest levels of inward investment outside of London and is a hub for many key businesses. Nationalism survives on a dialogue of talking down NI hence I am not surprised by such comments.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8762003.1546953788!/image/image.jpg","title":"tree mendous recycling efforts","story":"The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim has thanked residents who are #treecycling# after Christmas.In the run-up to the festive season, the council encouraged citizens to recycle unwanted items and responsibly dispose of all waste, including Christmas trees.And Mayor Lindsay Millar said she has been impressed by the number of people visiting Household Recycling Centres in order for their trees to be turned into high-quality compost for our parks and gardens in Mid and East Antrim.Cllr.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Not initially aware of his good fortune, the two cash-strapped women learn that their patient won’t be around for long and are then faced with a moral dilemma of should they or shouldn’t they… Long time Marie Jones collaborator Katie Tumelty told Daily Belfast how the play has a “universal voice” in its themes that are as prevalent today as when the play was first performed back in .“This play deals with the working woman, in this case two care workers who are running to and from the people that they care for on a daily basis,” she said. “Their work is invaluable to so many families but in the cases of Frances and Loretta there is more going on behind the scenes. Marie’s play deals with poverty, death and dilemma but at the same time has so much humour running throughout it.“Both characters are hard workers, they have stresses in work, stresses at home and they are just trying to make ends meet and get through their working day.

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

Or, more accurately, David Stitt BSc Hons is on Twitter. Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest . A Military Operation, being constructed by Structural Engineers for safety.” Across the Pravince, men of substance nodded slowly and gravely and gave thanks that the health and safety of the children of the large estate is in such professional hands. Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

We’ll be going on strike for the exact same reason.“Ireland’s patients deserve better than this understaffed health service.“Nurses and midwives are now globally traded assets.“The public health service no longer pays a competitive wage, so we can no longer get the necessary number of nurses and midwives.“We are calling on the public to support us. Nurses and midwives are always there for you when you need help. Now we need your help.”The Minister for Health Simon Harris said he does not believe industrial action is “warranted” and could be avoided.The minister said there is a “clear need for engagement and it is essential that the time is used by all sides to find a resolution to this dispute”.He added that health sector management will invite the INMO to meet with them next week.A spokeswoman for the HSE said: “Whilst we acknowledge the right of staff to engage in industrial action, the HSE is disappointed at the decision of the INMO to commence industrial action. “Industrial action at any time is severely disruptive in the health service, but is even more so at this time, given the demands and pressures that currently exist in all areas of service delivery within the health services.”The spokeswoman added that the HSE will contact the INMO to try and have the “unnecessary industrial action averted”. “However, industrial action can only occur within the terms of the Public Service Pay Agreement, which has been accepted by all parties including the INMO,” it added."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services called after car reverses into cafe window","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He again made this call as the British Government confirmed the next stage of the universal credit rollout is to be scaled back. The Ballyarnett councillorsaid: “The SDLP has been consistently clear that scaling back Universal Credit is not good enough. Its roll out must be halted until there is urgent and radical reform, not least when it comes to the minimum five week wait for first payment and the two child rule. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“The delay in moving people onto Universal Credit is an admission by the Tory Government that this system is flawed and is causing hurt and hardship, but this delay does not protect people. In effect it means more people are likely to lose out and be worse off as they are left to move on to Universal Credit under managed migration or premature migration where they will automatically lose the premiums they are currently receiving and rely on to make ends meet.“It is also interesting to hear parties like Sinn Féin who, along with the DUP and Alliance, voted to enable the introduction of Universal Credit in the north call for it to be scrapped. Placards and press releases won’t protect people from this cruel and flawed system. People need and deserve to have an Executive and Assembly that takes real and meaningful action to tackle the failings of this cruel system.\""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/9265082.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Emergency services called after car reverses into cafe windowAccidentSecond man charged in Texas over drive-by killing of girl, sevenAccident\"\"\"DR Congo opposition leader says election commission is ‘playing with fire’Accident\"\"\"Decision to settle Salmond legal challenge deeply regrettable, says SturgeonAccident\"\"\"Tory MPs rebel as Government suffers defeat over no-deal Brexit tax powersAccident\"\"\"Union will recommend rejection of revised local authority pay offerAccident\" class\"lazy\" style\"display: block min-height: rem\" data-iesrc\" .jpg htypetypenile-list\"\"\"\"Royal guards play Bohemian Rhapsody after Queen film wins big at Golden GlobesAccident\"\"\"Serco loses asylum housing contract in Scotland after lock change rowAccident\"\"\"Council to consider action over new plaque on Omagh bomb memorialAccident\"\"\"HGV driver held after woman and boy, , killed in motorway crashAccident\"\"\"Heathrow flights grounded after drone sightingAccident\"\"\"Sinn Fein councillor being subjected to abuse at meetings, vice president claimsAccident\"\"\"Eleven pet French bulldogs stolen from homeAccident\"\"\"Girl ‘made video of father coaching her to lie about assault’Accident\"\"\"Stormont ‘veto’ on post-Brexit trade rules unacceptable, says Sinn FeinAccident\"\"\"Sturgeon urged to publish details of talks with Salmond during complaints probeAccident\"\"\"Kegworth disaster families and survivors mark  years since plane crashAccident\"\"\"Excess winter deaths tally in Northern Ireland has more than doubled since Accident\"\"\"Protester repeats claim MP Anna Soubry is a Nazi in Facebook postsAccident\"\"\"‘Staggering’ rise in AE patients waiting more than four hoursAccident\"\"\"Man fatally shot by police died from single gunshot wound to chestAccident\"\"\"Tom Hanks to present letime award to Alan AldaAccident\"\"\"Five taken to hospital after bus crashes with car at Bathgate roundaboutAccident\"\"\" dead as winter storm blasts EuropeAccident\"\"\"Cambridge Analytica faces trial for ignoring data request enforcement noticeAccident\"\"\"Police to step up Westminster security ahead of Brexit vote after MPs harassedAccident\"\"\"Explained: Former chief prosecutor on Parliament, protests and policeAccident\"\"\"Millions more homes needed to tackle social housing crisis – reportAccident\"\"\"Cuts to previously protected council services inevitable, Cosla warnsAccident\"\"\"Motorhome among four stolen vehicles worth £, in totalAccident\"\"\"Veterans accused of minor offences should be protected, lawyer saysAccident\"\"\"Use of electric cars too low for Scotland to meet  target – LabourAccident\"\"\"Abellio could be stripped of ScotRail contract, says Transport SecretaryAccident\"\"\"Police investigation under way after taxi collides with train at level crossingAccident\"\"\"Salmond case could discourage future complaints, opposition politicians warnAccident\"\"\"Would-be bank robber wearing black furry hat ‘was aged over ’Accident\"\"\"Skripals’ former home ‘to be dismantled’ in post-Novichok deep cleanAccident\"\"\"Transport Secretary Grayling should resign over Brexit ferry contract – LabourAccident\"\"\"Police appeal for man who may have information on Glasgow assaultAccident\" class\"lazy\" style\"display: block min-height: rem\" data-iesrc\" .jpg htypetypenile-list\"\"\"\"Norwegian becomes ‘first budget airline’ with free WiFi on long-haul flightsAccident\"\"\"Romanian stabbed as five men attacked in houseAccident\"\"\"Ayrshire ‘institution’ to close with  jobs lost at department storeAccident\"\"\"Garda excavate land as part of missing person investigationAccident\"\"\"Minister says sorry after claiming Tories introduced the National Minimum WageAccident\"\"\"Alex Salmond calls for top civil servant to quit after ‘humiliation’ in courtAccident\"\"\"Football coach facing sex abuse trial killed in road crashAccident\"\"\"History will take dim view of ministersthey allow no-deal Brexit, says RuddAccident\"\"\"No-deal Brexit should not be contemplated, says Business SecretaryAccidentGet involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are in contact with the company to have it muted ASAP!” said Carla with the hashtags #depressing #santaisnotcomingtotown.A spokesperson for the council said soon after that they can confirm the music will be switched off that day.It caused uproar on social media with some agreeing with the MLA and others furious that she had little to do.However, veteran councillor Arnold Hatch believes she was out of touch with the community and business.Cllr Hatch, who is involved with Portadown Chamber of Commerce, asked: “What authority had Carla Lockhart to ask the Council to switch of the Christmas music two days before the contract ended “I think it is preposterous from someone who is not a councillor or a Director of ABC council to demand such action,” Alderman Hatch said.“I will be demanding answers from Council officials when theyto work on Monday.“I understand the complaint came from Lurgan, yet the music in Portadown was turned off too,” said Alderman Hatch.

This included piped music in Lurgan and Portadown which was to finish on  th January .“I want to know how many complaints there were, who took note of the complaint and who authorised the music to cease.“I certainly received no complaints from Portadown Chamber of Commerce. In fact, many agreed it helped to create a Festive atmosphere in the run up to Christmas and through to the January sales,” Ald Hatch said.Asked for a response Ms Lockhart said: “I think he will findhe speaks with businesses and people who live in the town centre he will get a very strong feel for the frustration caused by the music playing from early morning to pm at night one week after Christmas. Music was not the issue but the choice and I would have thought Council would have adopted the music repertoire after Christmas. “Mr Hatch has known me for a long time and can call me at any stage to discuss how elected reps conduct themselves. In his investigations he will find that the Lurgan Mail used the word ‘demand’ and I simply asked would Council consider turning the music off given that businesses and residents were frustrated.They informed me that they too had received calls in relation to it and they then obliged,” she claimed.try catch            ..

We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
