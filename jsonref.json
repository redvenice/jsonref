He spent a month photographing the country and then returned to the US on several other trips. In this picture, Mr Carnicelli captured a young boy in Chicago leaning against a signpost at the moment a green bus marked \u0027INDIANA\u0027 passes by in 1966          When Mr Carnicelli (pictured in New York in 1966) returned to Italy after his first trip to the US, he showcased his photographs in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027          His new book says he named that exhibition  because he \u0027felt almost like an intruder in a society completely new to him\u0027. A group of construction workers are pictured giving directions in New York in 1966          He went on to become a freelance photojournalist who worked with several Italian newspapers and magazines and traveled around the world until he retired from photography in the early 1970s.  A retired trade union worker is pictured in Detroit in 1966    Mr Carnicelli (pictured today) tells DailyMail.com that he \u0027felt as if I were living in another dimension\u0027 when he first visited the US in 1966. \u0027I was captivated by the carefree spirit and the freedom that America offered with its mix of cultures and traditions,\u0027 he saysHe adds: \u0027America is a state of mind. Telling it is easy and difficult at the same time. Behind that opulent face, it has many others all of them true, all of them deeply meaningful.\u0027 The images also showed the sadness and loneliness juxtaposed with the American Dream from his European perspective. He realized America was far more complex than he had expected and, when he returned to Italy, Mr Carnicelli showcased the images in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027. His book says he felt he was trespassing in a place that was unfamiliar to him.\u0027Looking back now, it was as if I wanted to apologize for what I had recorded as a photographer,\u0027 Mr Carnicelli says. \u0027I did feel like an intruder investigating a new society at that time.\u0027After that first trip to the US, he returned to the US several times and photographed cities including New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Dallas and San Francisco.He was able to capture men resting against a wall as they wait in line at a job center in Chicago, a man selling newspapers in New York, a trade union worker wearing a colorful hat and jewelry in Detroit, the impatient looks of people in phone booths at O\u0027Hare International Airport in Chicago, people resting on benches at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC and Neo-Nazis demonstrating in Dallas.\u0027The images come very naturally,\u0027 he says. \u0027I did not have to look for them, they just showed up.\u0027            Mr Carnicelli had decided to put his camera down to open his own photography business, where he developed and printed photos in Florence. This schoolboy was photographed by Mr Carnicelli in 1966 in New York          While he worked on his business, Mr Carnicelli\u0027s own photographs ended up being stored in his cellar for 50 years before they were rediscovered last year. Men are pictured leaning against a wall and waiting in line at a job center in Chicago in 1966          He closed his store back in 2010 and asked curator Bärbel Reinhard to look at the negatives he had tucked away. As she looked through the images, she found thousands of images from the \u002760s and \u002770s, including the ones he took of the US - including this photo, showing people walking past the South Pacific Restaurant on an evening in Chicago in 1966          His photographs from his visits to the US are being published for the first time this month in a new book, American Voyage. A black \u002767 Plymouth Belvedere is pictured in Brooklyn in 1967Mr Carnicelli\u0027s family ran a photography equipment business when he was growing up, so it wasn\u0027t a surprise that he started taking photographs himself. He went on to work as a freelance photojournalist for Italian newspapers and magazines including Panorama, Corriere della Sera and Il Giorno.He traveled around the world for his work and even had several exhibitions of his work in the \u002760s and \u002770s. However, by the early 1970s, he decided to retire from photography and open a photo development and printing business in Florence, following in his family\u0027s footsteps.Thousands of his photographs, including those he took on his visits to the US, were stored away in his cellar and forgotten for 50 years until they were rediscovered by curator Bärbel Reinhard last year.

This is not possible. Photography is subjective, the image does not belong to who takes it, it belongs to the viewer who gives it their own interpretation.\u0027American Voyage, published by Reel Art Press, will be released this month. An accompanying exhibition at the David Hill Gallery in London opened on April 20 and will run through June 8.          According to The Guardian, Mr Carnicelli took this photograph of a man in front of a shop window displaying nurses\u0027 uniforms just outside New York.

Windows on commercial planes typically have three panes - outer, middle and inner - made of acrylic and glass.The fact that just the outer pane broke is evidence that the window was acting as designed. In fact, it\u0027s that little hole at the bottom of the outside pane that regulates how much pressure from the cabin is exerted onto the window and makes sure that if the window is going to break - the outer pane goes first.\u0027The way they are designed, the window performed, the backup function worked as intended,\u0027 former National Transportation Safety Board member Richard Healing told Bloomberg. \u0027My suspicion is it was the outside part but the frame held and kept it in place. It performed as intended.\u0027  Healing went on to say that passenger windows cracking is very rare and it\u0027s actually more common for cockpit windows to break.\u0027My sense is that its very rare for a cabin window to have that issue,\u0027 Healing, who now leads Air Safety Engineering, said. Patrick Smith, the pilot behind AskThePilot.com, told DailyMail.com that Wednesday\u0027s incident doesn\u0027t seem serious, and that it was probably only in the news because of the deadly accident two weeks ago.\u0027It appears that one layer of the inner window pane failed for some reason. It’s hard to say why at this point, but the result was nothing serious.\u0027If not for the fatality on board the Southwest flight a couple of weeks ago, it’s unlikely we’d be talking about this at all. The two incidents are completely unrelated, and this latest one is particularly minor,\u0027 Smith said. The plastic pane on the inside of the plane is to prevent passengers from getting access to the glass panes in the middle and on the outside.There is a middle pane of glass with a hole in it, then an air gap, followed by an outside pane of glass.This hole helps maintain the pressure differential and directs it onto the outer pane rather than the inner pane.          There are multiple layers of pane in each aircraft window in this case it was the outside pane which broke, a sign, says Richard Healing, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, that it was designed correctly          A patent (illustrated) filed by Daimlerchrysler Aerospace Airbus in 1997 explained this \u0027air conduit\u0027 helps maintain \u0027external atmospheric pressure inside\u0027 the panes. If all the panes were sealed, and didn\u0027t have holes, the pressure in the cabin would act on the inside pane of glass and there would be no failsafe if it cracked          The little hole at the bottom of the outside pane (stock image) regulates how much pressure from the cabin is exerted onto the window and makes sure that if the window is going to break - the outer pane goes first, which is what happened in this caseDespite the assurances from experts, passengers were nonetheless terrified.Linda Holley texted her son that the window broke and caused a \u0027loud noise\u0027.

This was not just because of the Scotsman\u0027s huge 6ft 2in frame or his dour, commanding demeanour — he was, after all, merely a group captain.The top brass gave this 43-year-old physicist their full attention because what he had to say on the morning of Monday, June 5, 1944, would affect the lives of millions across Europe.The military leaders assembled in the map room in Southwick House — a vast Georgian-style mansion near Portsmouth — really were the top brass. It was there the most senior Allied commanders, including General Dwight Eisenhower, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, Air Marshals Arthur Tedder and Trafford Leigh-Mallory, and Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, had gathered to launch D-Day.At their disposal was the mightiest invasion force the world has ever seen, including three million men, more than 1,200 warships, some 2,500 landing craft and 13,100 aircraft.Despite this immense power, these men were unable to control one vital element in their plans — the weather.The man most able to do so was Stagg, the chief meteorological adviser to Operation Overlord. It was his unenviable job to study the conflicting predictions given by three separate forecasting units, then to advise Eisenhower with one, unambiguous forecast.Outside the room, an unseasonable storm was battering the windows.It was because of that storm that D-Day was not launched on June 5 as planned. It was Stagg who had convinced the top brass to delay the invasion despite the misgivings of some, including Montgomery. But his successful forecast was to give him more authority.            The invasion force included three million men, more than 1,200 warships, some 2,500 landing craft and 13,100 aircraft          If he was wrong it would  mean the deaths of thousands of troops drowning in landing craft (pictured) unsuitable for stormy watersOnce dismissed by one admiral as \u0027six foot two inches of Stagg and six foot one inch of gloom\u0027 for his pessimistic forecasts, the top brass had to listen to him now.All they wanted to know was — could D-Day go ahead tomorrow, on June 6? General Eisenhower looked at Stagg. \u0027All right, Stagg,\u0027 said the American. \u0027What have you got for us this time?\u0027 Stagg cleared his throat and began.The story of how he and the teams under his command came to forecast the weather for one of the most pivotal events in history is the subject of a play by the award-winning actor David Haig.Opening at the Ambassadors Theatre in London\u0027s West End on — appropriately enough — June 6, Pressure tells how Stagg coped with the most extraordinary persuasion, coercion and intimidation to come up with the \u0027right\u0027 forecast, and how he had to battle the American forecasters, who were adamant that June 5 would have been fine to launch Overlord.The play is aptly named as Stagg not only, of course, had to study pressure charts, but he truly was under the most intolerable pressure.If his forecast for June 6 was wrong, and the invasion floundered in a storm, D-Day would fail.           Allied soldiers rush across the beach as the invasion begins on June 6 - on a clear day as Bragg predicted          British LCT\u0027s line the Normandy shore, each with a barrage balloon designed to discourage enemy air attackThat would not only mean the deaths of thousands of troops drowning in landing craft unsuitable for stormy waters, but also that the Nazis would continue to occupy Europe for years to come.The fate of the war — and indeed European civilisation — weighed heavily on Stagg\u0027s shoulders.For a man given so much influence, he came from a very modest background.Born in June 1900 and brought up in a small, stone terraced house in Dalkeith near Edinburgh, Stagg\u0027s father was a plumber and his mother a seamstress.Deadly Nazi Tiger Tank with armour so thick shells bounced...Remembering those who fought and died for our freedom: Tens...Share this articleA bright boy, he went to Edinburgh University after a brief spell as a mechanic in the nascent Royal Flying Corps, and gained a top degree in natural philosophy.He then won a scholarship to enable him to take an MA, which he gained in mathematics and natural philosophy.When one considers Stagg\u0027s role during the war, it comes as a surprise to learn that he was not a trained meteorologist, a gap in his CV which was often held against him by his detractors.Nevertheless, Stagg had plenty of experience in meteorology, not least because he joined the Met Office in October 1923, at first as an assistant resident observer in Kew, West London.          The Coast Guard LCI(L)-85, battered by enemy fire after approaching Omaha Beach, prepares to evacuate the troops to the U.S.S. Samuel Chase.  She sank shortly after this photograph was taken.          Coasters unloading onto DUKW\u0027s (amphibious vehicles) after D-Day at an unidentified location in Normandy, northern FranceHowever, his primary academic interest was in geophysics and the effects of the earth\u0027s magnetic field. Diligent and managerial, Stagg climbed the professional ladder very quickly and, in 1931, he was given the immense responsibility of leading a British expedition to the Arctic to study magnetism and meteorology.By 1939, and with a doctorate under his belt, Stagg was appointed superintendent of the Kew Gardens Observatory, a role which he soon left with the outbreak of war.Posted to the Met Office HQ in Kingsway, Central London, he oversaw weather services for the army and liaised with the RAF.As John Ross says in his definitive book, Forecast For D-Day: \u0027It is obvious that among the senior officers of the Met Office, he was clearly well suited to fill the role of chief meteorologist for the planning of D-Day.\u0027 It was a role Stagg took up in 1943, and almost from the start he came under enormous pressure. Rather than employ one team of forecasters, the top brass decided there should be three teams, with two men in each. The teams were called Widewing, Dunstable and Admiralty.Stagg\u0027s job was to oversee all three and find commonality in their predictions in order to present a single and definitive forecast to his superiors.          Landing craft and a fleet of protection vessels approach the beach code-named Omaha on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Omaha Beach saw the roughest fighting and the most Allied losses of the four beaches assaulted that dayUnfortunately for him, the teams had very different methods of forecasting and, as a result, came up with very different results. It is important to remember that forecasting in the 1940s — without satellite imagery — was an extremely hit-and-miss affair and it was widely regarded that anything longer than a two-day forecast was not worth the paper it was written on.However, the two forecasters in Widewing, the Americans Irving P. Krick and Ben Holzman, felt they could produce long-range forecasts by using their \u0027analogue\u0027 method. This essentially compared current weather patterns with historical patterns, then forecast that the weather would turn out as it had done in the past.          All the commanders wanted to know was — could D-Day go ahead tomorrow, on June 6? General Dwight D Eisenhower (pictured) looked at Stagg. \u0027All right, Stagg,\u0027 said the American. \u0027What have you got for us this time?\u0027Today, no forecaster would set much store with such a method, as huge changes in weather patterns can be brought about by tiny variables.Even at the time, analogue forecasting was not regarded as reliable, but the self-promoting Krick had successfully managed to convince his superiors that it was.As a result, the relationship between the three teams was fractious, and Stagg had his work cut out not only harmonising forecasts but also smoothing the ruffled feathers of those who had produced them. He doesn\u0027t appear to have been that successful.\u0027We six never agreed about anything except that Stagg was not a good meteorologist and that he was a bit of a glory hound,\u0027 recalled Dr Lawrence Hogben, who worked for the Admiralty team. Matters came to a head on June 3, just 48 hours before D-Day was supposed to have taken place.While the American team predicted that the weather would be fine on the 5th, the other two teams were forecasting a storm.Krick fought hard to get the Dunstable team to change their minds, but they stuck firm and Stagg was able to tell Eisenhower he would have to delay the invasion — but that, crucially, there might be a break in the weather on June 6. The supreme commander found that his generals, admirals and air marshals had different opinions. Montgomery was keen to ignore the forecast and stick with June 5, while Tedder wanted to postpone.It was up to Eisenhower to make the decision. \u0027Weighing all the factors, I decided that the attackwould have to be postponed,\u0027 he recalled.Despite the American forecasters and Montgomery, Stagg had got his way and the storm did indeed come on the 5th.          After landing at the shore, these British troops wait for the signal to move forward from the beaches of Normandy          Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beach on D-DayAnd it was at 04:15 that morning that Stagg once more found himself in front of Eisenhower, and being asked if the mighty offensive could be mounted the following morning.After clearing his throat, Stagg began. \u0027Well, I\u0027ll give you some good news,\u0027 he said. \u0027Gentlemen, no substantial change has taken place since last time, but as I see it, the little that has changed is in the direction of optimism.\u0027As predicted, Stagg reckoned that there would be a break in the weather — enough to mount the invasion.General Eisenhower then said quietly, \u0027OK. Let\u0027s go.\u0027 \u0027No one present disagreed,\u0027 he recalled, \u0027and there was a definite brightening of faces.\u0027Unsurprisingly Stagg, like so many others, did not sleep well the night before D-Day.If his teams were wrong, then his forecast would result in perhaps the greatest military catastrophe ever.Had D-Day not taken place on June 6, the ships that were already at sea would have had to return to port to refuel.          American troops of the 4th Infantry Division (Famous Fourth) land on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, while Allied forces storm the Normandy beaches on D-DayAnd because of the timings of the tides, that would have seen D-Day delayed to June 19 — when there was a most extraordinary storm, which many meteorologists maintain would have been almost impossible to have forecast with the technology of the time. D-Day would have been a literal wash-out.But as dawn broke, Stagg was to be proved right. There was a break in the weather — and the rest is history.After the war, Stagg remained in meteorology and became director of services at the Meteorological Office until 1960.He was also president of the Royal Meteorological Society, although contrary to some reports, he was never knighted, but instead made a CB — a Companion of the Order of the Bath.He also received the U.S. Legion of Merit. He died in 1975, not long after publishing an account of his wartime experiences in 1971.Even today, meteorologists are ided over who really should take credit for the D-Day forecasts.Whatever the truth — and it is a tangled web to unweave — there can be no doubt that thanks to Stagg\u0027s leadership of a quarrelsome bunch of scientists, he presented his boss with the right answer. "},{"url":null,"title":"MAC end sickie","story":"    Mac on... the end of the sickie: \u0027Enough!\u0027 I said to the contagious disease nurse. \u0027I\u0027m going back to be with my colleagues.\u0027 Mac\u0027s 2017 Seen and Unseen book is available for £11.99 plus £1.99 p\u0026ampp. Order at mailshop.co.uk using code MP1861846 or phone 0844 571 0640.

The Government claims it is safe for him to return to the Afghan capital Kabul.More than 178,000 people, including war heroes and politicians, have signed a petition to allow loyal interpreters into the UK.A Government spokesman said it did not expect the interpreters to return to Afghanistan and had \u0027always been clear\u0027 they could apply to settle permanently."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/00/4BC3B26300000578-5684863-image-a-24_1525303320592.jpg","title":"An female Subbuteo team Classic table football game hauls 21st century","story":"    The FA and the game\u0027s maker, Hasbro, revealed the limited edition version of the table football game ahead of the SSE Women\u0027s FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on May 5          English footballer Sue Smith (left) and  FA head of marketing for women’s football Marzena Bogdanowicz at Wembley Stadium playing with the first all-female Subbuteo setAnd even though it has fallen behind the times, Subbuteo retained a place in hearts and minds, as well as in popular culture, where it has featured in pop songs, plays and films.Now the game has hauled itself into the 21st century in at least one respect – by launching its first female teams.Bosses say the move reflects the rapid growth of women’s football.That\u0027s a lot of swap, swap, need! \u0027World\u0027s most expensive\u0027...\u0027He\u0027s all class\u0027: Footy star is applauded after calling for...Share this articleThe FA and makers Hasbro revealed the limited edition version of the game ahead of the Women’s FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium this Saturday, with the Subbuteo figures wearing the colours of finalists Arsenal and Chelsea. The FA said the new version supported its objective to tackle barriers within the women’s game.The set includes 22 outfield players and six substitutes, each hand-moulded and painted with their own characteristics – and detailing that is clearly female.The classic Subbuteo box has also been given a new design.           Each of the figures of the Subbuteo set are wearing the colours of finalists Arsenal and Chelsea          Figures from the first all-female Subbuteo set, which has been launched to reflect the rapid growth of women\u0027s football in the UKAlthough the set is not available to buy, fans will have the opportunity to win one via FA social media channels.Marzena Bogdanowicz, FA head of marketing for women’s football, said: ‘This new, all-female Subbuteo set is a reflection of the rapid growth that women’s football is seeing in the UK right now.‘We aspire to greater equality all the way from board games to boardrooms, and every day we are striving to transform the future of the women’s game on and off the pitch.’Interest in women’s football in the UK has grown rapidly since the England team, known as the Lionesses, finished third at the 2015 Women’s World Cup.

The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that. For decades, Noonan was suspected of being a predatory sex offender by the police, the public, fellow villains and even members of his own family.But he did not have any criminal convictions for a sex offence to confirm the rumours - until now.The defendant, from Moston, Manchester, was described as a \u0027persistent sexual offender\u0027 on the first day of his trial, as he pleaded not guilty to all charges including eight counts of indecent assault and attempted rape.  Extraordinary moment British man \u0027walked into a Colorado art...Estate agent, 27, caught doing 72mph in 40mph zone in her...Share this articleThe court heard he groomed and molested boys after plying them with drink.In his opening statement, prosecutor Darren Preston told Manchester Crown Court: \u0027It is the prosecution case that over many years, the defendant engaged and was acting as a persistent sexual predator.  He is already serving an 11-year sentence for arson, blackmail and perverting the course of justice, passed in 2015. The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that\u0027He surrounded himself with young teenage boys, usually vulnerable boys, has groomed them by plying them with alcohol, favours and sometimes threats, and has routinely sexually abused them.\u0027He also traded on what he perceived was his notoriety and reputation in the local area.\u0027 His first victim was aged just 10 when Noonan, who was six years older, took him from a care home and indecently assaulted him twice, ordering the boy not to tell anyone.The second victim said he was 16 or 17 when he first met Noonan outside a pizzeria. He told how Noonan threatened him, accusing him of having called him \u0027gay\u0027, before he was beaten by a gang of teens with hockey sticks. He then indecently assaulted the boy on a few occasions, once in a disused shop.A third victim said he was in his early teens in the 2000s when he met Noonan, who molested him on 20 or more occasions. He described how he would spend time driving around with Noonan and other young lads. He would be taken to parties where there was drink and drugs. Noonan would ply them with drink, but not get drunk himself. His victim described being \u0027brainwashed\u0027 into thinking the abuse was normal.The fourth victim was aged in his mid-teens when he met Noonan in the 2000s, agreeing to renovate a pub for him. This victim was said to be completely under Noonan\u0027s spell.At the conclusion of his trial at Manchester Crown Court, Noonan was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault, one of attempted rape, two of inciting a child into sexual activity, one of sexual assault and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.  One of 14 siblings, Noonan became the spokesman for the family following death of his brother Damian, aged 37, in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2004, followed by the murder of his brother Dessie in 2005.Dessie and Damian had worked on the door of the Hacienda in the 1980s and were then said to control the supply of drugs at the nightclub.When they died, Dominic Noonan became the boss, or at least he gave the appearance of being the head of the family.A cunning, intelligent inidual, he admitted to being \u0027thoroughly dishonest\u0027 during his trial. He has trumpeted that he is anti-racist and has made much of being able to speak Urdu although, actually, he only knows a few phrases. Over the years, Greater Manchester Police have found little difficulty in obtaining evidence to lock him up for everything from possessing a gun to arson and blackmail.He has spent most of his adult life behind bars. But proving he was a predatory sex offender was another matter. In 2010, a rape charge was dropped. Shortly after he was released from a long prison sentence on licence, he was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room after celebrating his birthday but prosecutors dropped the case.  In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prisonIn 2013, he was cleared of child rape charges after the court heard his accuser had a history of making false complaints. He had been accused of molesting the boy of 15 in a flat in Bloom Street in Manchester city centre.In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Officers said his \u0027outrageous\u0027 actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started when he yelled: \u0027I am going to jump.\u0027 in 2016, he was found not guilty of engaging in a sex act in front of a minor, although he was convicted of perverting the course of justice by offering £5,000 to the boy\u0027s family to get the charge dropped. The prosecution alleged that the boy covered his face with a poster as a \u0027vulnerable\u0027 adult man was intimidated into performing a sex act on Noonan in a bedroom, he was also convicted of arson and blackmail connected to a row over an ice cream van, and jailed for eleven years.So, while police have tried many times, it is only now that Noonan has been brought to justice for sex offences."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/08/4BCBB2FC00000578-0-image-m-10_1525334205054.jpg","title":"Estate agent caught doing 72mph 40mph zone late work avoids speeding ban","story":"    Nicola Robinson, 27, was clocked doing 72mph in a 40mph zoneAn estate agent caught doing 72mph in a 40mph zone has escaped a road ban after she blamed her driving on being late for work.Nicola Robinson, 27, was clocked at nearly twice the legal limit as she sped through Manchester city centre in her red BMW 116i Sport.The senior sales negotiator for estate agents Jordan Fishwick was travelling from her parents\u0027 luxury barn conversion in Bolton.She had faced a possible disqualification of up to 56 days under rules targeting drivers who travel at 45 per cent above the limit.But at Manchester magistrates court Miss Robinson, who has a clean driving record in ten years of motoring, escaped with six penalty points after telling JPs a ban could mean her losing her job and not being able to pay rent to her parents.She admitted speeding but urged the court not to ban her adding: \u0027I will never do it again - all of my life I have been an estate agent and I don\u0027t know what else I would do.\u0027She also said she had installed a \u0027speed limiter\u0027 in her BMW allowing her to set a maximum speed she can travel at.The incident occurred on July 13 last year when Miss Robinson was flashed by a camera on the A6 Broad Street in Salford as she was driving into work for an afternoon shift. The court heard she was brought before JPs due to the speed she was travelling at.

Kim\u0027s meeting with Xi was his first foreign visit since he took power in 2011.  Today\u0027s meeting between Kim and Wang was held at the headquarters of Workers\u0027 Party of Korea, according to China\u0027s state newspaper People\u0027s Daily.China\u0027s president Xi extended greetings to Kim through Wang, said People\u0027s Daily.     China\u0027s president Xi (right) met Kim (left) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in March          ​​​​China\u0027s foreign minister, Wang Yi (left), arrived in North Korea\u0027s capital on Wednesday.

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/01/1AC9DEEE00000514-0-image-m-51_1525220799382.jpg","title":"Hamleys owner control House Fraser shut stores","story":"      Closures: House of Fraser plans to shut a number of its department stores across the UKC.banner has purchased a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser, which was previously controlled by Chinese group Nanjing Cenbest, which is part of the Sanpower conglomerate. Cenbest, which is part of the Sanpower Group, will remain a significant minority shareholder.

In this picture, Mr Carnicelli captured a young boy in Chicago leaning against a signpost at the moment a green bus marked \u0027INDIANA\u0027 passes by in 1966          When Mr Carnicelli (pictured in New York in 1966) returned to Italy after his first trip to the US, he showcased his photographs in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027          His new book says he named that exhibition  because he \u0027felt almost like an intruder in a society completely new to him\u0027. A group of construction workers are pictured giving directions in New York in 1966          He went on to become a freelance photojournalist who worked with several Italian newspapers and magazines and traveled around the world until he retired from photography in the early 1970s.

Telling it is easy and difficult at the same time. Behind that opulent face, it has many others all of them true, all of them deeply meaningful.\u0027 The images also showed the sadness and loneliness juxtaposed with the American Dream from his European perspective.

A black \u002767 Plymouth Belvedere is pictured in Brooklyn in 1967Mr Carnicelli\u0027s family ran a photography equipment business when he was growing up, so it wasn\u0027t a surprise that he started taking photographs himself.

However, by the early 1970s, he decided to retire from photography and open a photo development and printing business in Florence, following in his family\u0027s footsteps.Thousands of his photographs, including those he took on his visits to the US, were stored away in his cellar and forgotten for 50 years until they were rediscovered by curator Bärbel Reinhard last year.

The incident that happened two weeks ago was caused by an exploding engine           The Chicago flight was on its way to Newark when it erted to Cleveland on WednesdaySince only the outer pane broke, the cabin didn\u0027t lose pressurization and the flight landed without issue or any injuries. Windows on commercial planes typically have three panes - outer, middle and inner - made of acrylic and glass.The fact that just the outer pane broke is evidence that the window was acting as designed. In fact, it\u0027s that little hole at the bottom of the outside pane that regulates how much pressure from the cabin is exerted onto the window and makes sure that if the window is going to break - the outer pane goes first.\u0027The way they are designed, the window performed, the backup function worked as intended,\u0027 former National Transportation Safety Board member Richard Healing told Bloomberg. \u0027My suspicion is it was the outside part but the frame held and kept it in place. It performed as intended.\u0027  Healing went on to say that passenger windows cracking is very rare and it\u0027s actually more common for cockpit windows to break.\u0027My sense is that its very rare for a cabin window to have that issue,\u0027 Healing, who now leads Air Safety Engineering, said. Patrick Smith, the pilot behind AskThePilot.com, told DailyMail.com that Wednesday\u0027s incident doesn\u0027t seem serious, and that it was probably only in the news because of the deadly accident two weeks ago.\u0027It appears that one layer of the inner window pane failed for some reason. It’s hard to say why at this point, but the result was nothing serious.\u0027If not for the fatality on board the Southwest flight a couple of weeks ago, it’s unlikely we’d be talking about this at all. The two incidents are completely unrelated, and this latest one is particularly minor,\u0027 Smith said. The plastic pane on the inside of the plane is to prevent passengers from getting access to the glass panes in the middle and on the outside.There is a middle pane of glass with a hole in it, then an air gap, followed by an outside pane of glass.This hole helps maintain the pressure differential and directs it onto the outer pane rather than the inner pane.          There are multiple layers of pane in each aircraft window in this case it was the outside pane which broke, a sign, says Richard Healing, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, that it was designed correctly          A patent (illustrated) filed by Daimlerchrysler Aerospace Airbus in 1997 explained this \u0027air conduit\u0027 helps maintain \u0027external atmospheric pressure inside\u0027 the panes. If all the panes were sealed, and didn\u0027t have holes, the pressure in the cabin would act on the inside pane of glass and there would be no failsafe if it cracked          The little hole at the bottom of the outside pane (stock image) regulates how much pressure from the cabin is exerted onto the window and makes sure that if the window is going to break - the outer pane goes first, which is what happened in this caseDespite the assurances from experts, passengers were nonetheless terrified.Linda Holley texted her son that the window broke and caused a \u0027loud noise\u0027.

The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that. For decades, Noonan was suspected of being a predatory sex offender by the police, the public, fellow villains and even members of his own family.But he did not have any criminal convictions for a sex offence to confirm the rumours - until now.The defendant, from Moston, Manchester, was described as a \u0027persistent sexual offender\u0027 on the first day of his trial, as he pleaded not guilty to all charges including eight counts of indecent assault and attempted rape.  Extraordinary moment British man \u0027walked into a Colorado art...Estate agent, 27, caught doing 72mph in 40mph zone in her...Share this articleThe court heard he groomed and molested boys after plying them with drink.In his opening statement, prosecutor Darren Preston told Manchester Crown Court: \u0027It is the prosecution case that over many years, the defendant engaged and was acting as a persistent sexual predator.  He is already serving an 11-year sentence for arson, blackmail and perverting the course of justice, passed in 2015. The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that\u0027He surrounded himself with young teenage boys, usually vulnerable boys, has groomed them by plying them with alcohol, favours and sometimes threats, and has routinely sexually abused them.\u0027He also traded on what he perceived was his notoriety and reputation in the local area.\u0027 His first victim was aged just 10 when Noonan, who was six years older, took him from a care home and indecently assaulted him twice, ordering the boy not to tell anyone.The second victim said he was 16 or 17 when he first met Noonan outside a pizzeria. He told how Noonan threatened him, accusing him of having called him \u0027gay\u0027, before he was beaten by a gang of teens with hockey sticks. He then indecently assaulted the boy on a few occasions, once in a disused shop.A third victim said he was in his early teens in the 2000s when he met Noonan, who molested him on 20 or more occasions. He described how he would spend time driving around with Noonan and other young lads. He would be taken to parties where there was drink and drugs. Noonan would ply them with drink, but not get drunk himself. His victim described being \u0027brainwashed\u0027 into thinking the abuse was normal.The fourth victim was aged in his mid-teens when he met Noonan in the 2000s, agreeing to renovate a pub for him. This victim was said to be completely under Noonan\u0027s spell.At the conclusion of his trial at Manchester Crown Court, Noonan was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault, one of attempted rape, two of inciting a child into sexual activity, one of sexual assault and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.  One of 14 siblings, Noonan became the spokesman for the family following death of his brother Damian, aged 37, in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2004, followed by the murder of his brother Dessie in 2005.Dessie and Damian had worked on the door of the Hacienda in the 1980s and were then said to control the supply of drugs at the nightclub.When they died, Dominic Noonan became the boss, or at least he gave the appearance of being the head of the family.A cunning, intelligent inidual, he admitted to being \u0027thoroughly dishonest\u0027 during his trial. He has trumpeted that he is anti-racist and has made much of being able to speak Urdu although, actually, he only knows a few phrases. Over the years, Greater Manchester Police have found little difficulty in obtaining evidence to lock him up for everything from possessing a gun to arson and blackmail.He has spent most of his adult life behind bars. But proving he was a predatory sex offender was another matter. In 2010, a rape charge was dropped. Shortly after he was released from a long prison sentence on licence, he was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room after celebrating his birthday but prosecutors dropped the case.  In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prisonIn 2013, he was cleared of child rape charges after the court heard his accuser had a history of making false complaints. He had been accused of molesting the boy of 15 in a flat in Bloom Street in Manchester city centre.In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Officers said his \u0027outrageous\u0027 actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started when he yelled: \u0027I am going to jump.\u0027 in 2016, he was found not guilty of engaging in a sex act in front of a minor, although he was convicted of perverting the course of justice by offering £5,000 to the boy\u0027s family to get the charge dropped. The prosecution alleged that the boy covered his face with a poster as a \u0027vulnerable\u0027 adult man was intimidated into performing a sex act on Noonan in a bedroom, he was also convicted of arson and blackmail connected to a row over an ice cream van, and jailed for eleven years.So, while police have tried many times, it is only now that Noonan has been brought to justice for sex offences."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/13/4BC3C78D00000578-0-image-m-12_1525264756142.jpg","title":"Entire 10 000 population volcanic Ambae Island Vanuatu permanently evacuated","story":"    The island was temporarily evacuated last September when the eruption cycle began.

He said there is lots of fine-grained ash, which can affect people\u0027s breathing and respiratory functioning.Other countries including France, New Zealand and Australia provided aid and financial help for the earlier evacuation. Australia on Thursday announced it was providing 300,000 dollars to help with the island\u0027s permanent evacuation, with a focus on the needs of women, children and people with disabilities.

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e14d68e27af6246ab815b44edea7bcbf76db0757/46_59_5137_3083/master/5137.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c3097021de5608b74c6bfde6b3a9f2","title":"talktalk and vodafone dishing up worst uk customer service","story":"Ofcom finds broadband users with TalkTalk and Vodafone mobile customers got worst treatment among providersTalkTalk and Vodafone have been named as the UK’s worst broadband and mobile providers respectively for customer service.Ofcom, the media and broadcasting regulator, has listed the broadband, landline and mobile phone providers as having the worst customer service records, based on a comprehensive survey.The study, which looked at customer satisfaction, complaints and call-waiting times, found that TalkTalk’s broadband customers received the worst treatment of any provider.TalkTalk may have had the second quickest call-waiting time – at an average of 52 seconds compared to EE, which topped out at 48 seconds – but only four in 10 of those surveyed said they were satisfied with how their complaint had been handled. A breakdown of the nine metrics Ofcom looked at to determine how well a broadband provider performed showed that TalkTalk to be the worst performing in all of the factors, from willingness to help resolve a problem to courtesy and politeness of advisers.In the broadband customer service list, (ascending in quality), TalkTalk was followed by BT and its subsidiary EE in joint second Sky and Virgin Media were joint third, and the BT-owned Plusnet ranked best. TalkTalk also rated worst for customer service relating to issues from home owners who had their landline with the company.“In the case of TalkTalk, which scores poorly in terms of a range of customer service measures, there’s a feeling that the provider has struggled to redress its public image since the high-profile data breach of 2015,” said Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at the price comparison site uSwitch.The survey found that Ofcom received more complaints per 100,000 mobile users (48) against Vodafone than any about other provider.Overall, Virgin Mobile customers were least happy with the service they received, with less than half saying they were satisfied with the way their complaints were handled.“Broadband and mobile are now essential services for many of us,” Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said. “Consumers deserve services that meet the demands of modern life, yet these new figures show that not all providers are delivering. Citizens Advice research also reveals that loyal customers face higher prices in the telecoms market.” Among mobile companies, Tesco Mobile and Giffgaff, which is owned by O2’s parent company Telefónica, topped the table with customers most likely to recommend the providers to a friend.“People often focus on price when they’re choosing a phone or broadband provider,” said Lindsey Fussell, consumer group director at Ofcom. “But there are big differences in the customer service offered by providers. We are encouraging people to look beyond the price and consider customer service, too. In such a competitive market companies simply can’t afford to let their service standards slip. If they don’t up their game, customers can vote with their feet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa74d0828da201ada3d4d59191b91967e34151b/0_105_4342_2605/master/4342.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b96f2b34419cc0c69e88b88c081366","title":"an open book a photographers love letter to city libraries in pictures","story":"Swiss librarian and photographer Thomas Guignard captures the beauty, symmetry and intricate designs of libraries across the worldTo some they are a sanctuary, to others a place of silent boredom, but to Swiss photographer Thomas Guignard libraries are a thing of beauty. Working as a librarian and photographer for the last 12 years, Canada-based Guignard combines his great loves in the Instagram account @concretelibraries. “Libraries are the tangible, physical and often monumental representation of human knowledge,” he says. “They are built to share and make that knowledge accessible, to foster community, to encourage the sharing of ideas and invite everyone to contribute to that trove of knowledge.”Guignard has photographed library buildings across the world, from his current hometown of Toronto to Oxford, UK via Detroit in the US. So far he’s visited 35 libraries and has a bucket list of about 310 that he hopes to visit and photograph in the future. Guignard’s interest in library architecture grew in parallel with his photography practice. Whilst working for the library at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, he was involved in the development of a new learning centre, which opened in 2010. As part of his research, Guignard visited other, photographing unique details of their design, and gradually became fascinated by them.“As I visited those libraries, I took more and more pictures, and became more interested in those spaces for their unique aesthetics,” he says.“I try to use symmetry and pay particular attention to how I align my shots to highlight the sacredness of these spaces.”Guignard sees libraries as symbols of “gathering places for communities”. “They are participatory they can’t exist without users, a community – and, of course, librarians and library workers, who do so much more than just stamp out books.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @cities.

The city I worked in briefly in my youth still had mills towering over its hillsides and tycoon mansions lining Manningham Lane. The centre was a tight group of Victorian palaces and wool warehouses. It could just echo TS Eliot’s assurance, sitting “like a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire”. There were fashionable shops in Darley Street, once the Bond Street of the north, which was jammed with Rolls-Royces.Bradford council’s chief executive, Kersten England, is a woman on a mission. She burns with a determination to pull the city around, and aims “to make Bradford the Shoreditch of Yorkshire”. She declines to join the northern chorus for more grants, subsidies and attention from London. She has given up on competing with her neighbouring rival, booming Leeds. She wants “not to do things, but to help others to do them” – to facilitate the revival of an “alternative Bradford”.Undaunted, England led me through a maze of deserted alleys to her micro-Shoreditch, a subterranean warren of old storage tunnels and caves. Here a local developer, Graham Hall, has bravely invested £2m in craft beer pubs, gin bars, artisanal food outlets and music venues, cluttered with railway junk and industrial antiques. Sunbridgewells is a hipster cliche, but England sees it as ground zero of Bradford’s “creative hub”. She was so proud of it that last year she persuaded Princess Anne – hardly a hipster – to declare it open. The Shoreditch model requires others to flock to Sunbridgewells, but this has yet to happen. Waterstones has converted the old Wool Exchange into what must be its most exotic shop. A few pubs, such as the famous Sparrow, cling to life nearby. The Little Shop of Soaps briefly showed its artisanal face next to Sunbridgewells but is closing “for lack of footfall”, says its owner Tracey Lavelle. Up the road from Rawson Square is David Craig’s Assembly warehouse, host to a group of freelance designers and publishers. Craig reckons the space costs roughly half what it would in suburban Saltaire, and a fifth what it would in Leeds. But he is a pioneer. He admits he was drawn to Bradford by its underdog status and “gritty, do-it-yourself nature”. He and his colleagues “have a passion for the city”, even though only a few live there. As yet they are less a hub than an oasis.  Another champion of the new Bradford, Amir Hussain, is an architect with an expanding practice in the city’s Goitside district. He wants to persuade second- and third-generation Asians to come out of their suburban enclaves into the “centre of the donut”, bringing with them some of the ethnic vitality of the high streets and bazaars visible in the city’s encircling “villages”.  Bradford has long been victim of half a century of crisis in British town planning. Already in the 1970s the local council was committing suicide. As if to eradicate its past as capital of the wool trade, it began the demolition of its Victorian core and drove a road through the wreckage. Sites were cleared for blocks of what the Pevsner guide calls “mind-numbing banality”.  In the 1980s the city toyed with Thatcherism under the leadership of Eric Pickles. A third of people on the council payroll were sacked, some 9,000 jobs, with no compensating upturn in private employment. Tory Whitehall gave the city a meagre reward in the form of a photography museum and a tax office. One failed – its photographs were carted off to London’s V\u0026ampA – and the other is closing. Dispersal was the last thing central Bradford wanted. The council answered with a killer punch of its own. It cleared a 12-acre swathe of land behind the city hall for a giant, introverted shopping mall, Broadway. When it opened a few years ago, it killed all other retail activity in the city centre like a plague. I have never seen such commercial devastation caused by a single planning decision. It is hard not to warm to the determination of England and her team. Yorkshire cities are notoriously bad neighbours, and Bradford’s rivalry with Leeds, 10 miles away, is the stuff of history. But the city planner, Bhupinder Dev, knows his future lies in finding a relationship with Leeds. The contrast is almost obscene. Leeds seems rich. It has drawn big government investments in universities and hospitals. Towers of luxury flats line the old canal. Smart shops define the Headrow. Council leader Judith Blake told me her chief challenge was “an acute shortage of skilled labour”. To her, Bradford’s value to Leeds was almost humiliating – its unemployment rate and its output of school leavers.  Dev and England want Bradford to be “alternative” and creative. “We simply must make central Bradford a place in which people want to live, not from which they are desperate to move,” says Dev. Successful Asians, he says, are drifting away to Pudsey on the Leeds road to avoid a Bradford postcode.  Bradford has tried this before. Across the centre of town is Little Germany, a neighbourhood of handsome sandstone warehouses next to the cathedral. It was given a conservation makeover 10 years ago, and is home to the Bradford Playhouse and a scatter of studios and galleries. A large portrait of the city’s favourite son David Hockney adorns a building exterior. But Little Germany lacks critical mass and residents are wary of the place.  While music venues and arts festivals draw audiences, they do not draw residents. Somehow life must be breathed into dead Victorian streets and old mills. The spirit that once revived San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and the ever-cited Shoreditch must be found somewhere. These places recovered by sucking activity and enterprise from adjacent areas of wealth. Bradford must do that from Leeds.  The ShoreditchDetroit model requires extreme measures. It requires unused buildings to be released by their owners into a “down and out” economy. They must gradually attract artists, designers and writers, people who appear to find inspiration in dereliction. They in turn hand over to digital entrepreneurs and other “creatives”. Bradford may not be as desperate as Detroit, but the longer it sits and hopes, the more its centre will depopulate and deteriorate.  The Yorkshire economy has been tortoise to the hare of Manchester’s northern powerhouse. It has depended on the employment hotspots of Leeds and Sheffield, on prosperous farming and on tourism to York, Harrogate and the Dales. This has left “cold spots” in the old mining and mill towns, Barnsley, Rotherham, Wakefield and Huddersfield. The pits and the looms have disappeared and nothing has taken their place.  Bradford is the most challenging by far. It is lucky to have in England, her council leader, Susan Hinchliffe, and Leeds’s Judith Blake, leaders of stature and intelligence, who seem to get the point of Yorkshire’s future. They are well-placed to capitalise on a promised new dawn in Yorkshire politics, with Labour MP Dan Jarvis who will run for mayor of South Yorkshire. He is rumoured to have his eye on becoming mayor of all Yorkshire, of “God’s own county”. He might start by declaring Bradford “God’s own Shoreditch”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cacf94f206569df3e5b8ca506800806fb573ecd7/0_101_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a624dbc031573f0ae5b565dc3e2d8c","title":"home office new generation windrushers","story":"Young people born or raised in the UK are being ensnared by Kafkaesque bureaucracy – and paying an extortionate price for itThe new home secretary, Sajid Javid, has\u0026nbspwasted no time in disowning the\u0026nbspphrase “hostile environment”. But the real test he faces isn’t one of superficial terminology. First, there is the question of whether he will do anything to dismantle the day-to-day reality of prejudice that ensnared the Windrush generation with such appalling consequences whether he will concede that obliging landlords to check people’s papers under the threat of fines or imprisonment drags us backwards to a world where people with dark skin routinely face discrimination or that cutting off access to housing and work risks forcing people into exploitation on the black market.But there’s another dirty secret buried in the Home\u0026nbspOffice. The government’s futile, arbitrary target to\u0026nbspreduce net immigration to the tens of thousands means it is not just imposing further restrictions on who\u0026nbspcan come to the UK from abroad (no matter that the\u0026nbspNHS is desperate for doctors). It is making it harder for people here legally, including those who’ve grown up\u0026nbsphere, to become permanently settled.First, the eye-watering fees mean it costs more than £1,000 just to claim a child’s legal entitlement to citizenship if they were born in Britain to parents not settled here (they get this entitlement either when a parent becomes permanently settled or after they’ve lived here for 10 years). The Home Office makes a profit of £640 on each case. Some parents just don’t have the money, which means their British-born children may later be unable to work, go to university or use the NHS. Astonishingly, local authorities are obliged to fork out this fee for affected children in their care: a big financial disincentive to sorting this out before they turn 18. And if they don’t make citizenship applications for children – not born here, but who’ve spent most of their lives in care – they lose the right to apply altogether when they turn 18.For a young adult not born here but who has mostly grown up in Britain, the costs are even higher. They can apply for limited leave to remain for two and a half years after they turn 18, but it will cost more than £2,000 in fees and surcharges each time. They can only apply for indefinite leave to remain after 10 years, by which point they will have already paid at least £8,000. If they forget to renew their limited leave to remain (there are no TV licence-style reminders) or they can’t afford to do so, they have to start back from square one. If they want to go to university, they are treated as international students – charged thousands of pounds more in fees and blocked from student loans – until they’ve had three years of limited leave to remain, despite the fact their parents may have long been British taxpayers.The system is so fiendishly complex it takes a lawyer to navigate it. But there’s no longer any legal aid available, so these young people have to fund their own legal advice. There are plenty of sharks out there the charity Just for Kids Law has seen many cases in which shoddy advice means applications are rejected.In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to provide evidence that meets Home Office tests. There has been a dramatic shift in culture such that just a few years ago, if you could recall childhood memories of national events in an interview, that would have been accepted as proof that you had grown up in Britain. Today the bar is so high that people have to provide four pieces of documentary evidence for each year they have lived here. The sworn written statements from a doctor or a neighbour that would be accepted as evidence in a criminal court won’t do. The Home Office refuses to grant children in care citizenship unless they can produce documents such as their parents’ birth certificates – even when they are estranged from their birth parents.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Even if you can get all these documents together, there are two reasons why there’s no guarantee your application will be processed. First, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) tells me the Home Office is apt to lose people’s files, or claim it has never received documents. Second, every person over the age of nine applying for citizenship or leave to remain is subject to a “good character” test. JCWI has seen people fall foul of this test simply because they have had a previous immigration application rejected for minor errors.Worse, according to Solange Valdez-Symonds of the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens, there are cases where children in care have had their applications for citizenship rejected because they have been cautioned by the police – all too common for children who have had troubled childhoods.If you make even a small error in a complex form that s tens of pages, your application risks being rejected: JCWI cites rejections as a result of someone getting one figure wrong in one instance of a date filled in multiple times across the same form. While mistakes are rife in Home Office decision-making (half of all immigration appeals are now successful) the right to appeal has been scrapped in most cases. If you’re rejected, your only recourse is to apply – and pay up – again.Imagine trying to negotiate your way through all this as a young adult with limited financial resources, who grew up in Britain, who identifies as British – who to all intents and purposes is British. Everything about this system is designed to catch you out, to end in rejection. If you run out of cash or steam, you’ll end up as one of the “illegals” denied access to healthcare, education, housing and a job by Theresa May’s “hostile environment”. Just for Kids Law estimates that tens of thousands of young people could be affected.This is the sick reality that should be as big a scandal as the treatment of the Windrush generation. Even as it promises to right those terrible wrongs, the government is knowingly, consciously creating the next generation of Windrushers. And it doesn’t care.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5d6ce10641d6f223580c23c9c4588cb486fdd6/0_147_5183_3110/master/5183.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2473bfb527ba8b72a7e1e452697dbfaa","title":"choice inequality education system social segregation","story":"In Britain, social segregation starts early, with a few given the tools to succeed while the rest are abandonedWhat price can you put on a child’s education? It depends on who that child is. New figures show the average fee for attending a top private school has now risen above £17,000 a year for the first time. In contrast, a child attending a state school in England can expect to have £4,000 to £6,000 spent on them, depending on location and additional allowances. This would be worrying in any circumstances but when we have crumbling and cramped state schools, it feels almost grotesque. While some children enjoy drama halls and swimming pools, others are trying to learn surrounded by leaks, mould and vermin.Inequality in education is not a new phenomenon. Even before vast underfunding set in, we had one of the most unequal school systems in the developed world. Private schools, remarkably, still retain charitable status, a gift from the taxpayer for retaining privilege. (The chair of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents most of Britain’s leading public schools, once compared making greater links between private and state schools as a condition of their tax break to the ordeal of forced marriage.) There is also rampant inequality even within the state sector, with middle-class offspring more likely to get a better deal from a comprehensive.With aching predictability, austerity measures have made this situation worse. Last year, an analysis of Department for Education data revealed that schools with the highest numbers of pupils on free school meals are facing the deepest funding cuts. Ministers have chosen to make “savings” predominantly off the back of low-income pupils in an education system that was already stacked against them.Instead of investing in existing state schools, the government has wasted money on vanity projects. Since the Conservatives’ free schools policy was introduced in 2010, it’s pushed funding from other pupils, often paying way over the odds for the land and even erting £96m to academy budgets originally intended for improving in-need comprehensives.How has this plan worked out? This month, Plymouth studio school announced it would be the latest free school to close, only a couple of days after the Isle of Wight studio school said it would do the same due to lack of demand. The National Education Union (NEU) calculates that the latest closures bring the total to 66 new schools launched under the government’s flagship policy that have closed, partially closed or failed to open at all. “Free school” is a misnomer: while teachers are running out of paper for their classrooms, this ideological failure has cost the education budget almost £150m.In a 2016 league table of all measures of poverty, the UK did rather better compared with other nations. The study, also by Unicef, ranked the UK joint-14th out of 35 rich nations. This was just above the US, but well below many European countries, notably Denmark, Finland and Norway. On some specific measures the UK did less well, notably education, where it\u0026nbspranked 25th\u0026nbspout of 39 countries, and health, where it was 19th out of 35.In the\u0026nbsplatest official comparison\u0026nbspof poverty across the 28 countries in the European Union, the UK ranked 15th. This was some way behind the Czech Republic, Sweden and the Netherlands but ahead of Ireland, Spain and Italy. The European figures confirmed the JRF’s observation that the number of people at risk of poverty in the UK has risen since 2008.Bear in mind also that free schools predominantly serve wealthier communities. Free schools and academies, just like grammar schools, educate significantly fewer children in receipt of free school meals (in fact, half of all free school meal children are educated in just a fifth of all schools). The ideology of “choice”, be it private or free school, has always been code for “inequality”.It’s an inequality that feels particularly desperate right now. Britain as a whole is becoming more and more ided, as the wealthiest iniduals see their fortunes surge by hundreds of billions, while food banks are handing out a record number of parcels. Soaring child poverty is the unforgiving result of this: schoolchildren left to sleep on cardboard boxes before going to class the next morning malnourished, tiny bodies, stuffing their pockets with food at school, or taking scraps from the school bins, because their parents can’t afford a hot meal at home. Education this week reported that deprivation has reached such a level that teachers are helping parents pay for underwear, a mattress, and even non-uniform clothes for weekends “so they can feel normal”.It is well-established that unequal societies create damage not only for the poorest but also for the whole population. The Harvard professor Ichiro Kawachi describes inequality as a “social pollutant” – a rot that breeds anything from mental health problems and loss of community to reduced wellbeing.Education – that supposed leveller and bastion of opportunity – far from providing a route to a better life in this country, is only replicating this inequality. Whether it’s tax breaks for private schools, futile free schools, or underfunded comprehensives, we are sleepwalking into an ever deepening class system – one in which a select few are given the tools to excel, and the rest are abandoned to the scraps. A time in which school inequality is deepening against a backdrop of rocketing child poverty may feel a hopeless point for progress but really, it should be a call to arms. It is not radical to say children from low-income families matter just as much as those born, on the roll of the dice, to advantage. Well-funded schools are the bedrock for a decent future – not just for some kids but for all of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53fb64621bf2fe69a32be2b6f9ce7620999323c2/0_265_5517_3310/master/5517.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62dcef7f5fa8c8351c64d7adfcae0dfc","title":"recovering alcoholic minimum booze pricing scotland poverty drink","story":"Poverty is at the root of my country’s problem with drink. But this policy is still a step in the right directionNothing fires up we Scots quite like someone threatening to lengthen our life expectancy. And now, thanks to legislation that puts a floor on the price of alcohol, many of us have a reason to get upset.On Friday, Scotland became the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price on alcohol. After six years of public debate (and legal challenges from our benevolent drinks lobby), the new legislation finally came into effect. Unsurprisingly, it has ided opinion.Yet there remains an elusive force at play in the public conversation about alcohol. Namely, the fact that so many of us who drink too much are either unaware of it or are in some form of denial.Being a recovered alcoholic, this tendency towards some form of self-deception – whether rounding down how many glasses of wine you had with dinner or flat-out lying about how much money you blew on a night out – is something I can identify with. We tend to downplay or underestimate both how much we drink and the impact it has on our finances and mental health – which is why facts are useful when creating policies that are designed to tackle the issue. And, like many of the hard drinkers up in arms about minimum pricing, the facts clearly speak for themselves.Sadly, many critics of the policy are focused on the cost to them personally. But even then, as with the uproar when producers of Irn Bru were mandated to stop putting our body weight in sugar into their drinks, or when smokers were unceremoniously chucked out on the street for a few minutes to smoke their cigarettes, or when a certain teacake manufacturer was boycotted for not being Scottish enough, the impact of minimum pricing has been hysterically overstated.If people drink within the recommended guidelines, then the cost is nothing to worry about. It’s only when you buy large volumes of alcohol that the financial burden begins to accumulate. You’ll hear people claim, with a straight face: “This won’t stop hardcore drinkers, but it will stop me.” Which is to miss the point entirely.Research conducted by the University of Sheffield in 2016 estimated that the minimum price of 50p per unit (what we now have in Scotland) could cut alcohol related deaths by 60 in the first year and 120 by year 20 of the policy. Hospital admissions could fall by 1,300 in the first year and 2,000 by year 20. The financial saving from harm reduction could be as much as £942m per year.Sceptics claim the measure won’t deter many alcoholics, implying that something already exists that is capable of such a feat. As someone who falls squarely into that alcoholic category, I can tell you that the threat of financial ruin – among other things – certainly gave me pause for thought.We don’t throw out the rules of the road because some people choose not to abide by them. This is about policy that influences human behaviour over a long period. This is about looking beyond the horizon line of our current culture of excess, to a society where getting paralytic is no longer regarded as a harmless rite of passage.When a fast car slows down at a crossing, the driver isn’t stopping simply because of the red light. They stop due to a combination of forces. A foot on a brake pedal, the friction of the road on the tyres as well as a speed limit. We also have various cultural factors that exert a certain gravity over a motorist’s thinking and behaviour as well, like the fear of getting points on a licence for using a phone or drink-driving.Of course, these rules will never eliminate dangerous driving, and many safe drivers will inevitably feel put-out, believing such rules should not apply to them, but the cumulative effect of all these factors is safer roads for everyone.Minimum pricing exerts an additional drag-force over a certain type of drinker, making it that bit less easy to misuse alcohol. It’s that simple. It won’t solve every drink-related problem, just as airbags, seatbelts and baby seats don’t save everyone from road accidents, but as part of a combination of measures, minimum pricing will play a significant part in tackling alcohol misuse.If it only leads to some people drinking a little less, the cumulative impact of a moderate reduction, both at the level of the inidual and society, could be massive.The only question left for the Scottish government is what they intend to do about the root cause of so much alcoholism: poverty.• Darren McGarvey is author of Poverty Safari"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c000486b408bbd72cecbfd26156b41679e389eb/0_238_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=259b87f7773012d1473735cedb607003","title":"state secret kidnaps children herefordshire council","story":"Imagine you’re a single mother. You get injured in a car accident, and a kind friend offers to look after your two young boys while you’re in\u0026nbsphospital. You accept with relief. Three weeks later, when you get home, you’re still a bit shaky, so your friend suggests it might be best if she has the boys for another few days. You are unsure, but she is persuasive. First thing on Friday you send a text saying you will pick them up from school. A few hours later – you’ve been awaiting her reply, slightly puzzled at the delay – a text\u0026nbsppings back: they are really looking forward to the fun weekend she has planned. How about revisiting the situation on Monday?With mounting unease and some anger you race over and tell her the kids are coming home with you. You are met with a smiling refusal. Until she feels that you are well enough, she explains calmly, they are staying with her. Then she bundles them into her car and heads off to a holiday camp. Presumably at this point you would call the police. Given that there are laws in this country about kidnap, you would get your children back pronto, and your “friend” would be in serious trouble.Kidnap is not a crime typically associated with Britain. But it is happening, right now, and the local authorities involved don’t want you to know. High court judge Mr\u0026nbspJustice Keehan, in a scathing judgment earlier this year at Nottingham family court, revealed that at least 16 children have been “wrongly and abusively” looked after by Herefordshire council, under something called a section 20 arrangement, for “wholly inappropriate” periods of time. For one boy, that was the first nine years of his life after he was born to his 14-year-old mother. For another boy it was eight years, from the age of eight to 16, despite his mother on several occasions withdrawing her consent. Shockingly, at the time of the judgment, 14 children were still being wrongfully looked after by Herefordshire on section 20 arrangements, despite the local authority knowing full well the judge’s displeasure.These are not court orders. They must be a voluntary agreement, and in legal terms they precisely mirror the situation where the single parent consented (at first) to her friend looking after her boys. For a section 20 to be legal, social workers must be certain they have a parent’s informed consent to their child being accommodated by the state. And a parent can withdraw consent at any time, because they keep full parental responsibility. If Mum or Dad wants to turn up at a foster carer’s house at midnight without notice and take their child home, they can. No ifs, no buts. But many parents say social workers threaten that if they do, it will mean a trip to court for a care order. There is no surer way to scare the living daylights out of a parent. And so frightened acquiescence – not the same as consent – tends to be the result.The sheer scale of the section 20 abuses revealed in Keehan’s judgment dwarfs many other egregious instances of its misuse that have been detailed in a slew of judgments published by outraged judges over the past few years. Given the substantial publicity these judicial criticismshave had in the social work and legal press, it is difficult to see how social workers in good faith can plead ignorance of the law. The only alternative is that they are recklessly, even deliberately, choosing to flout it. Despite the fact that one boy’s mother withdrew her consent to section 20 accommodation, Herefordshire’s children’s services deliberately chose not to follow the council’s legal officers’ repeated advice that a care order should be sought if it was thought the boy should remain in foster care.In the case of the boy who was on a section 20 for the first nine years of his life, the judge observed that repeated recommendations made by his independent reviewing officer that his case should be brought before a court were ignored by those above her. Added to this miserable litany of failure, Herefordshire council also accepted that it had “not respected” his 14-year-old mother’s human rights as a vulnerable child herself: it’s doubtful, at the age she gave birth, whether she could have given informed consent. Grasping this surely shouldn’t require a forensic understanding of children’s rights: basic common sense would do.The poet Lemn Sissay recently agreed to accept a compensation package from Wigan council for the abuses he suffered as a child while in its care. Despite his\u0026nbspmother writing letters begging the council to return her baby once she was better able to look after him, he would not be reunited with her until he was in\u0026nbsphis late 20s. That was years ago, but abuses of power\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspstill continuing today.Social workers must stop acting as if they are above the law. In reporting on family cases, I have observed the most extraordinary sense of entitlement and arrogance both in court hearings and in email communications when attempting to investigate and highlight poor and unlawful practice. There is no humility. There is instead a knee-jerk opposition to anyone presuming to want to hold a local authority publicly to account. Given\u0026nbspthat family cases are heard in private, if\u0026nbspthe judge had not rejected the council’s plea to keep its identity secret, nobody would ever have known about the longstanding and outrageous failings of Herefordshire’s social work team. Why, just because the state is the “corporate parent”, should it usually get a free pass on scrutiny and accountability?Kidnapping children is wrong, whoever does it. When\u0026nbspit is the state, which then argues for its transgressions to remain secret in the family courts, it is terrifying. There are growing calls for these courts to lose the privilege of privacy that child protection professionals have benefited from for so long – because how many more human rights abuses are being hidden from view when judges opt not to publish judgments, and when journalists who go to family courts are not allowed report what they see?• Louise Tickle is a freelance journalist who writes on education, social affairs and family law"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2251bfce88bb4ec6efddb551fe981066d2c8edc8/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ef1aad9bbc830bcfcd57c8af2f2d00a9 1290w","title":"american horror story and joan collins are made for each other","story":"The award-winning TV series has done much for underused older actors, but of them all, Collins could turn her newly announced role into a career highlightEveryone should be pleased that Joan Collins has secured a role on the new series of American Horror Story. Joan Collins herself should be pleased, because a spot on an internationally successful TV series will be much more rewarding than, say, a cameo in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie. Joan Collins fans should be similarly pleased, because this is a wonderful opportunity to witness more of her haughty, disdainful press interviews. Most of all, though, older female actors should be absolutely thrilled by this news.Because American Horror Story is picking up a reputation as a safe haven for actors of a certain age. Just look what it did for Jessica Lange. Prior to American Horror Story she was going through all the same motions as countless other fading starlets before her, pinging between bit-parts and TV movies as Hollywood’s voracious gaze passed her by in favour of younger models. But although on paper it’s a schlocky genre piece, American Horror Story handed her the role of a lifetime. And then another one. And then another one. She played an eccentric neighbour a vicious nun who runs an asylum a witch and the all-singing, all-dancing leader of a freak show. It was the showcase that had always eluded her, and she sank her teeth into it for everything she was worth. In Asylum, she got to perform powerful, emotive monologues. In Coven, she got to play glamorous. And in Freak Show, well, there aren’t a lot of shows that require you to belt out David Bowie songs in broad German accents to a two-headed woman. It paid off. Lange won Emmys and Critics’ Choice awards and Dorian awards and SAG awards for her various American Horror Story roles, and this appears to have ushered in a new wave of plum roles for semi-forgotten female actors. The programme has since used Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett to similar effect. Ryan Murphy brought back Lange to play Joan Crawford in Feud, along with Susan Sarandon, who hadn’t visibly had that much fun in 25 years. Fargo and Legion have made better use of Jean Smart than anyone else in years, and Judith Light has long been the best thing about Transparent. Meanwhile, Netflix’s Grace and Frankie has become the sort of vehicle that Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin have deserved forever, and their near-constant presence on best actress shortlists should come as no surprise.It finally feels as if TV is discovering the worth of older actors. A decade ago, or maybe even less, the best these women could expect to be offered was minuscule, underwritten parts as mothers and grandmothers nothingy Modern Family cameos, such as the ones Shelley Long has to endure, or terrible B-movie stints like Kelly McGillis’ part in Supergator. Now, though, slowly but surely, they’re receiving roles they actually deserve. Big, real, knotty, distinguished roles that understand how to get the best out of them. Finally, they’re getting their dues.American Horror Story isn’t stupid. It will have thoroughly sized up Joan Collins before offering her a role, and you can bet that her character will make the very best of her strengths as an actor. It’s been years since Collins has played anything other than a cartoonish parody of herself, so there’s a very good chance that this will be her meatiest, best-received role in decades. If she has the discipline to knuckle down and do the work, this could be a career highlight for her. But this is still Joan Collins we’re talking about, so if she wants to sack it off and just intimidate the bejesus out of interviewers for the rest of her life instead, you wouldn’t put it past her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8e2b3e763eb7394dc95d980c2b63674d247f938/0_352_5632_3379/master/5632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f5a212b219e820177dcae089bf703c","title":"what to do in vancouver a 48 hour itinerary","story":"A multicultural seaport city with thriving arts and culinary scenes, set against the backdrop of a picturesque mountainscape and coast? It’s no shocker that Vancouver regularly tops lists of the world’s most liveable cities, but where to start if you’ve only got two days in town? MorningStart the day right at cult bakery Purebread in Gaston – an outpost of their popular Whistler address. Earl Grey and lavender scone, lemon chèvre brownies or white chocolate whoopie cookies with your morning coffee? Breakfast of champions. Suitably carbed up, join Talaysay Tours for a kayak trip (April-Sep) – paddling the Salish Sea with an indigenous guide who’ll share aboriginal history and culture with you as you explore the rainforest coast – or a Talking Trees hike (year-round) along the north shore. Learn about the Coast Salish legends of the trees while you discover the plants that were used for food, shelter, art and medicine.Stop for lunch at Tap and Barrel Shipyards for local craft beers and wine on tap, along with sustainable seafood, piled-high pizzas and rice bowls. Keep an eye out for “Mealshare” options on menus across Vancouver that provide a free meal for at-risk youths every time a Mealshare item is ordered.AfternoonYou may be surprised to find that just outside of town you’ll find a peak as tall as Wales’s Snowdon: Grouse Mountain. In summer, the Skyride Surf Adventure lets visitors ride the roof of the gondola as it climbs 1,610 metres to the summit. In winter, there’s a night-time snowshoe walk, illuminated by fairy lights. In every season, it offers spectacular views over the city. Vancouver recently legalised “happy hour”, which has been enthusiastically embraced with most restaurants running a 4-6pm deal and many offering a late-night one, too. Once you’ve scaled Grouse, head downtown for a cut-price drink and snack. Try Joe Fortes for C$5 (£2.80) happy hour beer and “buck-a-shuck” oysters Boulevard for octopus ceviche and C$6 high-balls or headcheese toast and a C$6 Aperol Spritz at Royal Dinette.NightGet the best of this fiercely foodie city through its pop-ups. Swallow Tail offers exciting culinary adventures in unusual locations, often with foraged foods. Elsewhere, Vancouver Foodster’s self-guided Tasting Plates nights are a fun way to eat around a neighbourhood, and the Greasy Spoon Diner series at Save On Meats sees big-name chefs creating upmarket takes on diner classics to raise funds for A Better Life Foundation.MorningBrunch is a big deal in Vancouver. Join the crowds at local favourite Jam for chicken and waffles or pancake-batter-dipped-and-fried sausages drenched in maple butter syrup. A few doors down is also brunch institution Chambar, where waffles – with bacon-caramel or the bon matin plate with eggs, tapenade, ham and cheese – are always just right. Next, head east to explore one of the city’s coolest neighbourhoods, centred around Main Street. Heading south from around E28th Ave, take in the colourful street art left over from the area’s annual mural festival (pictured above) then stop for a bit of shopping in Main Street’s erse indy boutiques. Browse rare vinyl at Red Cat Records, local art and graphic novels at Lucky’s Comics, handmade notebooks and badges at quirky stationery store Regional Assembly of Text and pick up a pretty floral dress or two at The Barefoot Contessa.Refuel at Dock Lunch, a 16-seat spot that looks more like your gran’s front room than a restaurant. Chef-owner Elizabeth Bryan serves up something different almost every day (apart from the non-negotiable Friday meatball banh mi) – check Instagram for the menu. If Dock Lunch is out of space, try the Cascade Room for unpretentious west coast food – the wild sockeye salmon burger is superb.AfternoonKeep cruising down Main for fine art South Main Gallery and contemporary local works and performance at Hot Art Wet City. If you’ve still got the energy, push on to Centre A in Chinatown to explore contemporary Asian art before rewarding yourself for all that culture with craft beer at relaxed Brassneck or locally distilled spirits at Juniper bar.NightFor dinner, check out the West End’s treasure trove of Asian restaurants – you’ll find a deeply satisfying, steaming bowl of ramen on every corner. Alternatively, go ultra-Canadian on your last night at the Timber gastropub, which serves comfort food favourites such as poutine and bison burgers, or try Forage for locally sourced, sustainable fare like Haida Gwaii halibut or foraged stinging nettle risotto.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe847ac2e86c03516703ecb54b35500f7145817/0_9_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1691c8512901a069851466e9012c49e3","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaOn his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country. When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed. The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.  Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”. The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.  Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours. Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto. One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13db697d6353b087fe4ad5d71b85ccf6c2ae77a6/0_343_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10e9e0fd9ddf93726ab15b04cf5750e9","title":"canada is one of the coolest countries on the planet if you want proof take a look at its festivals","story":"From the glamour of the Toronto International Film Festival to the freewheeling Halifax Pop Explosion, Canada’s erse, culturally dynamic population knows how to party. Get in on the action with our four favourite Canadian festivalsWhen Miguel Zamora Sanchez first arrived in Toronto after moving from his native Mexico, he was immediately struck by the city’s ersity. “The first weekend I was here it was the gay pride parade,” says the student. “And that same day I saw a jazz festival – it was spread out through the entire city.”It may all have been new to Sanchez at the time, but this will come as no surprise to anyone that’s spent much time in the country. Canadians have a long history of celebrating art and culture, resulting in a vibrant, varied, year-round festival calendar up there with the world’s best. Take the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), which began in 1976 and attracted more than 30,000 attendees in its inaugural year. It is now one of the film industry’s highest-profile events (considered by many in Hollywood to be second only to Cannes in terms of headline premiere screenings and star power) and one of the largest publicly attended film festivals in the world – with almost 400 movies being screened and as many as 480,000 people attending.Piers Handling, director and CEO of TIFF, believes the city’s erse, multicultural population is the spine of the festival’s success. Despite the many A-listers that flock to the city every autumn for the festival – bringing the eyes of the world with them – TIFF thrives because of the people that call Toronto their home all year.“What makes the festival cool is the public,” says Handling. “It’s a very warm, welcoming and erse public. They’re not judgemental. They’re very, very open. They’re not cynical. They’re incredibly curious. So many film-makers have said that it’s the best public to show their film to for the first time.”That openness and cultural savvy isn’t just limited to film, either. Five years ago, Field Trip, an annual summer music festival that hosts approximately 10,000 visitors a day at historic Fort York in downtown Toronto, was launched. While it can be difficult for a new festival to find its footing with so many other competing brands and approaches, Field Trip has thrived because it aims to welcome a broad demographic – not just younger tastemakers.“One of the strengths of the festival is that it’s very community focused,” says Field Trips’s co-director Aaron Miller. “It’s family focused.”Held over two days in June (2-3 June 2018), the festival has brought celebrated acts such as the National and Phoenix – as well as homegrown talents Broken Social Scene and Feist – to Fort York, but still strives to curate a programme that appeals to all ages. “It’s the ersity and the inclusiveness,” Miller says of what makes the festival “cool”. “Those are obviously buzzwords that are associated with Toronto. No place is perfect and this city, like many others, has a lot of work to do. But, ultimately, Toronto does do a pretty good job of celebrating ersity. That ethos is what Field Trip really grabs on to.”Hundreds of miles away from Toronto, the port city of Halifax is also enjoying a flourishing creative movement that hinges on its ersity. Once known as Seattle of the North for its thriving grunge scene in the early 90s, the Nova Scotian capital now prides itself on attracting a wide variety of creative types.“We’re a real hub for artists and left-wing thinkers and people that want to express themselves,” says James Boyle, executive director of Halifax Pop Explosion, a multi-day music festival and conference.Boyle describes Halifax as “a melting pot of different perspectives, ideas and communities” and lauds the rich history of the African Nova Scotian community, the strength of its indigenous community and high student population as the main sources of this distinct outlook. “It’s a hub for ideas and music to flourish,” he says. “That’s why we have so many different genres of music. The city has become that place where people can come and speak their mind and push their ideas forward.”And it’s the festival-goers who reap the rewards of this freewheeling, inclusive approach, with an ever-expanding lineup of interesting, critically acclaimed acts.But few festivals can lay claim to the kind of heavy-hitting programme that Festival d’été in Quebec City offers. One of Canada’s largest music festivals, hundreds of artists play at the 11-day festival each year. Celebrating its 50th anniversary last year, it’s played host to the Rolling Stones, Metallica, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga in the past four years alone. But despite the monumental acts that the festival attracts, Luci Tremblay, communications director at Festival d’été, echoes Handling’s belief that the home audience is the most integral part of the festival’s success.“The people of Quebec make Festival d’été cool because the people of Quebec are cool,” she says. “The festival belongs to them, they are defending it, they love it. Summer here is short. It’s not always warm. So the people of Quebec, as soon as it gets warm, they want to get out. So they add that spirit to the festival and that’s what makes it unique.”“The artists are discovering something,” Tremblay says of the many big names who have played the festival. “When they arrive, they discover how big the festival is and they see the huge stage we have on the Plains of Abraham, which can hold up to 100,000 people – I remember Billy Joel saying that he’d been doing this job for 50 years and he wondered why he’d never come here. It’s always a discovery like that.”For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e70765116b8f0847ead3970a60e7167b0d174a/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a0cb22f7d60ed079dd4316381944bb2","title":"recycle the weetabix what i learned from a month on the app that tackles food waste","story":"I am walking with a woman named Kerry, whom I have just met, to her car. She is in her mid-30s and has a tinge of attitude. When we reach her car, she opens the boot. Inside are hundreds of industrial-sized tubs of hummus, enough to power Brighton for a week.I met Kerry online, not via some kind of hummus-appreciation society messageboard, but on Olio, an app that is attempting to end food waste at home by letting people upload details of the food they would otherwise chuck out, so that others living nearby can take it off their hands. I am trying out the app for a few weeks to see if it can reduce my own waste to zero (and to see if I can get some freebies).For members willing to take things to the next level, like Kerry, they also have a “food waste heroes” programme, where volunteers offer to pick things up from cafes and shops and list this food on the site. After picking up these hummus tubs from a supplier that had no use for them, Kerry is now spending one of the hottest days of the year shepherding people to and from her car. She was disappointed when I said said I could only take four – “Are you sure your friends and family wouldn’t want some?”Most hot-button environmental issues have to go on a journey, from being pipe dreams discussed in the furthest reaches of the Glastonbury green fields to a central plank of government policy. Climate change, non-GM food, plastic pollution – they were all once dismissed as fringe politics, until the government and industry suddenly got on board. For food waste, it seems as though that moment is now. In the past six months, Tesco has reduced all edible food waste to zero, Co-op is trialling the sale of products that have passed their best before date and the EU has announced that, for the first time, it is forcing member states to report on how much food is wasted each year, with the goal to halve waste by 2030.Launched in 2015, Olio feels part of this sea-change in our attitude to waste. The app was started by Tessa Cook and Saasha Celestial-One (the latter’s names come from her Iowa-hippy parents – although she rebelled by becoming an investment banker). Cook was previously managing director at Wonga, the controversial payday loans firm. She grew up on a farm in North Yorkshire, and says she got the idea after being left with a few sweet potatoes and a cabbage on the day she was moving back to the UK from Switzerland. It was not feasible to take them with her, but knowing how much work had gone into growing fresh produce she couldn’t bring herself to chuck them out. Like so many tech-inventors of the modern era, she thought: there should be an app for that.I have to admit I was part of the problem. When I first moved out of home, I chucked out food even if it seemed fine, because I couldn’t remember how long ago I bought it. I would get lots of ingredients for a complicated recipe, use a teaspoon of each and then leave them in the fridge till they went off – not knowing what else to do with the remainder.When my partner, who works in food, first moved in, she was horrified. I was instructed that the kitchen had to change: uneaten bananas would be chopped up in the freezer for smoothies, leftover milk gets turned into labneh even the rind of the parmesan will be frozen to later be chucked into a minestrone. The kitchen became entirely refocused. The first question when cooking is not “what do you want to eat?” but “what have we got to use up”.Now I’m a fully paid-up member of the anti-food-waste brigade, Olio was an obvious thing to try out. After downloading the app, I immediately find plenty of listings, although a lot of them are more than 2km away, which seems quite a schlep to pick up a few carrots. There are a few single pastries, a half-eaten birthday cake and five leftover pieces of fried chicken. Mostly though, there’s just lots of white bread – packets and packets of half-eaten Kingsmill. I’m considering making a bread and butter pudding for the first time in my life but then I see the hummus stash pop up and my Olio journey begins.Inspired by my early score, I try to find some things to list myself, although our waste-not-want-not regime doesn’t leave much going spare. Eventually I find a packet of unwanted Weetabix, left behind by a previous flatmate. I put it on the site and await a response.One came within minutes – he said he could be over soon. The man who arrived told me that he had been using the app nearly everyday: he has a big family, none of whom are working much, and Olio can be a lifesaver. He says these days he doesn’t really leave the house unless it is to pick something up from Olio or go shopping. We talk about his struggles finding work, his depression, run-ins with the police and issues among his family. I realise it is probably the longest conversation I have had with a stranger from my area. After 80 minutes of chatting, he asked if I had any other food I could give him – I said I would have a look around and let him know. It’s an odd feeling: was I helping? Is it patronising? How could I ever let anyone else on the site pick something up from me now, when this man was in such need?Olio’s online spiel is similar to a lot of companies that believe technology can change the world. Its positioning feels aspirational, with neighbours working together.The initial trial for the app took place among 12 people in Crouch End the first item to be shared was half a bag of shallots. But what quickly becomes apparent is that many of the people on Olio are using it as an alternative or supplementary food bank.I put it to Cook that the app exists on two different levels: one for a well-meaning middle class, with food leftover from fashion shoots or Sunday dinner, and then people who are travelling a long way to pick up not very much food at all.“What has been quite shocking for us to discover on this journey, is how many hungry people there are in this country,” Cook says. “I’ll be very honest, I had no idea and I think many people have no idea. Since working on Olio, I have learnt that 8.4 million people are living in food insecurity. We have found that around a third of our regular requestors are living in poverty. What I’ve heard from a lot of those people is that what they love about the app is that there is no stigma when they collect food.”Isn’t there something a little uncomfortable, though, about those with too much giving their scraps to those with too little? “We don’t like to think of it as the haves giving to the have-nots. Actually this is just part of modern everyday communities, it’s absolute madness that people are throwing away perfectly delicious food on the one hand, while living nearby are people who would like that food or perhaps even need that food.”Over the next few weeks, I continue to use the app, mostly for non-food items. I give away a lampshade to one man called Ty and some toiletries to another called Ramneek – both twentysomething locals who say they have been on the app for a while, just doing their bit to reduce waste. I also pick up an old milk-bottle collector that I have repurposed into a shower caddy.But most of the time I look on Olio, the pickings are relatively slim. Desirable items go very quickly and most are far away. I also decide that it is not right to pick up ready-to-eat food such as sandwiches and pastries, which make up a lot of the listings, when there are people using the app in serious need.Olio claims to be the biggest food-sharing network in the world. More than 500,000 items have been shared in more than 40 countries. It is a pretty good start for an app that has only been going for a few years, but it feels like a drop in the ocean considering how much is wasted each day.It is a bold ambition and they are a long way off, especially considering that they are far from the only organisation aiming to tackle this problem. FareShare, Wrap, Freegle, Food Cycle and The Felix Project are just some of the groups trying to help ease the food waste problem. Still, Olio can provide food that some charities wouldn’t bother with – lots of listings on the site are for a couple of potatoes or half a sandwich.In recent weeks, plastics have been top of the agenda when it comes to new environmental policy, with the biggest food companies agreeing to end the use of non-recyclable packaging. This move should be taken as a sign of willingness to change – but food waste is arguably a more critical concern, because it is connected to so many modern afflictions: hunger, greenhouse gases, waste disposal and escalating food prices.And this is where there is an opportunity. It is not really the interface that matters: it can be a charity, an app or just a WhatsApp group between five people in a village, but if people are able to shake off the stigma about passing on the food they don’t want, they might help to fix a bunch of the world’s problems at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9292906588b4c57703367793ead34ecf4c98b2fe/0_0_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b70377fd507d0b22d52d318e55b771c","title":"loyalty to navy shirts means monagamous relationshps","story":"Fidelity is not the only benefit of being with a man who is loyal to navy T-shirts. According to our fashion fixer, he can use the time saved to bring you tea in bedMy partner only wears navy T-shirts and jeans on weekdays. Is his fashion monogamy a good sign for us, or is he going to have a midlife crisis and buy a pair of cerise jorts? Helen, LondonI’ll be honest, Helen, I hadn’t previously considered the correlation between fashion and fidelity, but I do think you have a point here. After all, in my experience, contrary to all those women’s magazineDaily Mail headlines of the “What every woman should know to keep their man!!!” variety, most males are deeply monogamous in nature. Buckle up, everyone, while we enter the galaxy of … Sweeping Gender Generalisations!From my vantage point, at the coalface of gender observations, the majority of men, once they’re in a relationship for the long haul, just want to bed in. By which I mean they don’t want to have to make the kinds of efforts they once made when they were single. They get a bit fat, they go a bit bald, and that’s just fine with them because they’ve had enough of the hassle that they think goes into impressing prospective paramours. They’ve got their partner so can they just get some takeaway, watch Netflix and let their bellies flop over their jeans with secret elasticated waist, please? This explains why, over the age of 35, men tend to settle into a daily uniform, whether that’s a suit or (bad) jeans, (worse) khakis and neutral – meaning blue, white or tartan – shirts (men, for some reason, consider tartan to be a neutral on a button-down shirt, similar to the way women think of leopard print as a neutral when it’s on anything).This also explains why often the most untrustworthy men are the ones with the most inconsistent dress sense. I mean, look at Gavin Rossdale: one day a sexually ambiguous goth, the next a grunge rocker, the next a trendy Silverlake dad. Anyone could see which way this was going and, allegedly, it was going straight to shagging the nanny. Or Ben Affleck, who for years couldn’t figure out if he was a hunky leading man or an edgy indie director, and his oscillating clothing choices reflected that. He is now nicely settled into a T-shirt-wearing, fortysomething-dad groove but, alas, it allegedly took dating the nanny to find it. True, Donald Trump has been wearing suits since he was three years old and has probably grabbed the pussy of every pussy-possessing person who crossed his path. But then, there’s a consistency to that, as much as there is in his wardrobe.So what I’m saying, Helen, is I see nothing but promise in a partner who settles into a work uniform pretty much two minutes after getting married. He has found his thing and he’s sticking with it and I’m afraid that by “thing”, in this instance, I mean both the navy T-shirts and you. But, as we’ve already discussed, blue T-shirts are pretty much man’s greatest invention in many men’s eyes, so take it as a compliment.I think there are a lot of advantages to being with a man who wears the same thing every day, beyond the reassurance of fidelity. The primary one is with the time he saves in the morning by not having to decide what to wear, he can bring you tea in bed. But I would suggest he reassure his colleagues he’s not wearing the actual same clothes every day. Perhaps you could get some cards printed up for him to hand round the office.As for your fear of cerise jorts, I understand the concern, but I think it is misplaced. For a start, I strongly suspect a man who wears navy every day doesn’t even know what cerise is, let alone jorts, so this would be like worrying about him running off with Dua Lipa. He would need to Google just to get started here, so let’s not waste time worrying about the non-existent.At most, he might dally with what I call “man ‘fashion’”. These are fashion twists that conservative men allow themselves to indulge in because they think they are fun and they convince themselves they don’t threaten their masculinity. Absurd shoes are very much man fashion, as are watches, oddly patterned button-down shirts and waistcoats. Do not worry: this is just the sartorial equivalent of your partner getting a harmless little hobby, like fly fishing, or Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons. At heart, he’s still your navy T-shirted guy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6fb5b467938a850c8830c1cd182da3190dca84a/22_0_655_393/master/655.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a74242012919f44f753e0f9de03ba9e7","title":"berlusconi biopic loro is a tender look at the weaknesses of an old man paolo sorrentino","story":"Director Paolo Sorrentino defends sexually explosive portrait of former prime minister, which has been called ‘a porn film without a moral issue’Steamy sex, exotic dancers, cocaine sniffing and raucous poolside parties – the life and times of Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi would appear to be natural material for a biopic. Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino has taken up the challenge, and the first instalment of his two-part film Loro (Them) was released in Italian cinemas on 24 April. The second part is due on 10 May.Describing the inspiration behind Loro at last year’s Cannes film festival, Sorrentino said he wanted to “make a film about Italians … Berlusconi is the archetype of ‘Italianness’ and through him I can tell the Italians’ story.”But if Loro’s first half is anything to go by, the film is mostly an account of the sordid, power-hungry personalities who orbited around the billionaire. Berlusconi is played by Toni Servillo, a long-term collaborator who was also cast as the playboy protagonist in Sorrentino’s 2014 Academy award-winning film The Great Beauty, only makes an appearance towards the end of Loro 1. Sorrentino clarified his earlier comments at a press conference following a screening of Loro 2 in Rome on 2 May. “The film is a take on power and characteristics during the 2006 to 2010 period,” he said. “In part, it is about characteristics that Italians have, but it’s not a film about Italians.”What Italians will recognise is an era of politics the majority are embarrassed by and people they would rather forget. The central character in Loro 1 is a pimp from southern Italy called Sergio Morra, played by Riccardo Scamarcio, who longs to get close to Berlusconi. Italians will likely compare the character with Gianpaolo Tarantini, a businessman who was convicted in 2015 of procuring prostitutes for Berlusconi’s parties in the hope of winning lucrative public contracts.Loro covers the period between 2006, when Berlusconi’s second term as prime minister came to an end, and 2010, two years after he began his third stint (and a year before he was forced to resign amid an acute debt crisis).Sorrentino steers clear of politics in the film, mainly alluding to it as part of Berlusconi’s rampant ambition, which is summed up neatly when his character is asked: “What did you expect: to be the richest man in the country, become prime minister and be madly loved by everyone too?” He replies: “Yes, that’s exactly what I expected.”Loro 2 sees Sorrentino endeavour to understand the complex personality and emotions of Berlusconi during a tumultuous period in his career and as his marriage to second wife Veronica Lario, played by Elena Sofia Ricci, stutters towards an end.“Loro is neither pro- or anti-Berlusconi,” Sorrentino said. “It is instead a tender look at the weaknesses of an old man.”Servillo has been praised for his portrayal of Berlusconi, but reviews for Loro 1 have been mostly negative. Writing in La Repubblica, Emiliano Morreale described it as “lopsided and disharmonious”, while Paolo Mereghetti of Corriere della Sera said it was “a cross between farce and tenderness”. Giovanni Robertini, of Rolling Stone Italia, likened it to “a porn film without a moral issue”. Box-office takings also reflect lack of enthusiasm for the film when compared to his previous: Loro 1 made €1.7m in its first week, much less than The Great Beauty and 2015’s Youth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457fcf48942f4202818920afd1eda0c4ab4e1725/0_152_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad7cac216d631436efa702b9d34c3547","title":"i feel pretty review amy schumer","story":"The Trainwreck star is never able to reach her toe-curling best in this tale of an office worker who suddenly sees herself anewOn paper, this should be the perfect showcase for Amy Schumer: the title is taken from that girlishly hopeful song in the 1961 musical West Side Story delivered by Natalie Wood, whose gamine image is of course so different from Schumer’s. Yet at almost every stage, Schumer’s routine is weirdly restrained and inhibited due to the film’s high concept: that she becomes an aspirational success, against all the odds. It’s a plot imperative that works against the disaster, embarrassment and cynicism integral to Amy Schumer’s comedy.The film is written by the romcom veterans Marc Silverstein and Abby Kohn, with obvious borrowings from The Devil Wears Prada and Ugly Betty they are making their joint feature directing debut, and Schumer has a producer credit. She plays Renee, who works in the online delivery unit of a big New York fashion brand, stuck in a dull office well away from the super-prestigious Fifth Avenue building. She is a woman who is insidiously made to feel ashamed of her bigger size by the patriarchal body-image imposed by the worlds of media and fashion, and by the impossibly slim women surrounding her at the gym. One day she hits her head during spin class and wakes up believing that she is a size zero babe and the resulting delusional aura of confidence – together with the fact that her fashion brand is trying to reach out to “ordinary” women – means she gets a top job there. Actually, Schumer is pretty, and the casting wouldn’t work otherwise, but despite the disconnect between how she is portrayed and how she feels, she is never really abashed and there is no comic friction. In fact, it is more a parable of how celebrities like Schumer, on becoming successful, suddenly get an inkling of how beautiful people have always felt. I Feel Famous would be an alternative title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0cfad6baeb7dd704ff9e5f714130a19ac9b093/0_101_2010_1206/master/2010.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8ea18fb78619a5133922b68cc99120","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp champions league roma real madrid","story":"• Manager admits Liverpool were lucky in second leg• Roma president furious at referee over penalty claimsA beaming Jürgen Klopp told his Liverpool side they must go and finish the job in Kiev by winning the Champions League after surviving their Roma scare. Liverpool were beaten 4-2 at Stadio Olimpico, their first defeat in Rome, but advanced 7-6 on aggregate to the final where they will face Real Madrid.And the Liverpool manager warned the holders that his team will be “on fire” in Ukraine having weathered another Roma recovery in the second leg of the semi-final. Klopp, who re-emerged from the tunnel to celebrate with the 5,000 delirious away fans half an hour after the final whistle, admitted his team had suffered and under-performed in the Italian capital. Not that he cared. Having guided Liverpool from the Champions League qualifiers to their eighth European Cup final appearance Klopp insisted his only focus was on ending a run of near-misses in finals and Real’s hold on the trophy on 26 May.“We were in a League Cup final and didn’t win it,” the Liverpool manager said. “People don’t tell me in the street since then: ‘Thank you for bringing us to the final.’ We were in the Europa League final too. Nobody tells me thank you. I see no trophies after these games. They don’t hang silver medals at Melwood. That’s a pity, but that’s the game. There’s still a job to do.Klopp joined his players in prolonged celebrations with the Liverpool supporters at the Stadio Olimpico. He later came back out to continue the revelry alone. He explained: “Seeing all these happy faces is the best thing that football can do. These people followed us all over Europe, come to Anfield, create an exceptional atmosphere, and we all know how big the desire is to come back on the winning track. They had such a big part in the season so far so if they want to see me, they can see me, no problem.”The Liverpool manager said his team were made to suffer by Roma because they did not capitalise on several counterattacks. “A big compliment for Roma,” added Klopp. “What a performance, what a comeback, what a great football game. In the high-intense moments we had brilliant counterattacks but not enough to finish them. There was a few penalty situations but I didn’t see them back so far. It was first time we were not as good as we can be.“We needed luck, that’s what we had, and over the whole campaign it’s deserved. It would have been deserved for Roma too. For both teams it would have been crazy to play extra time. So it was 7-6 on aggregate, which sounds crazy because it is crazy.“We came as a qualifier and are now in a final. I’m really happy for the boys, the club, the fans. It’s been a fantastic ride so far now we go to Kiev, which sounds crazy but it’s the truth. We will go to Kiev.”The Roma president, James Pallotta, was livid with the Slovenian referee Damir Skomina, insisting his refusal to award a penalty for handball by Trent Alexander-Arnold or dismiss Loris Karius for a foul on Edin Dzeko made the introduction of VAR an imperative in the Champions League.“I know it is difficult to ref but it is really embarrassing that we lose on aggregate like that. By the way, it should have been a red card which would have been 10 men in the 63rd minute. Liverpool are a great team, congratulations going forward, but if they don’t get VAR in the Champions League, stuff like this is an absolute joke,” Pallotta said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8788f31982c02f3de5ff73ef7aac3c3a7962b0ac/0_154_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83c75972e3122a6c75cda48b8494ccf5","title":"roma liverpool champions league semi final second leg match report","story":"Is it too presumptuous, when Liverpool have conjured up so many thrilling occasions en route to the Champions League final, to believe they might just have the attacking riches to prevent Real Madrid, the most successful team in the history of the European Cup, from registering a 13th triumph? The final will be on 26 May in Kiev and Liverpool, on this evidence, will be heading to Ukraine to score goals, live dangerously and examine the theory that Madrid can be susceptible at the back.Evidently, Jürgen Klopp’s team will need to tighten up their own defence, eliminate the mistakes that briefly threatened a late meltdown and cling to the hope their goalkeeper, Loris Karius, avoids one of his more accident-prone performances. Attacking-wise, though, it is certainly within their reach to ensure another year, 2018, is added to all those banners on the Kop – many of them visible here in Rome – acclaiming their previous wins in 1977, 78, 81, 84 and 2005. Klopp’s team have now accumulated 46 goals, qualifiers included, in this competition and Sadio Mané, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino have 31 of them. True, they will need to find a way to subdue Cristiano Ronaldo et al but if there is one certainty about this Liverpool side it is that they will attack with vigour and confidence.That approach was too much ultimately for Roma and, though it was a night of high drama, it was only in the final exchanges that Radja Nainggolan’s two goals meant Liverpool’s aggregate lead was down to one. Even then Roma did not actually manage another touch after Nainggolan’s stoppage-time penalty had made it 4-2. The game kicked off again, the final whistle sounded straight away and Klopp was charging on to the pitch to bearhug his players, one by one, starting with James Milner.There were wonderful scenes as the players celebrated in front of the corner where Liverpool’s supporters were going through their victory songs. There was even a team photograph which featured a touching tribute to Sean Cox, the Liverpool supporter so badly hurt last week. Despite the defeat, it felt like we were witnessing a group of players who had come of age. Barcelona, lest it be forgotten, had buckled under the pressure here, blowing a 4-1 first-leg lead in the quarter-finals. The score might suggest Liverpool almost did the same and, granted, it was closer than Klopp must have imagined after the first‑half goals from Mané and Georginio Wijnaldum.In truth, it was never really in doubt that it would be Liverpool in the final. That does not mean Klopp can be entirely happy with their performance bearing in mind the three second-half goals they conceded, the eccentric goalkeeping from Karius for Roma’s third goal and the two occasions in the same period when Serie A’s third-placed team should have been awarded a penalty. Roma gave everything and had a raucous crowd willing them on.Anfield was special for the first leg. Stadio Olimpico, a seething, whistling pit of bias, somehow managed to make even more of a racket. Of all the places Liverpool have been in this competition, all the stories they have accumulated over the years, have they ever experienced such a febrile din?That, however, was probably the most impressive part of Liverpool’s performance: their fearlessness. Roma’s record of having not conceded a single home goal in this competition – some achievement when their opponents have included Barcelona, Chelsea and Atlético Madrid – was gone within eight minutes. Liverpool began the game like a team in a hurry, not showing a flicker of apprehension, and had strong penalty claims of their own because of two Kostas Manolas challenges either side of Mané’s goal.Even when Milner’s freakish own goal offered Roma new hope, there was not a single part of the first half when Liverpool started playing with more restraint. Another side might have tried to draw the sting out of the game. Liverpool refused to sit back and it was typical that the corner for their second goal originated from a surging run by their outstanding left‑back, Andy Robertson. Roma could not clear Milner’s corner and when Edin Dzeko inadvertently headed the ball the wrong way, under pressure from Virgil van Dijk, it was too good an opportunity for Wijnaldum to pass up.Roma kept attacking, desperately trying to change the complexion of the evening, but they were in need of a football miracle and Liverpool had shown with the opening goal how devastating they could be on the break. Roma were vulnerable as soon as Nainggolan played the ball straight to Firmino. Mané was running to the Brazilian’s left, Salah was going the other way, and there were only three defenders back. Mané took a touch to control Firmino’s pass and fired emphatically past Alisson, Roma’s goalkeeper.Perhaps the second half would have been more hazardous for Liverpool if Stephan El Shaarawy’s 35th-minute shot had crept in rather than coming back off the post. Again Milner was involved, with the shot taking a hefty deflection off the midfielder. This time, however, Milner’s luck was in – in stark contrast to the freakish set of events, a quarter of an hour in, when Dejan Lovren tried to hack away El Shaarawy’s knockdown only for the ball to thud against Milner’s head and zigzag into the net.Roma began the second half knowing they needed four goals, with none in reply, just to take the game to extra-time. At least they had a go. Dzeko had a splendid game, barring the mistake for Wijnaldum’s goal, and made it 2-2 when Karius turned a shot into his path. Dzeko, wrongly flagged offside, should also have been awarded a penalty two minutes earlier when he went down under Karius’s challenge and Liverpool got away with another one when Trent Alexander-Arnold used his hand to block El Shaarawy’s shot.Karius was badly caught out for Nainggolan’s first goal and the penalty was for an alleged handball by the substitute Ragnar Klavan. The damage was superficial and, half an hour after the final whistle, Klopp came out again, pumping his fists and screaming with joy in front of 5,000 euphoric fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c0fb0f0163b6760902977178bbb9a6c403c604a/0_196_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b0cf8e5b5abc15b2d7c512136d5a240","title":"subbuteo first female table football womens fa cup final chelsea arsenal","story":"FA and Hasbro criticised for not making set available to buy - with it only being available to winners on social mediaIt is the football game beloved of parents steeped in nostalgia about the halcyon days of their youth – but now Subbuteo is making a push to move into the 21st century by launching an all-female set before the Women’s FA Cup final on Saturday.The Football Association said the new game reflected the growth of the women’s game in the UK, and would help raise the profile of the sport. The limited edition set will feature 22 players and six substitutes in the colours of finalists Arsenal and Chelsea.But the FA defended the partnership with makers of the traditional football game Hasbro, after it was dismissed by some as a marketing ploy. The set will not be available to buy, but can only be won via FA social channels in the coming months.Sophie Downey, of Girls on the Ball, which produce match reports from women’s games in the UK and across the world, said Hasbro were missing a trick in not making the set available to buy because there was a committed and growing fan base of women’s football who would snap up any merchandise.“Why wouldn’t you make it commercially available? If they say they are supporting the women’s game but then not making it available for fans to buy then that doesn’t really sit right,” she said. “I understand that they maybe want to try it out but I am sure it would prove popular.”Media commentator Mark Borkowski said that the launch was “a publicity stunt”. He added: “If it’s not commercially available, you put it out there to generate a huge amount of media interest, see what the interest is and then, perhaps, produce it further down the line. It’s a well-known, clever, marketing ploy.”A spokesman for the FA denied the all-female set was a gimmick and said the organisation was in discussions with Hasbro about producing a commercially available all-female set. “There are ongoing discussions looking at opportunities going forward,” said a spokesman.A record number of tickets have been sold for the Women’s FA Cup final on Saturday, with more than 40,000 fans expected to descend on Wembley to see the game between Arsenal and Chelsea attracted by free tickets for children, with adults tickets on sale for £15.The game - which will be broadcast live on BBC One from 17:10 BST - will see a repeat of the 2016 final, when Arsenal won the trophy thanks to a single goal from Danielle Carter.Women’s football expert Asif Burnhan noted that companies have regularly found that there was a market for football products aimed at fans of the women’s game. Panini now sell sticker books for both the Women’s World Cup and the Euros, while women’s kits are widely available.“There is a whole generation of young girls following women’s football now who have grown up with female role models, who can buy women’s shirts or have sticker books with female players – but someone has to make the first move or it never happens,” he said.In a statement Marzena Bogdanowicz, the FA’s head of marketing and commercial for women’s football, said the new set – which will feature female players prominently on the box – reflected the “rapid growth” in women’s football in the UK. “We aspire to greater equality all the way from board games to boardrooms, and every day we are striving to transform the future of the women’s game on and off the pitch,” she said.Hasbro’s senior vice president, James Walker, said: “This all-female playset is recognition of the vital role that women’s football has in our culture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55e3ba1597c7e50cd5afd4992f40649d3108abc0/0_141_6640_3985/master/6640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e2368cc15bdf99205d4a939b2ed17a4","title":"frank lampard interview we forget basics respect","story":"The former Chelsea midfielder reveals the principles that guide him and says he is ready to make the move into football management a year since hanging up his bootsIt is easy to imagine that the end of a footballer’s career comes as a massive, debilitating shock, suddenly depriving the player not just of their livelihood but also of routine, friendship, fitness and excitement. A little over a year since that moment came for Frank Lampard, he looks at it a little differently. There have been times, he says, when the sudden change in his life has “smacked me in the face”, but more commonly he has appreciated the release of the pressure accumulated over 21 years at the top of the game. As he plots his return to the sport as a manager, however, he is aware that it is only likely to be temporary.“I didn’t make all the right decisions in my career, far from it, but when I got to the end I felt I’d given it my full whack,” he says. “When you can think: ‘I put everything on the table and that’s my lot,’ I think you have been quite successful. That’s probably what drove me on as a player for quite a long while – I wanted to make sure I took every ounce out of the game and got the most out of myself.“And then it becomes like a relief, when you feel that the work’s done and it wasn’t too bad. I didn’t have too many failures, and I actually did some pretty good stuff. I’m very content with that. I’ve hardly kicked a ball since I finished, and I’ve got no craving to kick a ball. I do other things now.”Lampard won four FA Cups, three league titles, two League Cups and the Champions League and Europa League once each, as well as winning 106 England caps in an international career that stretched for only a few months short of 15 years. “When you’re at a big club, there isn’t much breathing space,” he says. “You’re continuously trying to win things, to perform to the best of your ability, and it can be quite tiring. I’ll be honest, at the end of my career I was ready to move on. In terms of the intense pressure I put on myself for that period of time, I felt ready. I’m asked a lot now: ‘Are you missing football?’ And I’m actually not. I sit here pretty happy with my lot.“When you’re playing you get looked after, you have people around you who completely put you out of the real world, and then the real world hits you smack in the face when you finish. But I was fortunate in that the transition hasn’t been a problem for me. I needed the pause, I really did. I needed the lack of structure in my life for a while. I felt kind of ready for that. It was a necessity for me to get away. It’s been a year and a half, almost, and now I have the hunger. So it’ll come when it comes, if the right opportunity comes for me.”Lampard has remained involved with football, swapping the pitch for punditry while he works on his coaching qualifications – he starts the Pro Licence course in September – and puts what he is learning into practice at Chelsea’s academy. “I’ve picked up a lot in this year, working in the media, travelling around” he says. “You have to do it properly. I don’t just roll up and go: ‘That was a good game.’ You have to look at the players, the tactics.“That’s why I’m not setting a time limit on the move into management. You don’t just flick a switch – you need to learn a lot again. There are no shortcuts as I see it.”Looking back at his playing career, Lampard says that “my biggest talent – or certainly one of them – was my work ethic and dedication”. He spent most of those years primarily focused on himself, on constant betterment. He is conscious, however, that such a mindset cannot survive in management.His favourite coaches as a player, and the ones he wants to emulate, were those best at relating to the different characters in their team, and identifying for each one the approach that brought the greatest reward. “As a player you can be pretty selfish,” he says. “As a manager it’s the complete opposite of that. I’m really interested in the idea of trying to man-manage a group as well as I possibly could, to deal with a real mixed, erse dressing room like we have these days. There’s not one rule for everyone. I read a lot now because I love to find out about how other managers have tackled these things. That’s where the magic is.”Since retirement Lampard has filled what gaps have appeared in his life with travel, leisure and family. There have been no suddenly discovered hobbies or interests, no trips to the golf course. He lives his life according to the principles that drove him throughout his playing career. He has spoken before about his faith, and how it helped him through the death of his mother, a decade ago last week. He describes himself as a “not completely practising” Christian, but his beliefs inform everything he does.“I go about my life in terms of, I try to do everything right. And when I say right, I mean with the right intentions,” he says. “So when I work, I work as hard as I can when I have people around me I try to respect those people. Of course you make mistakes. But as I go through life if I feel like I’m doing it right – and this is what I try to tell my daughters now – then hopefully things will come good for me.“What you put in is what you get out. I think that in modern society – and I’m not preaching here, far from it – we do forget the basics, in terms of manners and respect for the people around you. I got brought up with those things, particularly from my mum, so I try to replicate them as much as I can, and pass them on to my daughters. I certainly don’t feel that I approach life now the way I did when I was 20. But I do treat people as I want to be treated myself, and I try to take that around with me.”Perhaps that is why, for all the time he spent identifying his weaknesses as a footballer and laboriously improving them, for all the caps, trophies and goals, when that time came to an end what he wanted people to remember was something entirely different. “What I would have loved at the end of my career,” he says, “was for someone to just say: ‘He was a good team-mate.’ Not just on the pitch but also as a friend, as a buffer, as a person.”• The ‘Game Changing fans - The 12th Player in every Premier League team’ report by Barclays can be downloaded here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f427d5f63843fb202c47f4eaa18a8c143ae6d7/0_100_5553_3332/master/5553.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5b67f1d91a987d0d8b13995346fc1fc","title":"mo salah egypt pride arabs champions league final","story":"In a coffee-house down a Cairo sidestreet, the Roma v Liverpool game almost starts with a row among the customers. The previous game on the television featuring the local favourites Zamalek risked running into extra time, past kick-off for the Champions League tie. A Zamalek goal in the 89th minute saved any blows: No one wants to miss Mohamed Salah.“He plays in a beautiful way – and he’s always developing,” says Mohammed Hassen, a 23-year-old originally from Sudan but raised in Egypt. “He brings pride to people as he’s a Muslim who’s made it in the top leagues. He brings pride to all Arabs,” he adds.Salah has rapidly reached demi-god level in Egypt because of his performances at Liverpool. His status quickly rose beyond the boundaries of sport, cementing him as a symbol of Egyptian potential and hope even amid a gloomy period for Egypt, with a troubled economy and few outlets for free expression.It is unknown for 50 people to sit in near silence in Cairo, but it seems the Liverpool forward’s presence on screen can achieve that too. They sit quietly, brows furrowed, faces turned upwards towards the screen, the silence broken only by the match commentary and the sound of the ceiling fans hitting the striped canvas that functions as a makeshift roof. Extra chairs are brought in, cigarettes are lit, coffees and sodas are laid out, coals for shisha pipes are heated.Anyone listening hard to the commentary would also be forgiven for thinking that Salah plays in every position, given that the announcers are prone to describing his actions even when he’s nowhere near the ball. At one point, the beIN commentator brands him “Egypt’s new Ramses” and adds that Liverpool should be renamed “Salah-pool”.Twenty minutes into the game, and the tiny alleyway that functions as the coffeehouse is packed – everyone is tense, awaiting a Salah goal. “For God’s sake, give it to Salah,” one man grumbles in frustration.The cafe erupts into cheers for Liverpool’s two early goals (Sadio Mané and Georginio Wijnaldum) but these barely come close to the claps and cheers that come when Salah takes possession of the ball, or is anywhere close to the goal.At the end of the first half, the mood shifts: the patrons no longer want to see Salah score to aide Liverpool, they need to see what he can do to reassure them that their upcoming foray into the World Cup will be a success. Egypt qualified for the first time since 1990, after Salah scored a penalty in the 95th minute against Congo.“I want to see him score two goals,” says Hassen’s friend Abdullah Idris. “Let’s see him finish off Roma,” adds Hassen, at half-time.“I really identify with him – he put in a lot of effort to get where he is,” says Ahmed Said, 21, who skipped work to race to the coffee-house for the second half. Said says he stopped watching football after the 2012 Port Said stadium massacre, which killed 74 football fans, but Salah’s presence convinced him to start watching again. “I’ll watch the World Cup because of him,” he says, sucking on a shisha pipe decorated with Manchester City’s crest.When the match passes without a Salah goal, Said quickly finds a reason. “Salah’s performance wasn’t so great as he’s just under so much pressure,” he explains. “He has all those problems with his sponsor,” he adds, referring to a week of tension between the 25-year-old forward, who has a personal sponsorship deal with one mobile phone company, and the Egyptian Football Association, who used the player’s image to promote a different, government-owned telephone company.Liverpool will head to the Champion’s League final on 26 May against Real Madrid, a conflicting moment for many in the Middle East, where La Liga has long dominated screens. But not so for Hassen, who confesses that even though he’s a long-time Real Madrid fan, he will cheer for Liverpool because of Salah. “The game’s finished for Real Madrid,” he says, smiling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaca9b3198d15d53ef0458f4c71fd7ad4993c4ae/11_109_2906_1743/master/2906.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e30869904b21af96457a9d75c5b122","title":"world cup stunning moments miracle of bern","story":"Hungary were unbeaten in four years. West Germany had no chance. Yet in the 1954 final the underdogs produced one of the great World Cup shocksThe rain was teeming down in Bern and Hungary were about to win the World Cup. Ferenc Puskas had put the Mighty Magyars ahead after six minutes and Zoltan Czibor had doubled the advantage after eight. They were 2-0 up inside 10 minutes and they had not lost in four years. They were 2-0 up inside 10 minutes against a team that they had beaten 8-3 barely a fortnight earlier. They were 2-0 up inside 10 minutes against a side who, four years earlier, did not even exist.What unfolded over the next 80 minutes, if you subscribe to the more romantic interpretations, created one country and fanned the flames of a revolution in another. Even the most mundane reading of events would still need to use the phrase “greatest comeback ever seen in a World Cup final”. Hungary were 2-0 up inside 10 minutes but it was West Germany who were about to win the World Cup.In the inter-war period, German football had been among the strongest in Europe. In 1934 the Mannschaft had finished third at the World Cup, beating the Austrian Wunderteam in the third-place play-off. Three years later Sepp Herberger’s Breslau Elf – monikered after the side who defeated Denmark 8-0 in Breslau – went 11 games undefeated (winning 10) but by 1938 the Anschluss had created a “united” German side that was anything but and the World Cup campaign that year ended at the first hurdle with defeat to the Swiss.Then came war. Football became propaganda. The continuing league system was held up by the Nazi regime as “proof of morale”. Throughout the conflict Herberger, who had been in sole charge of the national side since 1936, would do his best to keep his charges out of harm’s way. When passes back from the front became available only to those decorated in service, the national team manager would falsify documents in order to get his players. And he would do what he could to install members of his squad in positions away from the fronts. Several, Herberger’s golden boy Fritz Walter among them, were wangled comparatively safe jobs at an airforce base, which also just happened to have one of the best football sides in the country.But Herberger’s best efforts were not enough amid the carnage. For example Adolf Urban, Schalke’s star striker who had made his debut for the interntional side in 1935 aged only 21 and was a member of the Breslau Elf, helped his club side to a league triumph in 1942, then played in their cup final defeat to 1860 Munich. It was his last ever game – after the final he was posted to Stalingrad and, like almost 2,000,000 others on both sides, never returned home.International matches had finally ceased in February 1943 on the orders of Joseph Goebbels and his plans for “total war”. Club football ground to a halt in August 1944. In the immediate aftermath of the war, with Germany quartered among the victors, old sporting clubs were banned, and large assemblies of people were outlawed. The ability of footballers to play depended on which zone they found themselves in. Gradually, though, teams reformed or formed anew, with the bigger ones travelling the country taking on smaller sides in exchange for fuel or food. A nascent league system was quickly back in place but it was July 1949 before the German FA, the DFB, came back into being. In February 1950 a West German national side was reformed under the auspices of Herberger, who survived the post-war process of denazificartion despite having been a member of the party since 1933, once more. In September the country was admitted to Fifa and in November West Germany played their first post-war international against Switzerland in Stuttgart. Herberger’s side won 1-0.That result did not exactly herald the birth of a new footballing superpower. Defeats against Turkey and Ireland put Herberger under pressure and they began the qualifying campaign for the 1954 World Cup with a 1-1 draw in Oslo against Norway. The crunch game came in Saarbrucken against the newly independent Saarland and a 3-1 win was enough to take Herberger and his side to the finals.“For the first half of the 20th century, both from a footballing and a political point of view, Hungary had existed in the shadow of Austria,” writes Jonathan Wilson in Inverting the Pyramid. “Their thinking had, inevitably, been influenced by Hugo Meisl and the Danubian Whirl, but the crucial point was that it was thinking. In Budapest, as in Vienna, football was a matter for intellectual debate.”Like Germany, Hungary had been a powerful pre-war footballing presence. They won Olympic gold in 1912 and were beaten finalists at the 1938 World Cup. Like Germany, international football had continued during the second world war until the end of 1943 and in the four years after VE Day, a golden generation emerged.“The Hungarian game has always been built on or round outstanding iniduals,” wrote Willy Meisl in 1956, and by the 1954 World Cup Hungary had an entire team of them. The half-dozen players at the core of the Aranycsapat – the Golden Squad – were all in the side by 1949: Ferenc Puskas and Nandor Hidegkuti made their international bows in 1945, the goalkeeper Gyula Grosics and defender Jozsef Bozsik in 1947, Sandor Kocsis in 1948 and Zoltan Czibor in 1949. Gusztav Sebes, who took sole control of the national side in the same year, had five of that six under his charge at Honved, with only Hidegkuti playing his club football elsewhere.But even with that group in the side, Hungary were by no means on course for World Cup glory. A defeat in Prague against Czechoslovakia in 1949 proved the final straw. “After that game the issue could no longer be avoided,” wrote Puskas in his autobiography. “Hungary had to evolve an entirely new method of play if we were to make any headway in international football.” And that they did, producing a remarkably fluid structure. “Players ... constantly changed position according to a prearranged plan,” wrote Puskas. “The result was that our opponents could not guess our plans and found themselves in difficulties which would not have been experienced had we followed the usual English method of play.”The abandonment of “the usual English method of play” meant Hungary played without the traditional battering ram No9 and instead had first Peter Palotas and, from 1952, Hidegkuti wearing No9 but playing as a trequartista. The results were extraordinary. Between June 1950 and the start of the 1954 World Cup the Mighty Magyars played 30 times without defeat, claiming a second Olympic gold medal in the process. The train that carried the side on the final leg of their journey back to Budapest after glory in Helsinki was stopped at every station by ecstatic crowds and in the capital 400,000 people lined the streets to greet them.And while Germany laboured against Norway and Saarland, Hungary qualified for the 1954 tournament without playing a game, Poland withdrawing from their two-team qualifying group without a ball being kicked.Then on 25 November 1953, Hungary’s Golden Squad visited Wembley to face England. The visitors won 6-3 becoming the first overseas team to win at the national stadium and changing forever English football’s perception of itself. Just for good measure they hammered Walter Winterbottom’s side 7-1 in Budapest in their final warm-up match before the 1954 tournament. Hungary were ready to take on the world. And the world expected to lose.Group Two saw Hungary and West Germany pitted against Turkey (who had qualified for the tournament courtesy of a drawing of lots following a play-off draw against Spain) and a fairly dismal South Korea team who had reached Switzerland by virtue of a win and a draw against Japan in their two-team qualifying group. In typically bonkers Fifa style, odd rules meant that the two seeded teams – Hungary and Turkey (the seedings, again with the rational thinking we’ve come to expect from football’s governing body, having already been set before Turkey’s play-off with Spain) – would not face each other, but play only against the two unseeded sides with the top two sides reaching the knockout stages. If second and third ended level on points would – regardless of goal difference – then play each other in a play-off.Confused? It sounds a muddle, and it was, but Herberger saw the road ahead with clarity. Defeat against Hungary was a certainty, he figured, as was a Turkish victory over the Koreans. His side would, then, need to beat Turkey in their opening game and then again in a play-off if they were to reach the knockout stages.The plan worked perfectly, despite a shaky start. Turkey took a second-minute lead in the Wankdorf Stadium in the opening game but Hans Schäfer equalised and three second-half goals gave Herberger’s side the result they needed. Meanwhile in Zurich, Hungary dispatched the hapless Koreans 9-0, with Kocsis grabbing a hat-trick. “It was more than inexplicable how the Korean team had been admitted,” wrote Puskas. “They were very weak and had had no training.”Turkey would have similarly little trouble and beat South Korea 7-0 in Geneva, while West Germany and Hungary were taking part in one of the most extraordinary and controversial group games in any World Cup. Herberger, with one eye on the play-off and the other, perhaps, on keeping the true strength of his side under wraps, named only four of the side who had played in the opening game. Hungary battered them, Kocsis scoring four in an 8-3 win. But the most significant incident in the game befell Puskas.The inside-left was enjoying himself immensely against the reshuffled German side. “I could feel the ball as a violinist feels his instrument,” he writes. Jupp Posipal could not get near him, so he switched positions with Werner Liebrich. “But even against him I played like a bird on the wing.” Liebrich, though, would finally clip those wings, a crunching tackle (with the score at 5-1) causing a hairline fracture of Puskas’s ankle.Hungary would have to cope without the Galloping Major in their quarter-final against Brazil, but West Germany were still to get there. Back to full strength, though, they had little trouble in their play-off against Turkey – a 7-3 win set up a last-eight tie against Yugoslavia.Hungary reached the semis thanks to a 4-2 win in a bruising encounter with Brazil – “They behaved like violent enemies without respect for our physical safety,” reckoned Puskas from his vantage point in the stands – while Germany squeezed past 1952 Olympic silver medallists Yugoslavia 2-0. In the last four, Hungary, again without Puskas, led the reigning champions Uruguay 2-0 with 15 minutes to go only to be pegged back to 2-2 before winning 4-2 in extra time. There was no such drama for Herberger and his side, a 6-1 thrashing of Austria, who had beaten the host nation 7-5 in the quarters, taking West Germany into the final.For the German captain it would be only the second most important game he had ever played against Hungary. Back in 1945 as Germany collapsed to defeat, Fritz Walter and his airforce base surrendered to the Americans. But they were then handed over to the Russian army and shipped to Siberia, where awaited almost certain death, a journey made by 40,000 German prisoners of war. On the way, Walter’s convoy stopped at a Ukrainian detention centre. The camp police were playing a match. Walter watched from the sidelines, flicked a stray ball back into play and was soon brought into the game. One of the guards recognised him from a friendly Germany had played in Budapest in 1942. The next day Walter’s name was removed from the list of those heading east and he was permitted to return to his home in Kaiserslautern.Nine years later he led his team out for the World Cup final as the rain came down in Bern. The weather, and the boggy pitch, would play into his team’s hands. The German side were wearing a revolutionary new piece of kit – boots with screw-in studs that could be altered depending on the conditions.But those boots were little help in the opening exchanges. After six minutes Liebrich made a certain amount of amends for his tackle in the group game, giving the ball straight to Bozsik 40 yards from goal. He fed Kocsis, whose shot cannoned of a German defender and fell to Puskas who poked the ball home from close range. Two minutes later, Werner Kohlmeyer, under pressure from Kocsis, and his goalkeeper Toni Turek got themselves into an almighty tangle in the box. Czibor scooted away and popped the ball into the empty net – 2-0. Another 8-3 was on the cards.And cue miracle. On 10 minutes Helmut Rahn found space on the left and slung in a low cross. Jozsef Zakarias could only get a toe to the ball and Max Morlock slid the ball home. 2-1. Eight minutes later Fritz Walter slung in a corner, Grosics flapped, and Rahn, thundering in at the back post, slammed in West Germany’s second. 2-2. Hidegkuti hit the post. Kocsis hit the bat. Turek made save after saveAnd finally, with six minutes left, a cross slung into the box was nodded away only as far as Rahn on the edge of the box. He checked on to his left and sent a shot arrowing into the bottom corner. 3-2.While the players were making themselves legends on the pitch, Herbert Zimmerman was doing likewise in the commentary box. His words as Rahn scores the winner are now part of German football folklore. “Tor! Tor! Tor! Tor! Tor fur Deutschland!” And then, unable to take it in: “Drei zu zwei fuhrt Deutschland! Halten Sie mich fur verruckt! Halten Sie mich fur ubergeschnappt!” – “3-2 to Germany. Call me mad! Call me crazy!” There was still time for Puskas to have a goal controversially ruled out for offside and for Czibor to be denied brilliantly by Turek. But Hungary could not find an equaliser. It was over. Or, as Zimmerman put it: “Aus! Aus! Aus! Aus! Das spiel ist aus!” West Germany were world champions.The Miracle of Bern is a Sliding Doors moment. Budapest went into uproar, with demonstrations in the streets. In 1952 the Golden Squad had returned to a 400,000-strong party. In 1954 they waited for days in the town of Tata until the worst of the trouble had ended in the capital. There are those who feel that the seeds of the 1956 revolution were sown in those days after the final. As far as football was concerned,Hungary at first continued where they had left off in the semi-final, going another 18 matches unbeaten to take their record to one defeat in 49 games between June 1950 and November 1955. But the run petered out and Sebes was replaced early in 1956, his team and the coaching structures around it dismantled. The heights of the early 50s would never again be reached. Of the Miracle of Bern Tibor Nyilasi, who played up front for the national side in the late 70s and early 80s, told Jonathan Wilson in his book Beyond the Curtain: “It is as though Hungarian football is frozen at that moment, as though we have never quite moved on from then.”While the Hungarians hung out in Tata, the German side had their own train troubles. The locomotive bringing Walter, Herberger and the Jules Rimet Trophy back to West Germany was stopped time and time again, not by leaves on the line or the wrong kind of snow, but by fans pouring out of their houses and on to the tracks in order to get a glimpse of the world champions and show their gratitude.Not just the football team but the country moved from strength to strength. Academic studies have been written on the effect of the victory in 1954 on the collective German psyche. The writer Friedrich Christian Delius felt “a guilt-ridden, inhibited nation was suddenly reborn”. National pride, absent from the country after the horrors of 1933-45, could begin to return in some form. “Suddenly Germany was somebody again,” said Franz Beckenbauer. “For anybody who grew up in the misery of the post-war years, Bern was an extraordinary inspiration. The entire country regained its self-esteem.” West Germany had existed as an entity since 1949, but the historian Joachim Fest reckoned the day of the game marked the “true birth of the country”.“Gerd Müller’s winner against Holland in 1974 is basically just a goal, as is Andreas Brehme’s penalty against Argentina in 1990,” writes Uli Hesse in Tor! “But Rahn’s left-footed shot on that rainy summer day in Switzerland is something else entirely.”This piece is hugley indebted to Uli Hesse’s superlative Tor! The Story of German Football.

Or perhaps only a little in doubt in those moments when Roma pressed and suddenly Liverpool’s defence began to look alarmingly zany, pockets of space opening up as though subject to a sudden buckling of the earth’s crust.Certainly the Champions League has never known anything like this. A 4-2 victory for Roma brought to an end a double-header that has seen 20 goals scored in two semi-finals, capped by a pair of hysterically open second legs. Defending is over. Clean sheets are over. Pour it on, let it burn. Elite club football has never looked quite so drunk on space, intoxicated by the urge to play only in forward gear.Not that any of this will take the gloss from a wonderful moment of triumph both for Liverpool and indeed for the Premier League, which has missed this stage. At the end of a sweaty, boisterous, agreeably open night in Rome that long march to the final continues. From Hoffenheim in August, through Spain, Russia, Slovenia, Portugal, Manchester and Italy. And followed now by the trek east to Kiev and the Soviet-scale stage of another, even more oppressively huge, Olympic Stadium.Before kick-off Rome was its usual beautiful, muggy, flaneurial self, despite the large police presence on the streets. On the bridges across the Tiber, Roma fans lounged carelessly, with the Stadio Olimpico a surprisingly green and fragrant kind of place, even on a day of high alert.Jürgen Klopp was faced with a teaser. To stick or twist: to hang on to the 5-2 riches of the first leg or to seek a little more, knowing that under pressure Liverpool’s defensive line is likely to offer up those same spaces “as big as the Mersey” he would talk about at his press conference two hours later.This is the question Liverpool now face, a quandary that will hang over their prep for Kiev in three weeks’ time. Real Madrid press with a murderous intent through those channels where Liverpool are weak, ganging up in the full-back areas, punishing every moment of hesitation. Klopp’s team have just conceded six goals to a moderate Roma. They are going to need a bigger boat.In particular Klopp will puzzle over the full-back positions. Trent Alexander-Arnold had a difficult game in Rome, something that will have been noted by those ruthless white-shirted opponents to come. Madrid score a huge number of goals from crosses. Quite what Kiev might bring if the right flank is left this open once again is a hair-raising question given the ruthlessness of Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo on that side.“Incubo Rosso” was the headline in the Corriere dello Sport, a reference to Roma’s evisceration in the first leg, but also an imprecation to their own team to create something similar inside this beautiful, open, flying saucer of a stadium.And in those opening moments Roma did press hard, looking to play diagonal balls in behind Alexander-Arnold, who scurried and hustled and just about hung in there. He was lucky not to give away a penalty for handball later. His passing went awry. It was a little painful at times. But Klopp kept him out there until the dying moments and after the final whistle it was Alexander -Arnold, the local kid, so full of life when he presses forward, who led the Liverpool huddle across the advertising boards and into a delirious moment of communion with the travelling fans.There is more, at times, to being part of a team. But this is rarefied air and Klopp will have a few weeks now to ponder how to close those spaces, to minimise the damage that will inevitably come.On the other flank Andy Robertson was his usual fine, physically relentless self. The moment that effectively killed the tie after 25 minutes was largely his work. With the score 1-1 Robertson sprinted out wide to keep the ball in by the touchline and then drove on, skating in thrilling fashion outside Alessandro Florenzi, a wonderful moment of adventure and brio. From the ensuing corner Georginio Wijnaldum headed in.Earlier Sadio Mané, man of the match on the night, had given the visitors the lead from another of those familiar breaks, three or four Liverpool players sprinting together, chest to chest, like an early heat in the men’s 60-metres dash. This time they were helped by Radja Nainggolan giving the ball straight to Roberto Firmino 40 yards from goal. Don’t do that. Don’t give the ball to Roberto Firmino 40 yards from goal. We know how this ends by now.After which Liverpool hung on, with enough in the tank to still take a tie they lost 6-2 over the final 110 minutes. But then for this team there is only one way: that of power chords and face-melting solos.Liverpool could choose to blink now, to seek that middle ground of damage-limitation. Or they could simply lock the wheel and go careering out over the edge of the cliff, silk scarves fluttering. In the year of breathless attack it would be a fitting moment to keep on driving, eyes fixed in front, towards a final that promises more space, more spills, and a shared surge to the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb8b35c16dbf33b9a0c94b5c821ce9c4a101f6ba/0_141_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4c90ffc3075d58ec2313001211a49c","title":"mercedes sieffs recipe for super spring green salad","story":"This seasonal, nutritional powerhouse is perfect for when you need a boost of energy, with a delicious tahini-based dressingThis salad is my go-to dish whenever I need a boost of energy and green goodness.

What lies behind Kanye West’s recent provocations?Photograph: Smallz \u0026amp RaskindContour by Getty ImageIn a video viewed more than 6m times on Twitter, 21-year-old Chika Oranika summed up the current feelings of many black Americans about Kanye West. She delivered her own lyrics over the beat of the rap star’s Jesus Walks. “How you say you Yeezus but do nothing to restore us? You support the people up in power that abort us,” she raps into the camera. “It don’t matter how much money you got or you lack, when that cheque clear don’t forget that your children are still black.”Why the opprobrium, which has come from activists, Hollywood stars and fellow musicians, as well as withering online freestyles? West, one of the most significant, complex and celebrated rappers in the US, has used a 350-tweet stream of consciousness over the past fornight to throw his support firmly behind Donald Trump. But yesterday, he went way beyond party politics in an interview with TMZ, saying, in a sloppy bit of rhetoric: “You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.”Host Van Lathan tore back at him: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Roxane Gay reacted on Twitter by calling his comments “dangerous” and “trite, shallow … he is not a free thinker. He is a free moron.”In response, R\u0026ampB singer Frank Ocean emerged from hibernation with a sarcastic screengrab of the time West went off-script during a 2005 Hurricane Katrina appeal to say “George Bush doesn’t care about black people”, the intimation being that it is now West who doesn’t care. Samuel L Jackson suggested West was courting an audience in “the sunken place” – the psychic interzone in the horror film Get Out into which black people are hypnotised and silenced (the film’s director, Jordan Peele, has previously linked it to Trump’s America).“So many people who love you feel so betrayed right know because they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of colour,” West’s friend John Legend wrote in a text message that West posted on Twitter. The rap star wrote back: “You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.” Among ordinary Americans, meanwhile, there was seething anger at West supporting someone who has said “laziness is a trait in blacks” who campaigned for the death penalty for the black teenagers, later proven innocent, in the Central Park Five case and who thought there were some “very fine people” marching alongside neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.Reacting to – or having perhaps anticipated – all this, West released a new track, Ye Vs the People, the first music from two new albums being released in June. In a dialogue with the American people (vocalised by rapper T.I.), Kanye tries to detoxify the Trump brand and reclaim his Make America Great Again slogan: “Wearin’ the hat’ll show people that we equal,” he raps, arguing for a why-can’t-we-all-just-get-along humanism. He ultimately distils the debate thus: “You on some choosin’ side shit, I’m on some unified shit.”For Kanye, this chapter is just the latest incident in an uncompromising career. At the turn of the century, as a beatmaker for Jay-Z and others, he really did seem to be on “some unified shit”, taking the chopped-up soul samples of “backpack” hip-hop and pairing them with the blockbuster tropes of mainstream rap production he then successfully segued into being a unified producer-rapper. His first two albums charmed the whole spectrum of rap fans with their ersity and humour: he riffed on black cultural reference points – slow-jam love songs, social climbers – like a standup comedian.His albums became more ambitious with each new release, unifying erse cultural reference points – Graduation sampled Daft Punk and explored a more electronic sound 808s \u0026amp Heartbreak used Auto-Tune to reflect and enact emotional dissonance, to brilliant effect My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was as operatic as the title suggests. His interest in visual art grew, with artists from Takashi Murakami to George Condo commissioned for his album covers he designed his own fashion collections and collaborated with Adidas. In 2013, he said: “Creative genius, that’s my title. My title is not rapper any more.” West positioned himself as a rounded aesthete, obsessed with form and how art impacts society – his Twitter feed has recently featured everything from tech solutions for water desalination to artists Joseph Beuys and David Hammons. Part of his attraction to Kardashian seemed to be her very iconography: “My girl a superstar all from a home movie”, he wondered admiringly on 2012 track Clique.He also continued his analysis of black America. On the same track he raps: “You know white people get money, don’t spend it  Or maybe they get money, buy a business  I’d rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant.” West sees himself as celebrating the economic freedom black Americans were denied for decades, and to which they still have much less access than whites. It’s an extension of a key Jay-Z line – “I do this for my culture, to let ’em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roadster” – from Izzo (HOVA), a track that Kanye produced.And since Yeezus, his self-obsession has become stifling. His 2016 album The Life of Pablo has a great skit called I Love Kanye, where he imagines: “What if Kanye made a song about Kanye called I Miss the Old Kanye? Man, that’d be so Kanye!”In the wake of his slavery comments, the skit stops being funny: black people really do miss the old, outward-looking Kanye. Rapper Meek Mill summed up the thoughts of many when he posted an image of Kanye to Instagram yesterday, surrounded by the words “RIP Old Kanye” and quoting Kanye’s lyrics back at him: “I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny  And what I do? Act more stupidly.”The problem is that Kanye’s self-scrutiny has become so advanced that he is beginning to see the world purely through the prism of Kanye, rather than the eyes of black America. That’s harmful not just to himself, but to an ongoing civil rights struggle in a still-racist US his provocations have the potential to embolden the alt-right and others who would diminish the standing of African Americans.Like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, both figures he admires, it’s hard to place Kanye on to a left-right political binary. His personal political philosophy doesn’t neatly dovetail with existing belief systems – witness how the alt-right embraced him after his championing of Trump, and then deserted him when he also championed Parkland shooting survivor and activist Emma Gonzalez last weekend.Any analysis is complicated by West’s hospitalisation for two weeks in 2016 after a mental breakdown, following intense touring and an incident where Kardashian was robbed in Paris. He has recast the episode as a “breakthrough” and says he is using medication that “helps calm me down” Kardashian has expressed frustration at how Kanye is framed as mentally ill when he is “just being himself when he has always been expressive”. And of course, there is a long history of black people being dismissed as crazy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6fe0a1fb904128707926198d5fcc8b23e407c6/601_0_4131_2479/master/4131.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f86aaa0a570cd21c776d4b6dd9974d9","title":"why silicon valley cant fix itself tech humanism","story":"Tech insiders have finally started admitting their mistakes – but the solutions they are offering could just help the big players get even more powerful. By  Ben Tarnoff and  Moira WeigelBig Tech is sorry. After decades of rarely apologising for anything, Silicon Valley suddenly seems to be apologising for everything. They are sorry about the trolls. They are sorry about the bots. They are sorry about the fake news and the Russians, and the cartoons that are terrifying your kids on YouTube. But they are especially sorry about our brains.Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook – who was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network – has publicly lamented the “unintended consequences” of the platform he helped create: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Justin Rosenstein, an engineer who helped build Facebook’s “like” button and Gchat, regrets having contributed to technology that he now considers psychologically damaging, too. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”Ever since the internet became widely used by the public in the 1990s, users have heard warnings that it is bad for us. In the early years, many commentators described cyberspace as a parallel universe that could swallow enthusiasts whole. The media fretted about kids talking to strangers and finding porn. A prominent 1998 study from Carnegie Mellon University claimed that spending time online made you lonely, depressed and antisocial.In the mid-2000s, as the internet moved on to mobile devices, physical and virtual life began to merge. Bullish pundits celebrated the “cognitive surplus” unlocked by crowdsourcing and the tech-savvy campaigns of Barack Obama, the “internet president”. But, alongside these optimistic voices, darker warnings persisted. Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows (2010) argued that search engines were making people stupid, while Eli Pariser’s The Filter Bubble (2011) claimed algorithms made us insular by showing us only what we wanted to see. In Alone, Together (2011) and Reclaiming Conversation (2015), Sherry Turkle warned that constant connectivity was making meaningful interaction impossible.Still, inside the industry, techno-utopianism prevailed. Silicon Valley seemed to assume that the tools they were building were always forces for good – and that anyone who questioned them was a crank or a luddite. In the face of an anti-tech backlash that has surged since the 2016 election, however, this faith appears to be faltering. Prominent people in the industry are beginning to acknowledge that their products may have harmful effects.Internet anxiety isn’t new. But never before have so many notable figures within the industry seemed so anxious about the world they have made. Parker, Rosenstein and the other insiders now talking about the harms of smartphones and social media belong to an informal yet influential current of tech critics emerging within Silicon Valley. You could call them the “tech humanists”. Amid rising public concern about the power of the industry, they argue that the primary problem with its products is that they threaten our health and our humanity.It is clear that these products are designed to be maximally addictive, in order to harvest as much of our attention as they can. Tech humanists say this business model is both unhealthy and inhumane – that it damages our psychological well-being and conditions us to behave in ways that diminish our humanity. The main solution that they propose is better design. By redesigning technology to be less addictive and less manipulative, they believe we can make it healthier – we can realign technology with our humanity and build products that don’t “hijack” our minds.The hub of the new tech humanism is the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco. Founded earlier this year, the nonprofit has assembled an impressive roster of advisers, including investor Roger McNamee, Lyft president John Zimmer, and Rosenstein. But its most prominent spokesman is executive director Tristan Harris, a former “design ethicist” at Google who has been hailed by the Atlantic magazine as “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”. Harris has spent years trying to persuade the industry of the dangers of tech addiction. In February, Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, launched a related initiative: the Tech and Society Solutions Lab, which aims to “maximise the tech industry’s contributions to a healthy society”.As suspicion of Silicon Valley grows, the tech humanists are making a bid to become tech’s loyal opposition. They are using their insider credentials to promote a particular diagnosis of where tech went wrong and of how to get it back on track. For this, they have been getting a lot of attention. As the backlash against tech has grown, so too has the appeal of techies repenting for their sins. The Center for Humane Technology has been profiled – and praised by – the New York Times, the Atlantic, Wired and others.But tech humanism’s influence cannot be measured solely by the positive media coverage it has received. The real reason tech humanism matters is because some of the most powerful people in the industry are starting to speak its idiom. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has warned about social media’s role in encouraging “mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions”, and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey recently claimed he wants to improve the platform’s “conversational health”.Even Mark Zuckerberg, famous for encouraging his engineers to “move fast and break things”, seems to be taking a tech humanist turn. In January, he announced that Facebook had a new priority: maximising “time well spent” on the platform, rather than total time spent. By “time well spent”, Zuckerberg means time spent interacting with “friends” rather than businesses, brands or media sources. He said the News Feed algorithm was already prioritising these “more meaningful” activities.Zuckerberg’s choice of words is significant: Time Well Spent is the name of the advocacy group that Harris led before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology. In April, Zuckerberg brought the phrase to Capitol Hill. When a photographer snapped a picture of the notes Zuckerberg used while testifying before the Senate, they included a discussion of Facebook’s new emphasis on “time well spent”, under the heading “wellbeing”.This new concern for “wellbeing” may strike some observers as a welcome development. After years of ignoring their critics, industry leaders are finally acknowledging that problems exist. Tech humanists deserve credit for drawing attention to one of those problems – the manipulative design decisions made by Silicon Valley.But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete – and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform. Taken up by leaders such as Zuckerberg, tech humanism is likely to result in only superficial changes. These changes may soothe some of the popular anger directed towards the tech industry, but they will not address the origin of that anger. If anything, they will make Silicon Valley even more powerful.The Center for Humane Technology argues that technology must be “aligned” with humanity – and that the best way to accomplish this is through better design. Their website features a section entitled The Way Forward. A familiar evolutionary image shows the silhouettes of several simians, rising from their crouches to become a man, who then turns back to contemplate his history.“In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design,” the header reads. To the litany of problems caused by “technology that extracts attention and erodes society”, the text asserts that “humane design is the solution”. Drawing on the rhetoric of the “design thinking” philosophy that has long suffused Silicon Valley, the website explains that humane design “starts by understanding our most vulnerable human instincts so we can design compassionately”.There is a good reason why the language of tech humanism is penetrating the upper echelons of the tech industry so easily: this language is not foreign to Silicon Valley. On the contrary, “humanising” technology has long been its central ambition and the source of its power. It was precisely by developing a “humanised” form of computing that entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs brought computing into millions of users’ everyday lives. Their success turned the Bay Area tech industry into a global powerhouse – and produced the digitised world that today’s tech humanists now lament.The story begins in the 1960s, when Silicon Valley was still a handful of electronics firms clustered among fruit orchards. Computers came in the form of mainframes then. These machines were big, expensive and difficult to use. Only corporations, universities and government agencies could afford them, and they were reserved for specialised tasks, such as calculating missile trajectories or credit scores.Computing was industrial, in other words, not personal, and Silicon Valley remained dependent on a small number of big institutional clients. The practical danger that this dependency posed became clear in the early 1960s, when the US Department of Defense, by far the single biggest buyer of digital components, began cutting back on its purchases. But the fall in military procurement wasn’t the only mid-century crisis around computing.Computers also had an image problem. The inaccessibility of mainframes made them easy to demonise. In these whirring hulks of digital machinery, many observers saw something inhuman, even evil. To antiwar activists, computers were weapons of the war machine that was killing thousands in Vietnam. To highbrow commentators such as the social critic Lewis Mumford, computers were instruments of a creeping technocracy that threatened to extinguish personal freedom.But during the course of the 1960s and 70s, a series of experiments in northern California helped solve both problems. These experiments yielded breakthrough innovations like the graphical user interface, the mouse and the microprocessor. Computers became smaller, more usable and more interactive, reducing Silicon Valley’s reliance on a few large customers while giving digital technology a friendlier face.The pioneers who led this transformation believed they were making computing more human. They drew deeply from the counterculture of the period, and its fixation on developing “human” modes of living. They wanted their machines to be “extensions of man”, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, and to unlock “human potential” rather than repress it. At the centre of this ecosystem of hobbyists, hackers, hippies and professional engineers was Stewart Brand, famed entrepreneur of the counterculture and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. In a famous 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand called for a new model of computing that “served human interest, not machine”.Brand’s disciples answered this call by developing the technical innovations that transformed computers into the form we recognise today. They also promoted a new way of thinking about computers – not as impersonal slabs of machinery, but as tools for unleashing “human potential”.No single figure contributed more to this transformation of computing than Steve Jobs, who was a fan of Brand and a reader of the Whole Earth Catalog. Jobs fulfilled Brand’s vision on a global scale, launching the mass personal computing era with the Macintosh in the mid-80s, and the mass smartphone era with the iPhone two decades later. Brand later acknowledged that Jobs embodied the Whole Earth Catalog ethos. “He got the notion of tools for human use,” Brand told Jobs’ biographer, Walter Isaacson.Building those “tools for human use” turned out to be great for business. The impulse to humanise computing enabled Silicon Valley to enter every crevice of our lives. From phones to tablets to laptops, we are surrounded by devices that have fulfilled the demands of the counterculture for digital connectivity, interactivity and self-expression. Your iPhone responds to the slightest touch you can look at photos of anyone you have ever known, and broadcast anything you want to all of them, at any moment.In short, the effort to humanise computing produced the very situation that the tech humanists now consider dehumanising: a wilderness of screens where digital devices chase every last instant of our attention. To guide us out of that wilderness, tech humanists say we need more humanising. They believe we can use better design to make technology serve human nature rather than exploit and corrupt it. But this idea is drawn from the same tradition that created the world that tech humanists believe is distracting and damaging us.Tech humanists say they want to align humanity and technology. But this project is based on a deep misunderstanding of the relationship between humanity and technology: namely, the fantasy that these two entities could ever exist in separation.It is difficult to imagine human beings without technology. The story of our species began when we began to make tools. Homo habilis, the first members of our genus, left sharpened stones scattered across Africa. Their successors hit rocks against each other to make sparks, and thus fire. With fire you could cook meat and clear land for planting with ash you could fertilise the soil with smoke you could make signals. In flickering light, our ancestors painted animals on cave walls. The ancient tragedian Aeschylus recalled this era mythically: Prometheus, in stealing fire from the gods, “founded all the arts of men.”All of which is to say: humanity and technology are not only entangled, they constantly change together. This is not just a metaphor. Recent research suggests that the human hand evolved to manipulate the stone tools that our ancestors used. The evolutionary scientist Mary Marzke shows that we developed “a unique pattern of muscle architecture and joint surface form and functions” for this purpose.The ways our bodies and brains change in conjunction with the tools we make have long inspired anxieties that “we” are losing some essential qualities. For millennia, people have feared that new media were eroding the very powers that they promised to extend. In The Phaedrus, Socrates warned that writing on wax tablets would make people forgetful. If you could jot something down, you wouldn’t have to remember it. In the late middle ages, as a culture of copying manuscripts gave way to printed books, teachers warned that pupils would become careless, since they no longer had to transcribe what their teachers said.Yet as we lose certain capacities, we gain new ones. People who used to navigate the seas by following stars can now program computers to steer container ships from afar. Your grandmother probably has better handwriting than you do – but you probably type faster.The nature of human nature is that it changes. It can not, therefore, serve as a stable basis for evaluating the impact of technology. Yet the assumption that it doesn’t change serves a useful purpose. Treating human nature as something static, pure and essential elevates the speaker into a position of power. Claiming to tell us who we are, they tell us how we should be.Intentionally or not, this is what tech humanists are doing when they talk about technology as threatening human nature – as if human nature had stayed the same from the paleolithic era until the rollout of the iPhone. Holding humanity and technology separate clears the way for a small group of humans to determine the proper alignment between them. And while the tech humanists may believe they are acting in the common good, they themselves acknowledge they are doing so from above, as elites. “We have a moral responsibility to steer people’s thoughts ethically,” Tristan Harris has declared.Harris and his fellow tech humanists also frequently invoke the language of public health. The Center for Humane Technology’s Roger McNamee has gone so far as to call public health “the root of the whole thing”, and Harris has compared using Snapchat to smoking cigarettes. The public-health framing casts the tech humanists in a paternalistic role. Resolving a public health crisis requires public health expertise. It also precludes the possibility of democratic debate. You don’t put the question of how to treat a disease up for a vote – you call a doctor.This paternalism produces a central irony of tech humanism: the language that they use to describe users is often dehumanising. “Facebook appeals to your lizard brain – primarily fear and anger,” says McNamee. Harris echoes this sentiment: “Imagine you had an input cable,” he has said. “You’re trying to jack it into a human being. Do you want to jack it into their reptilian brain, or do you want to jack it into their more reflective self?”The Center for Humane Technology’s website offers tips on how to build a more reflective and less reptilian relationship to your smartphone: “going greyscale” by setting your screen to black-and-white, turning off app notifications and charging your device outside your bedroom. It has also announced two major initiatives: a national campaign to raise awareness about technology’s harmful effects on young people’s “digital health and well-being” and a “Ledger of Harms” – a website that will compile information about the health effects of different technologies in order to guide engineers in building “healthier” products.These initiatives may help some people reduce their smartphone use – a reasonable personal goal. But there are some humans who may not share this goal, and there need not be anything unhealthy about that. Many people rely on the internet for solace and solidarity, especially those who feel marginalised. The kid with autism may stare at his screen when surrounded by people, because it lets him tolerate being surrounded by people. For him, constant use of technology may not be destructive at all, but in fact life-saving.Pathologising certain potentially beneficial behaviours as “sick” isn’t the only problem with the Center for Humane Technology’s proposals. They also remain confined to the personal level, aiming to redesign how the inidual user interacts with technology rather than tackling the industry’s structural failures. Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it.This may be why their approach is so appealing to the tech industry. There is no reason to doubt the good intentions of tech humanists, who may genuinely want to address the problems fuelling the tech backlash. But they are handing the firms that caused those problems a valuable weapon. Far from challenging Silicon Valley, tech humanism offers Silicon Valley a useful way to pacify public concerns without surrendering any of its enormous wealth and power. By channelling popular anger at Big Tech into concerns about health and humanity, tech humanism gives corporate giants such as Facebook a way to avoid real democratic control. In a moment of danger, it may even help them protect their profits.One can easily imagine a version of Facebook that embraces the principles of tech humanism while remaining a profitable and powerful monopoly. In fact, these principles could make Facebook even more profitable and powerful, by opening up new business opportunities. That seems to be exactly what Facebook has planned.Zuckerberg said he expected those changes would continue to decrease total time spent – but “the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable”. This may describe what users find valuable – but it also refers to what Facebook finds valuable. In a recent interview, he said: “Over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that’s going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.”Sheryl Sandberg has also stressed that the shift will create “more monetisation opportunities”. How? Everyone knows data is the lifeblood of Facebook – but not all data is created equal. One of the most valuable sources of data to Facebook is used to inform a metric called “coefficient”. This measures the strength of a connection between two users – Zuckerberg once called it “an index for each relationship”. Facebook records every interaction you have with another user – from liking a friend’s post or viewing their profile, to sending them a message. These activities provide Facebook with a sense of how close you are to another person, and different activities are weighted differently. Messaging, for instance, is considered the strongest signal. It’s reasonable to assume that you’re closer to somebody you exchange messages with than somebody whose post you once liked.Why is coefficient so valuable? Because Facebook uses it to create a Facebook they think you will like: it guides algorithmic decisions about what content you see and the order in which you see it. It also helps improve ad targeting, by showing you ads for things liked by friends with whom you often interact. Advertisers can target the closest friends of the users who already like a product, on the assumption that close friends tend to like the same things.So when Zuckerberg talks about wanting to increase “meaningful” interactions and building relationships, he is not succumbing to pressure to take better care of his users. Rather, emphasising time well spent means creating a Facebook that prioritises data-rich personal interactions that Facebook can use to make a more engaging platform. Rather than spending a lot of time doing things that Facebook doesn’t find valuable – such as watching viral videos – you can spend a bit less time, but spend it doing things that Facebook does find valuable.In other words, “time well spent” means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction – it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook’s current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can’t keep prioritising total time spent – it has to extract more value from less time.In many ways, this process recalls an earlier stage in the evolution of capitalism. In the 19th century, factory owners in England discovered they could only make so much money by extending the length of the working day. At some point, workers would die of exhaustion, or they would revolt, or they would push parliament to pass laws that limited their working hours. So industrialists had to find ways to make the time of the worker more valuable – to extract more money from each moment rather than adding more moments. They did this by making industrial production more efficient: developing new technologies and techniques that squeezed more value out of the worker and stretched that value further than ever before.A similar situation confronts Facebook today. They have to make the attention of the user more valuable – and the language and concepts of tech humanism can help them do it. So far, it seems to be working. Despite the reported drop in total time spent, Facebook recently announced huge 2018 Q1 earnings of $11.97bn (£8.7bn), smashing Wall Street estimates by nearly $600m.Today’s tech humanists come from a tradition with deep roots in Silicon Valley. Like their predecessors, they believe that technology and humanity are distinct, but can be harmonised. This belief guided the generations who built the “humanised” machines that became the basis for the industry’s enormous power. Today it may provide Silicon Valley with a way to protect that power from a growing public backlash – and even deepen it by uncovering new opportunities for profit-making.Fortunately, there is another way of thinking about how to live with technology – one that is both truer to the history of our species and useful for building a more democratic future. This tradition does not address “humanity” in the abstract, but as distinct human beings, whose capacities are shaped by the tools they use. It sees us as hybrids of animal and machine – as “cyborgs”, to quote the biologist and philosopher of science Donna Haraway.To say that we’re all cyborgs is not to say that all technologies are good for us, or that we should embrace every new invention. But it does suggest that living well with technology can’t be a matter of making technology more “human”. This goal isn’t just impossible – it’s also dangerous, because it puts us at the mercy of experts who tell us how to be human. It cedes control of our technological future to those who believe they know what’s best for us because they understand the essential truths about our species.The cyborg way of thinking, by contrast, tells us that our species is essentially technological. We change as we change our tools, and our tools change us. But even though our continuous co-evolution with our machines is inevitable, the way it unfolds is not. Rather, it is determined by who owns and runs those machines. It is a question of power.Today, that power is wielded by corporations, which own our technology and run it for profit. The various scandals that have stoked the tech backlash all share a single source. Surveillance, fake news and the miserable working conditions in Amazon’s warehouses are profitable. If they were not, they would not exist. They are symptoms of a profound democratic deficit inflicted by a system that prioritises the wealth of the few over the needs and desires of the many.There is an alternative. If being technological is a feature of being human, then the power to shape how we live with technology should be a fundamental human right. The decisions that most affect our technological lives are far too important to be left to Mark Zuckerberg, rich investors or a handful of “humane designers”. They should be made by everyone, together.Rather than trying to humanise technology, then, we should be trying to democratise it. We should be demanding that society as a whole gets to decide how we live with technology – rather than the small group of people who have captured society’s wealth.What does this mean in practice? First, it requires limiting and eroding Silicon Valley’s power. Antitrust laws and tax policy offer useful ways to claw back the fortunes Big Tech has built on common resources. After all, Silicon Valley wouldn’t exist without billions of dollars of public funding, not to mention the vast quantities of information that we all provide for free. Facebook’s market capitalisation is $500bn with 2.2 billion users – do the math to estimate how much the time you spend on Facebook is worth. You could apply the same logic to Google. There is no escape: whether or not you have an account, both platforms track you around the internet.In addition to taxing and shrinking tech firms, democratic governments should be making rules about how those firms are allowed to behave – rules that restrict how they can collect and use our personal data, for instance, like the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in the European Union later this month. But more robust regulation of Silicon Valley isn’t enough. We also need to pry the ownership of our digital infrastructure away from private firms.This means developing publicly and co-operatively owned alternatives that empower workers, users and citizens to determine how they are run. These democratic digital structures can focus on serving personal and social needs rather than piling up profits for investors. One inspiring example is municipal broadband: a successful experiment in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown that publicly owned internet service providers can supply better service at lower cost than private firms. Other models of digital democracy might include a worker-owned Uber, a user-owned Facebook or a socially owned “smart city” of the kind being developed in Barcelona. Alternatively, we might demand that tech firms pay for the privilege of extracting our data, so that we can collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create.More experimentation is needed, but democracy should be our guiding principle. The stakes are high. Never before have so many people been thinking about the problems produced by the tech industry and how to solve them. The tech backlash is an enormous opportunity – and one that may not come again for a long time.The old techno-utopianism is crumbling. What will replace it? Silicon Valley says it wants to make the world a better place. Fulfilling this promise may require a new kind of disruption.Main illustration by Lee Martin Design• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f38b9096a38ad66bb1cdba1033bf7b39365df/0_0_3500_2377/master/3500.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=576c7028c4c8ab336e8ba3da7e90c8f1","title":"local elections havering brexit stronghold immigration less of an issue now","story":"Local election Labour candidates say crime and housing have moved up the list of concernsLast summer a row erupted over Havering council’s plan to split from the rest of London. The motion, tabled by a Ukip councillor and dubbed “Hexit”, was an attempt to solve the east London borough’s so-called “identity crisis”.“It was laughed out of the chamber,” says Fay Hough, the 30-year-old Labour candidate for the Rainham \u0026amp Wennington ward in the upcoming local elections, “because there were no positives. We would have lost funding, the London living wage, even the Freedom pass.”The vote, Hough adds, was part of a trend in which Labour’s opposition has billed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a figure of dislike from whom they want a orce. A recent Tory campaign to “Keep Havering Safe”, for example, was accused of “dog-whistle racism” after leaflets were distributed warning that the borough could soon resemble erse “inner city” areas under Khan.“I think there are local politicians who are playing on people’s fear of difference,” says Kim Arrowsmith, another Labour candidate.“The demographic of the area is changing, and over time that will make that kind of politics very difficult to sell. The fear will dissipate.”Immigration, the candidates say, is less of an issue now, with housing and crime coming up most often on the doorstep. “We’ve got a bidding system for council housing which is seen as not-fit-for-purpose,” says Arrowsmith. “And a lot of privately rented places aren’t accepting benefits any more. What I find comes up a lot is single mums who can’t work full-time but can’t rent a place.”“And I’ve had a few people who say ‘my 28-year-old daughter’s still living with me at home, there’s no way she can afford to move in on her own’,” says Hough, who has been volunteering for local MP Jon Cruddas’s office for two years.Havering is no stranger to regeneration, and estates are being knocked down to make way for new developments. But Labour say there are no assurances of right to return. The borough is also the site of Orchard Village, a housing development so plagued with issues related to building quality that it has faced calls for demolition.On the streets of Rainham, which the candidates call “the forgotten part of Havering”, most of the people who open the door are friendly and responsive.“Crime often comes up,” says Nicholas West, a 23-year-old prospective Labour councillor. “The anxiety last summer was so extreme because of moped robberies. Knife crime has been an issue too. When I was growing up I had youth centres to go to, now there’s nothing for the kids. Over the Easter holidays the kids are just on the street bored. And that’s when they’re most vulnerable to being taken in by gangs.”A police station in the area had to recently shut because of cuts, West adds. All this plays into the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s strategy of putting housing and crime at the heart of his party’s bid to take over Tory local authorities. Such national politics can work for and against the local candidates on the doorstep, Arrowsmith says. “People sometimes say ‘you’re all the same’. National politics helped with that, because no one can say Labour and the Tories are the same any more. We’re seeing a much more positive picture because voters are ready for change. Jeremy represents a break from the past. The Tories really targeted Dagenham and Rainham in the general election but Jon Cruddas’ majority went up.”As we’re walking through Rainham, one woman stops us in the street. “Just so you know I’ll be voting Labour,” she says. “I’m a new member.

Before he was appointed home secretary, he waded into the row about whether the UK should remain in a customs union, tweeting, “British people gave politicians clear instructions through EU referendum. Includes leaving the Customs Union, an intrinsic part of the EU.”The hard-Brexiters prefer an alternative, maximum facilitation, or “max fac”, proposal, which relies on technology to keep border-checks to a minimum, and Javid gave them his backing at the meeting on Wednesday, regarding this plan as more practical.Brussels has expressed reservations about both proposals, and dismissed the government’s approach to resolving the Irish border problem as “magical thinking”. Talks on Britain’s future relationship with the EU27 are essentially deadlocked, as Brussels awaits a steer from the government about which plan it wants to pursue.Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “We are 331 days until UK becomes a third country under EU law, and the government can’t decide between two options already rejected by the other side of the negotiation. It is farcical. The Brexit war cabinet is more like a warring cabinet that is split completely down the middle. They have no plan and no clue.” understands neither of the two options will go forward in their present format to the meeting of the whole cabinet next week.Instead, No 10 is expected to do some more detailed work on both options and recall the Brexit subcommittee in a few days’ time, raising the prospect that May could return with an amended “hybrid plus” model, that could be more acceptable.“They’re both serious proposals, and they both pose a different set of challenges, which need to be addressed,” a Downing Street source said.While no vote was taken, Brexit sources claimed the balance of the meeting was 6-5 against a customs partnership, with defence secretary Gavin Williamson also “leaning away” from it.The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, spoke critically of the customs partnership, but was not vocal in favour of the max-fac option either, one source said. “He wasn’t leading the charge against it, but both he and Sajid made clear that they had significant reservations about the partnership option.” Hard-Brexit sources added that May appeared “genuinely surprised” at the “robust” interventions from colleagues sceptical about the partnership approach.However, proponents of a soft Brexit countered that with chief whip Julian Smith present, there were 12 people in the room – although Smith is understood not to have made his stance clear.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, and his allies fear the “max fac” approach would not meet the government’s pledge of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.Peers inflicted a fresh defeat on the government in the House of Lords over the Irish border issue on Wednesday evening, backing a cross-party amendment supported by former Tory minister Chris Patten.The amendment would commit the government to avoiding any Brexit deal that would jeopardise the Good Friday agreement, and passed by 309 to 242, a majority of 67 and the latest of a series of hefty losses on the withdrawal bill.When the legislation comes back to the Commons, the government is likely to urge MPs to vote to reject this and a series of other amendments, including one aimed at forcing them to pursue a customs union.May has delayed a series of contentious votes, including on the customs and trade bills, to which backbenchers have laid a series of amendments aimed at keeping the option of a full customs union with the EU on the table.A customs union, which is now Labour’s policy, would allow tariff free trade with the EU after Brexit, but would commit Britain to imposing EU tariffs on goods coming from outside the EU and prevent it from striking independent trade deals.Cabinet ministers at Wednesday’s Brexit subcommittee were unamimous in favour of the government’s policy of leaving the customs union, Downing Street sources said.They said May had underlined the fact that remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit would leave Britain with less power over its own trade policy than it has today.During the meeting, sources said business secretary Greg Clark and Hammond both sought to impress on their colleagues the urgency of providing business with a clear answer to the question of what customs arrangements they are likely to face in future.Brexit secretary Davis and Eurosceptic colleagues believe the customs partnership would be cumbersome and bureaucratic – while backbench leavers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, claim that it would be “deeply unsatisfactory”.Mogg’s European Research Group submitted a 30-page report to No 10 in advance of Wednesday’s meeting setting out the model’s shortcomings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91df1cd4351136126dfe9337d2ad0b963448b009/0_44_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a83319ea5632cd89c90221612ac8854","title":"local elections 2018 polling day live","story":"Follow the latest developments as voters go to the polls in the biggest test for the political parties since the general election.Unlike Theresa May, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, turned up at his local polling station without his polling card or his spouse.You do need proof of ID to vote in Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking where controversial pilot schemes are running. Ministers say the scheme will help combat electoral fraud but critics argue it will suppress turnout. None of the five English boroughs taking part in the trial has experienced a single instance of polling station impersonation in the past decade. There have been more complaints and reports of problems about mandatory voter ID being piloting Bromley, Woking, Gosport, Watford and Swindon (see earlier). Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has prompted outrage from senior Belgium politicians by claiming that Belgium is not a nation. Speaking in the European Parliament Farage said: “Belgium is not a nation and maybe that’s why you’re happy to sign up to a higher European level.“You’re losing folks, you’re losing. Brexit is the first brick out of the wall, you’ll learn the lesson, the days of this project are over. “We want to live in nation-states, not false, artificial creations.”Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, responded angrily. The  quoted him saying: “Mr Philippe Nigel Farage you are slipping into populism and extremism and I don’t think that is worthy of your political party.”Former Belgian prime minster, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief negotiator on Brexit, said Farage would find out how real Belgium is when England play them in World Cup on 28 June. Former Labour minister Stephen Timms points out that the government has still to decide on customs arrangements just months before an October deadline for concluding the Brexit negotiations. “How many weeks longer will it be before our government has a clear position on customs?” he asks.Davis replies: “The clarity of the position on not being a member of the customs union is absolute and has been since the beginning, unlike his own party who have had a number of different positions on this matter. It is incredibly important that we get this right, not just for trade, which is massively important, but also for the extremely sensitive issue of maintaining the peace process in Northern Ireland. And I don’t undertake to put an artificial deadline on something as important as that.”Meanwhile Brexit secretary David Davis is taking questions in the Commons on exiting the EU.He is ducking questions on the fraught issue of the customs arrangements, after the government’s inner Brexit cabinet broke up without agreement on Wednesday. “It is no surprise that it takes some time to nail down this policy,” he said after laughing off a question about whether he would resign over the issue. HuffPost’s Paul Waugh has more battlegrounds to look out for (in addition to those we mentioned earlier). Hillingdon has got little coverage but it could turn out to be a surprise Labour win if the party can mobilise its forces and if Tories stay at home. And don’t forget Hillingdon is home to Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge seat.Outside London, the collapse of UKIP’s vote virtually guarantees both Labour and the Tories will increase theirs overall compared to 2014, when most seats were last fought and when Nigel Farage won the Euro elections on the same day. It will be fascinating to see just which party benefits most from the Kipper collapse. The Tories and Labour alike would be delighted to take Dudley or Walsall from no overall control, as well as Basildon, Thurrock and Cannock Chase. Trafford, an island of blue in a sea of Greater Manchester red, may well see the Tories lose control but it is really difficult for Labour to win seats needed to take it outright. If it does, however, it may come down to the party causing an upset in Altrincham. Yes, that’s the backyard of Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee – the man who knows just how many Tory MPs want to get rid of their leader ...There are no elections in Scotland today, but politics and wrangling over Brexit continues ....Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, has predicted the dispute over Scotland’s new powers after Brexit may end up in the supreme court after the UK and Scottish governments again failed to agree a deal on Wednesday evening.Scottish and UK ministers met in London for a further round of talks but appeared no closer to settling their dispute over whether the Scottish parliament can block UK-wide policy changes after Brexit. The Welsh government signed that deal last week, but Nicola Sturgeon’s government insists their agreement gives UK ministers too much authority over devolved government decision making, in breach of the Scotland Act 1998 which introduced devolution.Sturgeon’s case has been boosted after Scottish Labour and the Scottish Lib Dems backed her stance, despite misgivings over her government’s handling of the dispute.Blackford told the Scotsman and Herald that the UK’s refusal to agree that Holyrood had to give express consent to any changes to UK-wide policies was “demonstrably unwinding elements of the Scotland Act.” He added: “We are right at the wire”The supreme court is already due to hear a UK government case over the Scottish parliament’s decision to enact its own rival Brexit legislation in case Scottish ministers refuse to support the EU withdrawal bill at Westminster.Time is running out for a deal as the House of Lords is due to vote on that bill and the UK government’s compromise offer to the Welsh and Scottish governments next week.Blackford said the only hope of a deal before then would be if the UK government accepted fresh compromise proposals from Lord Hope, a former Scottish supreme court judge, and Lord Wallace, the former Lib Dem deputy first minister of Scotland.The Democracy Club has created online tools to help people cast their vote. Who Can I Vote For tells you who the candidates are in your area and has personal statements from some of them to let you know what they stand for.It will also tell you where your polling station is, as will Where Do I Vote, which will also give you directions to the polling station.And Democratic Audit has a Democracy Dashboard on your local council’s current composition.The voter ID trial is not going down well:And there’s been at least one complaint of polling station staff asking for proof of identity in Bradford which is not piloting the scheme.Theresa May and her husband Philip have cast their votes in Westminster. They came clutching polling cards and left without them. You can still vote without a polling card or ID (except in five areas were trials are taking place). You just need to confirm your name and address.Dogs versus bikes at polling stations:Voting is also under way in West Tyrone in a Westminster byelection triggered when the last MP quit amid claims he mocked victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles, PA reports.Sinn Fein’s Barry McElduff resigned in January, 10 days after a controversy flared when he posted a video of himself with a Kingsmill-branded loaf on his head on the anniversary of the notorious Kingsmill massacre. He insisted the video was not an intentional reference to the 1976 sectarian murders of 10 Protestant workmen by republican paramilitaries near the Co Armagh village of Kingsmill, but he acknowledged it had caused hurt and offence to victims’ families. Five candidates are contesting the subsequent byelection.It would be a seismic shock if the abstentionist 26-year-old solicitor, a political newcomer, did not win a seat the republican party has held for 17 years. Thomas Buchanan is contesting the seat for the Democratic Unionists. The Assembly member - who is the only candidate not aged in his 20s - managed just over half the number of votes notched by Sinn Fein when he ran in last year’s general election. Assembly member and law graduate Daniel McCrossan, 29, is running for the SDLP while local councillor Chris Smyth is representing the Ulster Unionists. Stephen Donnelly is the Alliance’s Party candidate. Given the circumstances around McElduff’s departure, issues affecting victims of the Troubles have been a key feature of what has been a relatively low key campaign. Unsurprisingly Brexit has also featured on the campaign trail in a constituency whose western boundary runs along the Irish border. Previous local elections show that the main opposition party needs to beat the government party by a substantial margin if it was to have a serious chance of winning the next general election, writes local government expert Tony Travers.In a blogpost for the LSE he sets out what the benchmarks for success will be for the main parties. The Conservatives control only two metropolitan districts: Solihull and Trafford. The former is safe, though latter could produce a Labour win. Labour is two seats short of a majority in Kirklees and three short in Calderdale, both in West Yorkshire. Amber Valley, Swindon and Tamworth are narrowly held by the Conservatives and will be a useful test of how the party is doing outside the capital. Indeed, last year’s snap general election and recent opinion polls suggest that the Tories may win seats in parts of the Midlands and the North, sometimes in places where the party has struggles in recent years.Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May have sent out rival polling day pleas for votes on Twitter.We’d like you to show us polling day where you are - share your pictures, videos and stories and we’ll add them to the live blog.

Labour is concentrating its efforts on winning three wards from the Tories, which would be enough to slide the council into no overall control.A political bellwether seen as pivotal to Labour’s success nationally. Labour needs to gain four of the 18 contested seats to take control of the council. The council has been run by a Conservative-Ukip coalition arrangement which is likely to change if the Ukip vote nosees as expected. Ukip is defending 10 of the 13 seats being contested. Labour is defending one and the Tories two. PlymouthLabour is targeting three Ukip seats in what used to be Labour heartland territory. A third of the seats are up for election. The Conservatives are defending twelve seats, Labour seven.If that turns out to be reliable Labour could be heading near to its biggest share of the vote in London.Here are the main boroughs in the capital to watch: Margaret Thatcher’s favourite Tory borough has been a flagship Tory council for 40 years. Labour holds 19 seats and looks like it will make comfortable headway into the mid-20s, but the maths looks more difficult to get a majority.Westminster Like many central London boroughs the campaign in Westminster has been dominated by housing issues. Labour is hoping to exploit Tory links to the property industry and the investigation into hospitality received by the former deputy leader Robert Davis. A YouGov poll last week suggests Labour is likely to fall just short of controlling Westminster and Wandsworth. BarnetIf Labour could take two seats, and the political makeup of the rest of the borough remained unchanged, it would seize control of the council, which has been in Tory hands since 2002. Labour could be in danger of being punished over allegations of antisemitism by Britain’s largest Jewish community punish Labour over antisemitism.But a former Conservative councillor has urged voters to back Labour complaining of a “rightwing and hard Brexit-based leadership coup” in the ruling Tory group. Kensington and ChelseaCould the Grenfell Tower fire cost the Tories a true-blue London council? Labour would have to take 15 extra seats – overturning huge majorities in some – to win control. Richmond, and Kingston upon ThamesThese are two of the best prospects for the LibDems to retake control of councils. Failure to do so – coupled with an inability to defend the London borough of Sutton – would raise further questions about what the party is for these days.Tunbridge Wells Will disgusted Remain voters of Tunbridge Wells punish the Tories? The 18 seats up for grabs include 16 held by Conservatives. The Women’s Equality Party is fielding a candidate in the town’s Culverden ward. Elmbridge Tricky to call. The council is currently run by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and local residents associations. The Conservatives only need three gains for control, but they are defending 12 of the 19 seats up for grabs and could face a backlash from a staunchly Remain backing area. The polls have opened in more 4,300 council seats across England in the first big test for the main parties since last year’s general election. All the council seats in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle are up for election.And in more than 100 council areas, also mostly urban, a third of the seats are being contested.In addition, there are mayoral elections in South Yorkshire, where Labour MP Dan Jarvis is standing in Watford, and in four London boroughs: Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, and Tower Hamlets. Most of the seats being contested were last up for grabs 2014, when Labour made big gains. Labour already controls 27 of the 34 metropolitan boroughs holding elections, as well as 21 of the 32 London boroughs. Labour will be hoping to do even better this time by exploiting government turmoil over the Windrush scandal and ongoing arguments over Brexit. But the run-up to polling day has not been a breeze for Labour either as the party has continued to be dogged by accusations of antisemitism. And unlike in 2014 Labour has been marginally behind in the national opinion polls this time round.We will have all the latest on the vote and any other political news of the day until polling stations close at 10pm.

Yet she found a path back to happiness. What helps her – and others like her – retain their essential optimism?I met Bohdan Pomohač, one of her surgeons, at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “In terms of injuries inflicted by another human being, it’s certainly one of the worst I’ve ever seen,” he told me. Her face was almost completely destroyed her family were able to recognise it was Carmen only by her teeth.When people experience terrible head injuries, doctors can put them into a barbiturate coma in order to shut down brain function. This prevents the brain from damaging itself further by trying to keep going without an adequate blood supply.“Even when I first woke up from the coma I just knew it was such a big event, and it was so strange, that it had other meanings for me,” she says. “I could help a lot of people.”Carmen started doing inspirational speaking. “I looked terrible and people felt so sorry for me, but I wanted to show people it didn’t matter what I looked like,” she says. Photos of Carmen from that time are shocking with all the grafts, she didn’t have proper eyelids, and her eyeballs looked out through small circular holes cut into the skin. She had synthetic corneas and couldn’t blink, and the edges of the skin were red raw.“It forced me to look at the big picture of what life is really about,” she says. “And that’s where I’ve had to go, because this horrific event occurred and I found a way through it. And not because I’m different or special, but because that’s what was meant to be: to show people you can be involved in these incredible events and you can forgive, totally, and move on.”She says she has forgiven her now-ex husband for what he did. (In return for pleading guilty to maiming, he accepted a sentence of 30 to 70 years in prison. He died in prison in December 2017.) “I was never religious,” she says. “I took responsibility for my life. I was not responsible for what happened, for what he chose to do, but I certainly was responsible from that day forward.”Even after leaving hospital, Carmen was still in a lot of pain. The injuries to her skin and the multiple grafts caused tightness when they healed, and this led to all sorts of secondary problems with the mobility of her neck and spine. Still she kept going.Then, on Valentine’s Day 2013, Carmen’s life changed again. She became only the seventh American to undergo a complete face transplant. The operation was performed by Pomohač.Pomohač says that for a long time he didn’t think of Carmen as a candidate for face transplant, because she was so immunologically challenged. All those grafts and transfusions had primed her body to attack almost any donated tissue. But there were several pressing reasons why she needed a new face. The pain and the narcotics, yes, but as well as that, the opening on to her eyeball was getting bigger, and this was threatening the integrity of the synthetic cornea. Then there was the drooling, and the problems with speaking and eating.It’s possible there is a psychological force that carries people through … Sometimes people can surprise you with their resilienceThe operation was a technical success, but then there was the immune system to deal with. Carmen’s body mounted a massive rejection of the face and, for a period of four weeks after the operation, she was pumped up on numerous immunosuppressants. By then there was only one more drug left to use. A full dose would help suppress the rejection, but would also completely wipe out her immune system, to such an extent that any trivial infection would kill her. In the end, with Carmen’s consent, they gave her a little of that final drug it was enough to tame her immune system. She got better. Carmen says she felt she had made a choice to live.“It’s possible there is a psychological force that carries people through, but my official answer has to be that the statistics were still a little bit in our favour,” says Pomohač. “Sometimes people can surprise you with their resilience.”Carmen suffered physical injuries that could easily have killed her. That she survived is remarkable in itself, but what seems even more incredible is how she has not just survived mentally, but developed into someone else – someone who, by her own account, is better.Before, she was a registered nurse and was raising children, and, until her incident, she had not thought about the big questions of life: “I wasn’t going to sit around and complain and cry.” Carmen now says she wouldn’t go back and change what happened: she has grown too much. It is a pattern seen in others who have suffered an incredible trauma, and found a way through it.How do they do it? For physical trauma, it is not so mysterious that some people survive. As Pomohač says, statistically, some people will just make it through. When they do, we are so surprised that we fixate on it, and may even call it miraculous. We remember these people, the extraordinary survivors such as Gabrielle Giffords, and we don’t just shrug and say, “Well, it’s not impossible to survive even being shot in the head.” Statistics aside, medical care is good and the body is capable of amazing repair – perhaps better than we might give it credit for.But it is the mental resilience that is sometimes more impressive. Carmen tells me that we get too caught up in negativity. You’ve got to take control, and make your own choices. “I don’t live like the typical person on the inside at all,” she says. “I have different beliefs that help me go when I’m going.”Some people can ride out trauma and even prosper, when others suffer lingering physiological stress and fear – the hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychiatrist David Wolfe is head of outpatient services at the evocatively named Building of Transformative Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The funny thing, he tells me, is that the people who suffer trauma but actually come out better aren’t the people who are studied. If someone is coping well, they are sent home. Psychiatrists see the people who struggle. But perhaps, he says, people don’t suffer as much as we think.“Psychiatry has been as guilty of this as anyone. You assume that, if something bad happens to someone, they’re going to have some mental problem. It happens when we see patients in hospital with very serious diseases. We think: ‘They must be depressed – wouldn’t you be?’ But, actually, they’re not.”That is not to say, of course, that people don’t suffer and don’t need treatment. According to the United States National Center for PTSD, seven or eight out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. What Wolfe is saying is that it is wrong to assume a traumatic event will be the same for everyone. More often than not it’s more impressive how well people cope with trauma, which makes sense from an evolutionary point of view: it is advantageous to have hidden powers of resilience. “The ability to power through adverse conditions should be there in our DNA,” Wolfe says. “It’s more of a puzzle why, from an evolutionary standpoint, we have problems with that sometimes.”No one does things like this alone, without the friends and family who rally round. Your social network is key to how you deal with trauma. “People who respond well tend to have positive relationships in their life and that translates into positive relationships with their treatment teams,” says Wolfe.One of Carmen’s sisters moved to Boston so she could see her every day while she recovered, even before she came out of the coma. When Carmen left hospital, years before the face transplant, she went to her family. She saw a therapist for a while after she was attacked, but she says her experience was so far off the chart that nobody knew what to say to her. “I cried at my sister’s and my mother’s and bitched a little, and after a year and a half I thought, that’s not going to help me.”I needed to find a way through this … My biggest motivation was that I wanted to be a role model to my daughtersOptimism, not surprisingly, is one of the character traits shared by people who respond well to trauma. “The opposite is hopelessness, which is a feature of depression,” says Wolfe. “Engagement, taking it on, taking on responsibility, and being active in the process – these things go a long way.”When you ask people what keeps them going, Wolfe says, the number one answer is family and kids. People who are resilient look to the future. Carmen had a clear goal: “I needed to find a way through this, because I wasn’t going to go anywhere. I was raising children, there were things I wanted to do. My biggest motivation was that I wanted to be a role model to my daughters.”What about the genetics of resilience? Even when we find genes related to disease, it rarely works on the basis that “you have the gene, you’ll get the disease”. Sure, there are instances, such as familial Alzheimer’s or cystic fibrosis, where this is almost always the case, but most diseases, and almost all traits, are far more complex, and are influenced by many genes. Resilience is one such complex trait.The capacity to be super-resilient may be there even in normal people, but we need guidance and support to find it, maybe from psychotherapy, maybe from friends. We need help to be optimistic, encouragement to take control, and empowerment to be responsible. We need a certain amount of self-love. A touch of narcissism is good. We need to stand up for ourselves so we are not mistreated at work or in relationships, we need to be assertive without devaluing others and have a self-image that is positive without being conceited. This mixture of personality traits will drive you forward. And, if you do not have them naturally, some of them can be constructed.Extracted from Superhuman: Life at the Extremes of Mental and Physical Ability by Rowan Hooper, published by Little, Brown on 3 May, price £14.99 (rrp).

The Temperate House in Kew Gardens is once again, as the naturalist Sir David Attenborough describes it, “a breathtakingly beautiful space”.The great glass and iron doors to this botanical cathedral, first opened in 1863, closed in 2013 for the most complex restoration project in the history of Kew Gardens, and will reopen to the public on Saturday.The building once again shelters several unique species that have become extinct in the wild, including the cycad Encephalartos woodii, which survived since the era when its spikes helped protect it from dinosaurs but is now labelled “the loneliest tree in the world” because only male specimens survive. Attenborough is one of the many local residents who have missed the great glasshouse terribly and will return to it with joy. “When I had an office job I used to come to Kew at weekends when I was depressed and take deep breaths,” he recalled. “It’s lovely.”He described Kew as the most important botanical institute in the world. “In some circumstances the only way you can prove that a particular species is that species is to come to Kew and compare what you have with what is here. This is why people come from all over the world come to the Kew herbarium and to these great glasshouses.”Far more light is now streaming into the glasshouse, partly because the tallest plants, which were brushing the ridge of the roof, have been pruned or replaced with shorter specimens, which has also permitted much denser planting now the space beneath them is no longer shaded out.Another of the treasures is Dombeya mauritiana, a tree that was thought to be extinct in the wild until Carlos Magdalena led an expedition from Kew, found one growing in the highlands of Mauritius, formed part of a human ladder to reach the lowest branch and take cuttings, and brought it back to make Kew the only place in the world to have succeeded in cultivating the plant.Several of the plants are part of international conservation projects to preserve or reintroduce them in the wild, including the Nepalese Taxus wallichiana, source of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.Richard Barley, the director of horticulture at Kew, said the project was an example of world-class horticulture, science and design working together. “It’s been amazing watching this project unfold, the building emerge gloriously and some of the world’s rarest plants safely reach their home.”The oldest part of the Grade I-listed house, designed by Decimus Burton in 1860, was regarded as one of the wonders of the age, and crowds flocked to walk the winding paths and marvel at the exotic plants. However, the full, awesome 628ft (191-metre) length was not completed for decades, and as costs soared the use of cheaper materials and inferior workmanship caused many problems including leaking roofs, corroding metal, rotting timber and decaying stone. Earlier repair jobs caused further problems. The present work, which cost far more than the original estimate of £34.3m and has been funded by grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the government, included reopening ventilators painted shut half a century ago.

Called World Series Rugby, it will involve matches played by Western Force in Perth, which was dropped as one of the country’s super rugby sides at the end of last season, against the three Pacific islands, Hong Kong, the Rebels and the Crusaders.It was devised by Andrew Forrest, the Force’s billionaire backer, who anticipates that next year the series will largely include sides from Asia. World Rugby has given its approval for a series of law changes to be adopted with the aim of speeding up the game.The changes include rolling substitutions, up to 12 for each side one minute for a scrum to be completed otherwise the team considered responsible for holding up play will be penalised lineouts taken when the throwing team is ready, regardless of whether a line has been formed and a power try worth seven points, with another potential two from the conversion, will be awarded if the continuous move starts in the scoring team’s 22. A green light on the goal posts will flash if a power try is on.The aim is to stimulate the game in Australia where grounds for Super Rugby matches are often only one-quarter full and the club scene is flat. Rugby union facing an extinction crisis in Sydney ran a headline this week and if Perth is hardly a union city, it is far from alone.The belief is that non-rugby followers could be enticed if games contain more action and fewer of the game’s arcane rituals, like scrummaging and competing for the ball in a lineout. The more tries the better, although how many points will a side score if a move starts outside its 22, from a scrum or a line-out say, but the ball is passed backwards into it before the decisive break is made?The vast majority of the law changes in recent years have had two central themes: to increase the time the ball is in play and to promote player welfare, but the first has compromised the second. A Rugby Football Union review a few weeks into this season showed the rate of injuries in the Premiership had increased on the previous year because the increased time the ball was in play meant an increase in the number of tackles being made, the area responsible for the majority of injuries.“The attacking side is getting more of the ball because the contact area is virtually not being challenged but facing a greater number of defenders, and we are therefore seeing more tackles,” said the RFU’s director of professional rugby, Nigel Melville. “The increase in tackles is significant as it involves ‘double tackles’ and with greater line speed. And we found last year that it was not the tackled player that predominantly was injured but the tackler.”With the aim of the Perth series to keep the ball in play for longer, expect there to be more tackles and more injuries. The game will move further away from being a contest for possession to one where players smash into each other, no longer a refuge for all shapes and sizes.Australia are not known for placing a premium on scrummaging, but the maximum 60-second affair runs the danger of turning it into a rugby league set-piece, put the ball in and away. Similarly with the line-out: throw in when the opposition are not ready and there is no tussle for possession, nor time for players to get a breather.They will have to wait for a pause in play for injury, although no doubt there will be calls for a rolling substitute to be brought on when a player is down so play can continue and not count as one of the 12. Forrest says that next year’s series will see 10-point tries and set a time-limit on lineouts as well as scrums.How long before both set-pieces are canned and the game moves almost as far away from its roots as the new 100-ball cricket tournament planned in England and Wales? Rugby by name rather than nature, a dumbing down. It is far easier to look at ways of promoting “entertainment” by squeezing features that make union distinct rather than trying to address the central problem of how to create space on the field so that players are not continually clattering into each other from the first minute to last.Not a word about player safety in Perth, but the way the sport is going with each round of league and cup matches scarred by long-term injuries, it could face a class action down the line from players who reach middle age and find that they are unable to work because various parts of their bodies have broken down. Concussion is not the only issue.World Rugby had little choice to approve the law changes with countries like Australia and Scotland, who from 2019-20 will be launching a Super 6 competition to help bridge the gap between club and professional rugby, looking for a stimulus but it needs to tread warily and not be blindly led by commercial interests.• This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

That’s our focus right now.”Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call with analysts, when Musk began cutting analysts’ questions short, costing Tesla over $2bn in market capitalization. “These questions are so dry. They’re killing me,” Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off. He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring. The giant loss in a critical quarter for the 15-year-old company fell short of Wall Street estimates. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss of $3.54 per share. Revenue, however, exceeded estimates of $3.28bn.In April, Tesla said it would not need to return to markets for more capital because it expected to generate cash from sales of the Model 3. But it has had trouble getting them out the door to several hundred thousand people who put down $1,000 deposits to order one.Moody’s Investor Service downgraded Tesla’s debt into junk territory back in March, warning at the time that Tesla didn’t have cash to cover $3.7bn for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that come due early next year. At the end of last year the company had a total of $9.5bn in long-term debt.“The negative outlook reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall,” Moody’s wrote in a note to investors.Tesla has had only two profitable quarters in its nearly eight years as a public company.The key to raising cash to cover expenses is production of the Model 3 mass-market electric car, which starts at $35,000 but can easily top $50,000 with options. Musk said the restructuring would involve getting rid of third-party contractors that have grown out of control. “We’re going to scrub barnacles on that front,” he said.He admitted that Tesla made a mistake by adding too much automation too quickly at the factory.The plant has missed Musk’s forecasts by a wide mark. When production started last summer he promised to build 20,000 Model 3s during the month of December. Instead, Tesla made only 2,425 during the entire fourth quarter.Then Tesla forecast 10,000 Model 3s per month at the end of the first quarter. As it turned out, just under 9,800 were assembled from January through March, Tesla said in April. The Fremont, California factory was shut down for four or five days last month to clear production bottlenecks, Tesla said.The company, which also makes solar panels, predicted in April that production would climb rapidly through the second quarter and reach about 5,000 vehicles per week – which would return Tesla to its originally promised 20,000 per month rate – around the end of June. It predicted high sales and strong cash flow in the third quarter. “As a result Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,” the company said.The Model 3 is the most important piece of Tesla’s plan to become a mainstream automaker. At one point it had more than 500,000 potential buyers on a waiting list. But in April the company conceded that some had canceled, although it refused to give numbers. Tesla said reservations “remained stable” through the first quarter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10af03ea440a46d532a66b0089364655b98025c4/0_45_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef40f5e76784350ff26dfd729dbb09d4","title":"can i buy a fast and powerful work laptop for under 700 pounds budget","story":"Ivana is on a budget but still wants a new 13in machine that can handle tougher tasks than email and browsingI left my corporate job a few months ago and now need to purchase a new laptop for my work. I am looking for a 13in laptop in the £500-£700 range. I am not too picky about the aesthetics. What matters most is that it’s fast and can handle more tasks than just email and browsing. What is my best bet? IvanaThis is an interesting question, partly because the mainstream PC market is broadly ided into two main groups. There are lots of low-end laptops aimed at consumers, and they usually cost around £250 to £500. (Yes, there are even cheaper systems.) Examples include the Lenovo Ideapad 110, Asus VivoBook, and lots of HP Pavilion and Dell Inspiron laptops. Most are relatively slow, but some are fast enough for your purposes.There are also lots of upmarket laptops for high-end buyers and freelancers, and they usually cost from £750 to £1,500. (Yes, there are even more expensive systems, especially the ones designed for gaming.) Examples include the Dell XPS 13, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, HP’s Spectre 13 and EliteBook x360 G2, the Microsoft Surface range and many more. Most of them are thin and fast, but you are also paying a premium for aesthetics.The third option is to look at laptops aimed at IT managers, especially those in large corporations. Most are designed more for durability, reparability and predictability than for speed or style. The main examples are Lenovo (formerly IBM) ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, and HP Elitebooks. You can also buy refurbished models of these machines from corporate asset management companies such as Tier1Online.It would be useful to know the specification of the laptop that you used in your corporate job, for comparison purposes, and the work involved. How fast was the processor? How much memory did it have? Did it have a traditional hard disk drive or a faster SSD? What was the screen resolution?Was your corporate laptop as fast as you wanted, or did it feel too slow?If you know which CPU you had, you can check its PassMark score, or find it on Notebookcheck’s list of mobile processor benchmarks. You will then be able to make sure you buy a faster CPU and as much or more memory than you had before.A typical corporate laptop today might have an Intel Core i5-5200U or similar processor, 8GB of memory, and a 128GB or 256GB SSD. I reckon you would find that a usable specification. However, it can be very frustrating to go from a fast laptop to a slow one, so try to avoid that.As for size, 13.3in screens are not as popular as they used to be, and there are now models with 10.1in, 11.6in, 12.5in and 14in screens as well. Ultraportables with 10.1in or 11.6in screens are a bit small for everyday use, but 14in models are becoming increasingly common.If you buy a consumer laptop you’ll have the advantage of shopping for one of the better models, but there’s not a lot to choose between them. There’s been a trend towards more solid construction and better trackpads, along with higher prices.You can check out the different models at stores such as PC World and John Lewis, but there are many other suppliers. I’m linking to PC World partly because I did that myself on Tuesday.The main drawback with the HP Pavilion 14 and similar consumer laptops is that most of them have a standard Windows screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. But if this is what you’re used to, you probably won’t mind.One of the advantages of buying a Dell business laptop – not an Inspiron – is that you can add next-business-day on-site service for a low price. For example, you could get a 14in Vostro 5471 from Dell’s small businesssoho range with a Core i5-8250U8GB256GB spec for £579 plus delivery and VAT. You could then add four years of collect-and-return service for £50.36, or four years of on-site service for £95.14. I’ve used this service in the past, and have it on my current Dell desktop. I can confirm that having someone turn up on your doorstep to fix things is fantastic value for 46p a week.The Vostro 5471 with the spec mentioned, four years of ProSupport Plus and on-site service, VAT and delivery currently comes to £885.05. It busts your budget, but if you are used to getting good IT support, it’s probably worth it.Bear in mind that you can also buy HP laptops direct and add three years of pick up-and-return service for £79 or less. If you like the HP Pavilion 14, you can get a 14-bk002na with 4GB and a Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen for £429, or a silver Pavilion x360 14-ba007na with 8GB and a 1366 x 768 screen for (flash sale) £449.10. Both these laptops have Core i3-7100U processors and 128GB SSDs.Most Pavilion 14 laptops have two memory slots, so you should be able to expand a 4GB system to 8GB, but check before buying. Their usual maximum memory is 16GB.Most refurb buyers are looking for cheap machines, typically under £250. In your case, you could get a high-end laptop – the latest X1 Carbon starts at £1,439.99 – within your budget.Refurbs are available from many other websites including Laptop Outlet and Dell Outlet, as well as on Amazon and eBay. As long as you go for a decent spec, they should do what you need.Have you got a question?

A TV show that outperforms its movie inspiration can be a rarity – the myriad Marvel spinoffs seem largely content to settle as inferior versions of the big screen blockbusters, and shows that lean too heavily on nostalgia tend to collapse under the weight (see the gossamer-thin Scream, for example, though I have a soft spot for the sitcom version of Clueless). But other shows are improvements on the feature length versions that came before them, using the extra space and length to explore aspects that may have been pushed to one side.Peter Berg based his 2004 movie of the same name on a non-fiction work by HG Bissinger, which told the story of the Permian Panthers, a high school football team in Odessa, following them for one season in 1988. The movie tweaked real life events to add dramatic dazzle, and it’s an excellent sports film, that rare kind that makes sport watchable even for those who don’t know their block from their blitz. But Berg has said that in translating the story to the big screen, he had to put the book’s focus on social issues away, and that even when making the film, he realised that television would allow him the space to do that. The show, which ran for five seasons from 2006 to 2011, succeeded in making a drama ostensibly about sports, but really about family, community and society, creating the fictional town of Dillon for its Panthers to call home. It may have lacked Billy Bob Thornton, but it made stars out of Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton.Joss Whedon had what he called “major involvement” in the original 1992 film version of his teenage superhero, for which he had written the script. While it’s fun to watch in retrospect as a kitschy early 90s relic, it appears that Whedon’s vision was twisted out of shape by Hollywood’s dark forces. “It didn’t turn out to be the movie I had written,” he has said. By the time it reappeared on the small screen, five years later, it was clear that it would be everything the film should have been: wry, witty and inventive, exploring teenage life (and eventually adulthood) through that tragicomic supernatural filter. It always exists slightly outside of the “golden age of TV” boxset canon, perhaps because it lacks “serious drama”, HBO-ish credentials, but it’s certainly one of the most loved shows of all time, and for many, one of the best.Though there are surface similarities between the Starz series and the 2009 Steven Soderbergh film from which it took its title – both are about an escort named Christine, both explore the service-industry economics of sex work, and both have proven isive – the TV show proved to be a bold and accomplished curiosity. (The first season, that is, rather than the odd, disjointed second.) Riley Keough’s turn as Christine, a trainee lawyer who begins a sideline in escorting, is extraordinary, and Amy Seimetz and Lodge Kerrigan have turned the vicious, icy world of corporate law into a blithely nightmarish trap of claustrophobic boardrooms and anonymous hotel rooms. It’s an unusual and demanding show that’s more arthouse than blockbuster, and it greatly improves upon what Soderbergh came up with. Michael Crichton directed his own story in 1973. His vision of a historical theme park populated with robots who are infected with a virus that causes them to turn against human visitors has aged surprisingly well, considering the movie sets its future in 1983. It contained a kind of prescience about technology and development that made it a natural choice for a 21st century reboot. While some find HBO’s big-budget reimagining to be slow and overly complicated, the expanse of the small screen perfectly suits the magnitude of the story, and allows it room to develop beyond a cautionary horror story. Roman world and medieval world are yet to make an appearance in the show, but it’s been so successful that such growth seems inevitable. It might seem a stretch to argue for the full superiority of Fargo the TV show to Fargo the movie, which is pretty close to cinematic perfection. So rather than calling it an improvement, it might be better to think of it as an equal partner. Plenty of series have attempted to rework hit films for the small screen, and plenty have fallen into the trap of relying too heavily on viewers’ nostalgia and good will. But Fargo works hard to live up to its name, taking the feel and template set by its impeccable forebear and adapting it to a new format with elegance. Its three seasons so far have often felt like elongated movies, not least because of the star power they’ve commanded."},{"url":null,"title":"border patrol agents second class citizens","story":"’s review of claims made against US Customs and Border Protection over the last dozen years shows cause for concern over unreasonable search and seizureThe moment that Jorge Rodriguez noticed five armed border patrol agents beginning to surround his car, his first instinct was to tell his 17-year-old cousin, in the passenger seat next to him, to pick up his hands and not make any sudden movements.The pair, both US citizens, had been stopped on their way home from a movie at a checkpoint outside of Las Cruces, New Mexico, approximately 60 miles north of the border. The young men had already answered questions about their nationality and where they had been that evening.They were not armed. The only problem was that Rodriguez, then aged 23, had refused to consent to a warrantless search of his family’s vehicle, citing the constitution.“I was trying to show my cousin ... ‘You didn’t do anything wrong and you have rights,’” Rodriguez said. But wary of the officers’ hands on their holsters, he opted to concede, granting the inspection of his backseat.“I’m aware of what this agency has gotten away with,” he said.Following the election of Donald Trump, Rodriguez’s experiences with border patrol checkpoints prompted him to walk away from a spot in a PhD program, in favor of organizing “Know Your Rights” trainings with the New Mexico American Civil Liberties Union. The organization is also challenging the agency’s controversial practice of boarding Greyhound buses.A  investigation this week has revealed that the US government has paid out more than $60m in legal settlements over a decade, where border agents were involved in deaths, driving injuries, alleged assaults and wrongful detention. The research also pieced together cases of 97 civilians who died after encounters with border agents, which took place in 11 states and up to 160 miles inside US borders.Civil rights advocates are not alone in promoting oversight of the border patrol’s inland operations.“Increased spending on border security in recent years hasn’t been accompanied by necessary oversight, accountability or transparency,” said Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke. “This has led to concerns over the protection of constitutional rights and situations where we have failed to properly train and equip our agents and officers, who have some of the toughest jobs in government.”A rising star in the Democratic party, with his sights set on unseating Senator Ted Cruz in the November mid-term election, O’Rourke has twice introduced bipartisan legislation that proposes the appointment of regional oversight committees, revamped agent training, transparent reporting and the immediate commencement of congressional studies on agents’ use of force, migrant deaths and operations inland.As a US citizen and grandson of a guestworker, Rodriguez was raised approximately 80 miles north of the border in Hatch, New Mexico – a tiny village with an outsize reputation as “the chile capital of the world”. Although Hatch’s prized commodity draws tourists, the town has few restaurants and stores, prompting residents to regularly commute to nearby Las Cruces. A permanent border patrol checkpoint awaits them on the return, established on a highway roughly 60 miles inside the US from its border with Mexico.In order to run to Target for his mom, go to prom, spend time with his grandmother or simply explore the nearest big city of El Paso, Texas, Rodriguez has had to answer to armed federal agents. He estimates he’s undergone more than 300 checkpoint stops over the last nine years, since he turned 16 and began driving.Already the largest and most funded federal law enforcement agency in its own right, the border patrol is part of the umbrella agency US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP’s approximately 60,000 employees are split in four major isions: officers who inspect imports an air and marine ision agents who staff ports of entry – international airports, seaports and land crossings and the approximately 20,000 agents of the border patrol, who are concentrated in the south-west, but stationed nationwide.The border patrol enjoys extraordinary police powers. Agents operate checkpoints where they stop motorists everyday without suspicion, and in the interior of the country up to 100 miles, they can board planes, trains and buses. There is no geographic limit to which agents can otherwise conduct stops amid roving patrols, though they are technically required to have reasonable suspicion to do so. Extending from not only land borders but also the Pacific, Atlantic, Gulf and Great Lakes coasts, the 100-mile zone encompasses two out of every three Americans, 12 states in their whole or near entirety and nine of the 10 biggest cities in the nation.The upshot of living in the borderlands, according to historian Kelly Lytle Hernandez, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of the book Migra! A History of the US Border Patrol, is: “Governance untethered by the United States constitution.”In theory, the border patrol’s powers are limited by the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Agents should not conduct stops amid roving patrols without reasonable suspicion, and requested searches can be refused, barring a warrant. A spokesperson also said the agency is “committed to the fair, impartial and respectful treatment of all members of the trade and traveling public”.But the ’s review of claims made against the agency over the last dozen years shows cause for concern.When sued in civil court, a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said it does not refer those allegations of misconduct to the Department of Homeland Security’s complaint review system because agency policy determines that any incident involving injury or death would have already been investigated internally.Suits resulting in settlements have been filed by: an Ohio father who said he was detained while walking his child home from school an agent with a hand on his holster a Greyhound passenger and naturalized citizen who described being forced off a bus, assaulted and hospitalized before being released without charges and a tourist who said her family was followed through a checkpoint by an agent who sexually assaulted her.Other settlements include a lawfully present refugee pulled off an Amtrak train in Montana and placed in immigrant detention for a week a US citizen who said he was coerced into signing his own deportation order, after a Texas sheriff’s deputy stopped him 80 miles inland and called border patrol a pregnant, lawful visa holder who said she was denied food and insulin during a 16-hour detention.Further settlement cases uncovered by  research included a 64-year-old San Diego market vendor who said an agent held a gun to her head for no reason two prison guards of color who described being stopped multiple times by agents in Washington state a Native American man who said he was beaten after leaving a checkpoint in order to race his mother to the hospital a Somali refugee with lawful asylum status who was detained for 49 days after passing through a checkpoint and an Arizona pastor who said he was targeted with a Taser after refusing to consent to a vehicle search.“I already live in a region where my mere existence is criminalized,” Rodriguez said of the recent national guard deployment, describing border communities as the “collateral damage” of ramped up enforcement policy, “whether it’s the wall or a wall of agents”.“We live as second-class citizens,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e46a994bcdae3b8e7a29fc1dfaad98b8c0b7095/0_257_880_528/master/880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cd6be706e9cbaf942231a1b1758bf77","title":"toronto canada news car hang bridge","story":"Canadian police initially said the hollowed-out Honda Civic found dangling linked to a movie shoot. Now they don’t knowWas it the aftermath of a horrific accident? An art project? A prank?Police and passersby were left perplexed and concerned after a burned-out car was found dangling precariously from a Toronto bridge as traffic rumbled overhead.Soon after the blue sedan was spotted during rush-hour traffic on Wednesday, police, firefighters and paramedics showed up to assess the mysterious car. Strung up by a cable, it floated over a grassy area and posed no danger to public safety, officials said. City police at first said it was a prop for a movie shoot. But after speaking with city officials, they retracted this explanation. No movie shoot had been authorised, they said, and police were now investigating how exactly the car ended up suspended in mid-air. The hollowed-out Honda Civic appeared to be scrubbed of all identifying markers it bore no licence plate, several windows were missing and its underbelly had been stripped. “I just saw some of the pictures myself and I was mystified as to how the car ended up there,” Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, told reporters on Wednesday. “You’re always very puzzled as to how a car would have got into that particular situation.”Social media stirred with speculation. “What’s weirder: the fact that there’s a car dangling from a wire below a bridge, or that nobody has the slightest idea why or how the car got there in the first place?” wrote one person on Twitter. Another pointed to the confusion over whether the car was linked to a movie shoot, asking: “Are the cameras, cast and crew hiding? Did they finish filming and simply forget the dangling car?”A myriad of theories soon sprung up online to explain the car, linking it to everything from aliens to a student end-of-year prank – a nod to a 2001 prank that saw engineering students at the University of British Columbia suspend a red Volkswagen beetle – outfitted with a Canadian flag – from San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. Hours after the car in Toronto was spotted, the city’s fire department managed to safely lower it to the ground. Police said they were continuing to investigate."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many of the deceased hit by collapsing walls, trees in north and west of countryAnti-ship and surface-to-air systems set-up on reclaimed land in South China Sea, reports sayIndian court tells government to enlist overseas specialists to fix pollution damageReuters journalists working on investigation into killing of Rohingya men and boys were arrested in DecemberAustralian Cardinal is most senior Vatican official to be charged over sex abuse in Catholic ChurchCase brings fresh attention to abuse of power by mighty \u0027chaebol\u0027 conglomeratesCardinal is most senior Catholic official to be tried on such allegationsWang Yi travels to Pyongyang days after landmark summit with South KoreaForeign observers will be permitted to view dismantling of nuclear facilitiesSpecialist fire crews called in to deal with smell at Royal Melbourne Institute of TechnologyState media says discussions wrapped up with amicable \u0026lsquofeelings of blood relatives\u0026rsquoKim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in pledge formal end to Korean War and peace on peninsula\u0026lsquoJust like a pine tree, I hope our relationship will be forever green,\u0026rsquo says Kim Jong-unMan wielding knife outside school in Shaanxi province also leaves dozen children woundedZagreb also angry over behaviour of Serb war criminal and deputy Vojislav SeseljAfter previous deals fell through, more work lies ahead to achieve real regional stabilitySymbolic walk across demilitarised zone and tree-planting will underpin historical talksReport sheds light on North Korean announcement that it will suspend testingDetails emerge for meeting where peace treaty and denuclearisation to be discussedCrash happened at unmanned railroad crossing in rural Uttar Pradesh state"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481694.1525330729!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"karl marx s insights retain their clout and relevance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA statue of German philosopher, economist, political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx is placed on its plinth in his birthplace of Trier, Germany. Photograph: Harald TittelAFPGetty His view over Brussels’s magnificent Grand Place from La Maison du Cygne was a vivid architectural representation of what he was trying to write. History as class struggle.The tall gothic and baroque guild houses, an expression of the rise to pre-eminence of the merchant bourgeoisie, and the town hall spoke of municipal power and wealth. And surrounded by a city teeming with the poor and hungry . . .An impoverished Karl Marx, barely 30, spent three years here from 1846.And in the back room of what is now one of Brussels’ most chic restaurants, with friend Friedrich Engels, he laboured over their most important work, The Manifesto of the Communist Party, part-groundbreaking philosophical and historical thesis, but above all a call to action that would reverberate around the world.Two hundred years ago next Saturday, Marx was born in the small German town of Trier, where EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will deliver a speech for the birthday unveiling of a 5.5m statue of the local boy, a gift from the People’s Republic of China.“Nobody can deny that Karl Marx is a figure who shaped history in one way or the other,” a commission spokeswoman defensively insisted. “Not speaking about him would come close to denying history.”His intellectual legacy is everywhere. Last week with a laugh, a senior Irish diplomat described to me the “mao dun” – Chinese for “internal contradiction” – at the heart of a commission proposal. Doomed, he was suggesting, like capitalism and its contradictions, to the dustbin of history.Neither Juncker nor my diplomat, you may be relieved to hear, are closet Marxists, but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 , they, like many others, economists, historians and philosophers, have been willing to look again seriously at the ideas of a man at whose door most of the 20th century’s woes have been unfairly laid by conventional opinion.And yet. No more than the bloody crusades, or the terreur and the guillotine can be said definitively to characterise Christendom or the French Republic,\u0026nbsp Marx too can and must be rescued from his disciples’ excesses and intellectual rigidities. “If anything is certain,” he would claim to “revolutionary phrase-mongering” adherents, “it is that I myself am not a Marxist.”Rescuing Marx is first and foremost about rescuing his thinking from the charge – a caricature – of dogmatism and rigidity. On the contrary, it is above all a methodology of thinking and analysis, not a fixed position, not a political programme, nor a set of explicit prescriptions for the world’s ills.One that explores the dynamics of constant change in the economic, political and ideological spheres as the working-out of contradictions. In Marx’s view, these are the tensions between old ways of creating the means of survival, and their social organisation, and new, emerging forms of economic and political organisation. Irreconcilable opposites in whose synthesis the new world is created.But for Marx, and his “historical materialism”, history itself was inherently open-ended: “All history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.”“In Marx’s vision, which cannot recognise anything as absolutely final,” the late philosopher István Mészáros wrote, “there can be no place for a utopian golden age, neither ‘round the corner’ nor astronomical distances away. Such a golden age would be an end of history, and thus the end of man himself.”It was not Marxists who announced “the end of history” on the fall of the Soviet Union, supposedly the triumph of capitalism as the highest and unsurpassable civilisation. Such finality is absurd to them.Marx’s analysis and insights have made much of modern sociology and shaped political and historical theory. Gender theory, race theory, and new insights into humanity’s ecological death wish, have all added to and deepened his insights into the exploitation that drives capitalismEven right-wing economists nod at his critique of the market. The jury may still be out on whether, as he predicts, there is an inevitable tendency for the rate of profit to fall.But, most recently, in a powerful dissection of the data on wealth concentrations and distribution over the last 250 years, French economist Thomas Piketty convincingly linked growing global inequality to the fact that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth. In other words, as Marx predicted, under capitalism the rich will get richer and the poor, poorer .“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point is to change it,” Marx wrote in 1845. And the view of the cobbled square from the Maison du Cygne remains. Unchanged."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481967.1525291648!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish border centre stage at westminster and in eu negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid Trimble was one of a number of speakers in the House of Lords who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Peter MorrisonAP PhotoWednesday’s debate in the House of Lords about Brexit and the Border was an elegant affair, with Chris Patten and Northern Ireland minister Ian Duncan quoting lines from Louis MacNeice to one another and peers displaying elaborate courtesy as they argued. The debate underscored the central position the Border now occupies in the Brexit negotiations, and in Theresa May’s efforts to agree a common position with her ministers on future customs arrangements.The debate also exposed, however, the rawness which has entered into the atmosphere between London and Dublin and between unionist politicians and their counterparts in Dublin.Patten poked fun at Brexiteers who blamed Dublin for the impasse over the Border, and at David Davis’s theory about who was pulling Leo Varadkar’s strings.“The secretary of state for exiting the European Union said that the problem was because the leader of the Fine Gael party, the Taoiseach, was in the pocket of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin and Fine Gael – I think the secretary of state must have been away the day they did Irish history at school,” he said.But former Alliance leader John Alderdice said the idea of a coalition between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin was not such a fanciful one and historian Paul Bew agreed, pointing to an email exchange between the Taoiseach’s office and Sinn Féin “showing an intimacy of spirit which nobody would have believed possible from a Fine Gael government”.David Trimble was one of a number of speakers who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland, suggesting that making deals over the heads of the people was a greater threat to peace than Brexit.“If future arrangements are to be made over the Northern Ireland Border it is obvious that you have to have the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives closely involved in that. If not, you are going to make the same mistake,” he said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481907.1525286901!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may postpones customs decision after ministers disagree","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg denied that Brexiteers had given Theresa May an ultimatum on customs arrangements with EU. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireTheresa May has postponed a decision on Britain’s future customs relationship with the European Union, asking officials to draw up revised proposals after her senior ministers failed to agree a common approach. The cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee met on Wednesday after Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers called on the prime minister to abandon one of her two customs proposals.Reports after the meeting suggested that Ms May’s new home secretary, Sajid Javid, and defence secretary Gavin Williamson joined Brexiteer ministers to oppose the proposed “customs partnership”, which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Ministers opposed to a hard Brexit, including chancellor Philip Hammond and business secretary Greg Clark, spoke in favour of it.The European Research Group (ERG) of 60 MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the customs partnership as unworkable and urged the government to focus exclusively on a second option of a customs arrangement known as Maximum Facilitation or MaxFac, which would use technological and administrative measures to make customs controls less intrusive.Mr Rees-Mogg denied that the group was threatening to move against the prime minister unless she took the customs partnership off the table.“There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market,” he told the BBCHousing minister Dominic Raab, who campaigned for Brexit, said\u0026nbspthose opposed to the customs partnership option appeared to be winning the argument.“I always keep an open mind on this because I do think when it comes to Brexit we are going to be forging a distinct path, the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union but also avoid the hard border as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment the way I read it is that those in favour of max fac are winning the argument,” he said.At prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms May said there were “a number of ways” to deliver frictionless trade and avoid a hard Border in Ireland, fuelling speculation that the government is looking at a third option in an effort to unite the cabinet. Asked about the prime minister’s remarks, her spokesman said the government’s ideas on the customs relationship were evolving.“Work has been ongoing on two options that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along the prime minister said there’s a number of options of ways to proceed,” he said.Labour’s Stephen Doughty, who supports a campaign for a second referendum on leaving the EU, said the government was negotiating with itself about customs options Brussels has already rejected, and the government’s negotiation with itself was going about as well as its negotiations with the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“With less than six months to go before the final Brexit deal is supposed to be agreed, Ministers are still fighting among themselves about which of their two discredited customs proposals to persist with. Our European negotiating partners, who have for good reason already dismissed both proposals as unworkable, must be baffled as to what on earth the government wants,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

However, it excludes retailers.Earlier this week the April PMIs for manufacturing (10 per cent of the economy) registered a 17-month low for activity, while construction (6 per cent of output) was judged to be only “treading water at best”.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, attributed the sharp GDP slowdown in the first quarter to the severe snow storms of March, but the Office for National Statistics sought to downplay this explanation.Many analysts blame a combination of last year’s inflation spike and uncertainty from firms about post-Brexit trade arrangements for the UK’s underperformance relative to the US and the EU since the 2016 Brexit vote.However, there has been a slowdown this year in the eurozone too, with eurostat reporting on Wednesday that the 19 member currency bloc’s GDP grew by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, down from a 0.7 per cent rate at the end of 2017.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But when it came to releasing the record and the licensing, marketing and manufacturing that goes along with it, they needed to employ experts with all the knowledge and experience that comes from working at a label.Enter Absolute Label Services. Absolute was started by Henry Semmence and Simon Wills 20 years ago. But it has grown rapidly in recent years as music industry margins have shrunk and artists have sought more control over their profits. All three UK major labels now have a label services ision: Universal has Caroline, Warner Music has ADA and Sony has RED, which merged with The Orchard in 2017. Absolute has stayed independent, offering artists that once belonged to majors an alternative – especially heritage acts that can rely on a fanbase to buy tickets to shows.Mark Dowling (left) and Simon Wills (right) are the directors of Absolute Label Services (Courtesy Photo)Absolute started distributing records in 1998 when physical albums were the only product. “We offered a service where we could get records to record shops,” says director Wills. The company introduced more services over the years as artists needed more resources to make the most of their recordings. It added digital delivery, syncing and licensing operations, and other services to make sure bands get royalties when their music is used. It continues to develop its proprietary digital portal, which gives real time information on sales and streaming, so artists can see if sales spike in a certain territory after a show, for example. Mark Dowling, Wills and Semmence maintain full ownership of the company alongside Deborah Cutting, finance director. This independence can be an appealing prospect to new artists. As major labels have become more cautious, acts often have to do some of the ground-breaking themselves before they can hope for a contract.No artist has proved the potential of self-releasing more than Stormzy. He was reportedly offered record deals with all three major labels and turned them down, choosing instead to distribute his 2017 album Gang Signs and Prayer through Warner label services ision ADA, with WarnerChappell handling publishing. Absolute works with growing artists including Gizmo Varillas, Ferris \u0026amp Sylvester, 67 and Guvna B. But its bread and butter has been returning acts including Bananarama, Lisa Stansfield and of course, Steps. “Absolute have plugged a gap in the market for heritage act – which is really an act who have come out the label system and come out the other side,” says Jon Webster, a music industry consultant. Richards herself says: “It’s a different time. The whole music industry has moved on so much.”Steps signed a traditional record contract with Jive Records when they formed in 1997 that gave them a 20 per cent cut of the royalties, while the label took the rest. Richards says the band never really knew who was paying for things: “I remember being plonked on private jets to take us from Birmingham to London. It was so extravagant. But the amount of records that you sold in those days far outweighed the money that was spent.”Steps sold 2.5 million copies of their first album worldwide, establishing a huge fanbase that the band hoped would still be behind them when they started hatching plans for the reunion. “Everyone had their hopes, but we didn’t know what a Steps album would sell,” says Richards. “It’s very difficult to get a record deal anyway, there are fewer deals and less money than in 1997.”Plus they were wary, second time around, of being ripped off: “It’s only from being ripped off that we learned our lesson. We wanted to make sure that this time we knew what’s going on and being with Absolute gives us that.”Working with Absolute gave Steps the opportunity to agree budgets up-front: “It’s nice to know where every penny is going and how it will affect your album. It’s all very much linked.”The campaign exceeded all expectations. The album Tears on the Dancefloor landed at number two on the charts, selling 115,000 copies. A 22-date UK area tour sold out. By the end of the tour, they had played to 250,000 people and appeared on prime time slots on Saturday night TV.“Steps had done the hard part of connecting and engaging an audience,” Dowling says. “If you’ve got that audience there, why would you go to a label and sign away the control?”How independent artists have changed the music industryThe prospect of running their own campaign is too much work for many emerging artists. “It’s bloody hard work to do it yourself,” says Webster. “If you have something that explodes, you’ve got to be on top of your game to do all those deals. I always say to people, ‘This is really hard work – it’s not just put out a single and employing a plugger and a press officer.’”Yet for some heritage and emerging artists, label services are providing an important alternative. “It takes a lot of getting used to but at the end of the day, we are in control of the budget and at no point do we have to do something we don\u0027t want to do,” says Richards. “Back in the day, we had no choice.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

scowling celestial body annoyed that a rocket ship has crashed into its eye in A Trip to the Moon (1902), Melies was most recently seen in Martin Scorsese\u0027s film Hugo (2011) where he was played in old age by Sir Ben Kingsley.He was born in 1861, the son of luxury shoemakers who - after attending the prestigious Lycee Louis-le-Grand, completing military service and serving an apprenticeship as a clerk in London - shunned the family business to work as a conjurer at the Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris.Here, Melies developed a fondness for stagecraft and visual effects, working with mechanical automata, trapdoors and lighting, eventually selling his boot factory shares to his brothers and buying the theatre outright. After seeing the Lumiere Brothers sensational moving picture camera in action in 1895, Melies rushed out to establish his own studio and began making films that featured clever illusions and tricks created by experimenting with double exposure, cutting and rewinding, building on his theatrical innovations.Using elaborate painted sets akin to those of Paris\u0027s music halls, Melies was a true pioneer who played a key role in the evolution of cinematic technique and the medium\u0027s storytelling grammar.He also had an acute sensitivity for the sort of blockbuster spectacle audiences would be attracted to.Specialising in horror and steam punk science fiction, taking inspiration from the fiction of late Victorian visionaries Jules Verne and HG Wells, his most famous film remains A Trip To The Moon, which starred acrobats and dancers from the Folies Bergere and the Chatelet ballet.As fantastic as this is, perhaps even more extraordinary is the later Tunnelling The English Channel (1907), in which he effectively predicted the advent of Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel.Other celebrated works including The Vanishing Lady, The Haunted Castle (both 1896), The Astronomer\u0027s Dream (1898), Bluebeard (1901), The Impossible Voyage (1904), The Merry Frolics of Satan (1906) and Baron Munchausen (1911).The aftermath of a cyclone in a short by Georges Melies (Getty)Tragically, after more than 500 short films, Melies\u0027s career collapsed with the onset of the First World War. He went bankrupt and was forced to sell his back catalogue to Pathe.An early setback had come when Melies planned to release A Trip To The Moon in America, only to find that Thomas Edison\u0027s representative Al Adabie had secretly copied a print of the film after bribing staff at a London cinema and had already released it in the US without permission - an early and particularly devastating case of film piracy.Later reduced to running a toy stall and selling sweets at Montparnasse train station in Paris (as depicted in Hugo), Melies became so embittered that he dug a hole in his garden, filled it with what remained of his priceless reels and memorabilia and burned it all.What was lost that dark day is almost too painful to think about.However, he did live long enough to see his films reassessed and acclaimed and to receive the Legion d\u0027Honneur before finally passing away in 1938.27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Amazingly, a colour print of A Trip To The Moon was unearthed in a French barn in 2002 in which each frame had been meticulously hand-painted by a large female work force a century earlier.The world greeted its restoration and re-release with the same excitement and anticipation of its premiere at a Paris fairground and the film continues to inspire affectionate parodies and homages in everything from the Smashing Pumpkins\u0027 video for Tonight, Tonight (1996) to Futurama (1999-2013) and The Mighty Boosh (2004-13).or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Although they had wings, their skulls more closely resembled those of dinosaurs.Ichthyornis, unlike Archaeopteryx, is thought to have been a strong flier. Its streamlined body was simplified and adapted for flight like modern birds.“Despite the modernity of its body and wings, it retained almost a full complement of dinosaurian teeth, and it had a strong bite with large, dinosaurian jaw muscles,” said Mr Bhullar. “However, it perceived its world and thought like a bird, with a bird’s enormous eyes and expanded, modern-looking brain.”While primitive birds such as Confuciusornis, which lived 125 million years ago, had beaks, the small one sported by Ichthyornis is the first known to have modern attributes like a “pincer tip” for grasping, pecking and fine manipulation.“Its sharp teeth probably would have assisted in holding onto slippery marine prey, while the incipient beak at the tips of its jaws probably would have allowed it to manipulate objects with fine dexterity such as modern birds can do, and preen its feathers,” said University of Bath paleontologist Daniel Field.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Ichthyornis had a two-foot wing and probably ate fish and shellfish. It shared the skies with flying reptiles called pterosaurs at a time when dinosaurs dominated the land.Toothed birds vanished along with the dinosaurs and many other species after an asteroid impact 66 million years ago.Ichthyornis fossils were first written about by Yale paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in the 19th century and were later cited by Darwin as strong support for his theory of evolution.The Yale and Bath researchers used CT scans to analyse the newly discovered specimens.

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove also oppose itWith the overall balance of the cabinet six to five against the proposal, one source said Brexiteers now believe they have “killed” the option.Peers defeat government on plan for Irish border after BrexitUK police use EU system that may be lost post-Brexit 539m times a yearThe best Brexit deal does involve leaving the customs unionThis is why you should care about the local electionsAre countries really ‘queuing up for trade deals’ with Brexit UK?May ‘held hostage by extreme Brexiteers’ as customs decisions delayedBut in a sign that Ms May is not ready to let go of it, the prime minister asked for more work to be done on both of her existing proposals.The partnership plan would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf at ports and airports, passing on a share of the money to Brussels – then if the UK sets different tariffs from the EU, traders would claim refunds from HMRC for goods that stay in Britain.Olly Robbins, Ms May’s Europe adviser, regards the partnership as a means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, while keeping the UK out of the European customs union. Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.Boris Johnson: Northern Irish border being used to try and keep the UK in the customs unionThe group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous”, “deeply unsatisfactory” and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or even “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

First of all, there isn’t a lot of evidence that signing new free trade agreements (FTAs) would deliver an economic boost anything like enough to compensate for the hit from leaving the EU single market and customs union. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says “simple arithmetic” and “a basic understanding of trade” show the gains from such FTAs are likely to be small.But another problem is that countries aren’t exactly queuing up to do deals with Britain – or where they seem to be, things aren’t as straightforward as they appear.The US president has been enthusiastic about a trade deal (AP)Donald Trump has said he wants a “big and exciting” trade deal with the UK, which sounds promising. In reality, however, the price of such a trade deal could be so high as to be unworkable. A previous US-EU attempt at a trade deal, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, failed after Mr Trump suspended negotiations because it wasn’t favourable enough to the US. But on this side of the Atlantic, even that deal was equally controversial because of US stipulations on scaling back welfare and hygiene rules for farm animals, as well as opening up public services like the NHS to US private corporations.With polling showing the public firmly against US foodstuff such as chlorinated chicken coming to Britain, any deal likely to be acceptable to Mr Trump would be sure to contain extremely unpopular and controversial elements – particularly if it were to be negotiated at speed.The UK has a huge trade deficit with China, the workshop of the world (Reuters)China’s approach to post-Brexit trade has been cautious, despite multiple visits from senior British politicians to pay their respects and drum up support.The country’s envoy to the EU, Zhang Ming, has specifically said that China would not open trade negotiations with Britain if the UK did not manage to conclude a withdrawal agreement with the EU – which some Brexiteers are pushing for.President Xi Jinping called for a “golden era” of relations before Britain voted to leave the EU, but enthusiasm has been less obvious since the referendum. Following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, warned Chinese firms operating in the UK they should now take “precautions” – widely interpreted as coded support for the defeated Remain campaign. Japanese car firms have invested heavily in the UK in recent decades (AFPGetty)Japan has been among the most vocally negative about Brexit and explicitly said it would prioritise the EU for trade deals over Britain.The country, which reportedly sees Brexit as an act of “self-harm”, said doing a deal with the EU – which would now not apply to Britain – would be “first and foremost a priority” over negotiating anything with the UK, according to its diplomatic minister.Japanese companies are particularly concerned about the UK’s exit from the single market and customs union, which is seen as important for industries like carmaking, which rely on frictionless trade set to come to an end under current government plans.Businesspeople from the country who met with Theresa May earlier this year told her openly that they would leave the UK if they could no longer make a profit under the new arrangement.Trudeau with May in Ottawa (AFPGetty)Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he wants a “seamless” trade deal with the UK – aiming to “flip over” a new agreement between Canada and the EU so that it still applies to Britain.This sounds positive, but there are three significant things to bear in mind. The first is that even if this goes well, there would be no gain for Britain – it would merely be replicating an existing trade deal that the UK already benefits from as an EU member.The second is that it may not be as simple as it sounds: little progress has been reported so far on issues such as what share of the EU’s quotas belongs to Britain. The third is that Canada is not a huge economy, equal to one of the larger 28 EU member states – its GDP sits roughly between Italy and Spain. British objections to sky high tariffs on Scotch whisky held back an EU-India trade deal (Getty)Yashvardhan Sinha, India’s high commissioner to Britain, has specifically said the country is not in a “rush” to do a trade deal with Britain after Brexit. India, whose economy is set to overtake Britain’s in size over the next few years, has been in trade talks with the EU for a trade deal since 2007.In fact, the country does see Brexit as an opportunity to do a deal – with the EU. Britain has been holding up a trade deal between India and the EU by opposing the more liberal immigration and visa regime sought by the South Asian country’s government. Another sticking point is the sky high tariffs on Scotch whisky imposed by India, which Britain would not accept as part of a deal.Despite a series of limited commercial agreement already inked between the two countries, both these obstacles would remain to a full UK-India deal after Brexit – indeed, Delhi has specifically said it wants visa liberalisation as a condition.British beef producers could face competition (Jo Turner)Mercosur is a South American trade bloc that includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which must be dealt with collectively for trade deal purposes because they’re in a customs union together.Brazil and Argentina have both expressed an enthusiastic interest in doing a possible deal with Britain – with the most notable outcome a flood of cheap South American beef into UK markets. That means lower prices for British consumers, though potentially difficult times ahead for this country’s beef producers.The South American bloc is already negotiating a separate trade deal with the EU, having relaunched stalled negotiations in May 2016 as the UK voted for Brexit. A trade deal with Britain might be more simple to conclude than one with the EU, however, because the UK has fewer and weaker agricultural interests than most European countries. The EU’s new trade deal with Mexico includes agricultural produce between the two blocs (Reuters)The European Union and Mexico reached an agreement on a trade deal in April of this year, getting rid of practically all tariffs. The deal is currently being finalised into a legal text. Trade secretary Liam Fox has said he wants to roll over this EU trade deal to keep its benefits after Brexit – but as with Canada’s EU deal, the process might not be straightforward, and there has been little reported progress so far.South Korea already has a trade deal with the EU (Alamy)South Korea is in a similar situation to Canada: the EU has a trade deal with the East Asian country already, and Britain wants to roll it over once it leaves to keep the benefits. As with the other countries in a similar situation, this will not be straightforward – but British business have notably raised concerns that South Korea in particular will ask for concessions and favourable terms from the UK to keep continuity. The Department for International Trade says it has “already held discussions with more than 70 countries” and insists “none have displayed any interest in disrupting trade flows, or in erecting barriers to trade that do not currently exist” – but trade experts are concerned that countries will use the UK’s situation to try to extract favourable terms.May gladhands Turnbull at Downing Street (Getty)Australia has been perhaps the most positive about a trade deal with the UK after Brexit. The country’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was “very keen” to do a deal with the UK “as quickly as possible”, in a joint press conference with Theresa May last year. Australia is, however, a relatively small player on the world stage, with an economy well out of the top 10 and roughly the size of Spain.Australia is also already negotiating a free trade deal with the EU, having opened preparatory talks with the bloc years ago – so Britain may not actually gain any new advantage from negotiating a separate agreement.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour are also targeting Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.The Lib Dems are hopeful of keeping hold of Sutton, their last London council, and hope to seize Kingston from the Tories.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that back Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party are also targeting Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 shows 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.And though the stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, a large Jewish population could yet reject the party over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have had no paperwork on this.What followed was a public appeal for information about Eunice and the mysterious grave amid fears that the police would have to exhume the site.Rev Walters said this week: No one can of course legally place any form of memorial or decorated grave space in a graveyard or cemetery without permission.Unless someone steps forward to claim responsibility soon then we may have to refer the matter to the police for investigation and these items will be removed.But now, thanks to our investigation, Eunices family have come forward to reveal all about their cherished late mother and her desire to be interred at her mothers side.Eunice was born the youngest of eight children to Wilfred and Lavinia Birch in January 1928.Tragic mum Lavinia passed away just the following year, leaving agricultural worker Wilfred — who only had one arm after a mill accident aged 17 — to bring up the children.Eunice left school at 14, and after her father remarried the following year she moved in with her brother and then her sister until her marriage.She met husband Col Eric Hall when he was an airman stationed in Lincolnshire and she served in the NAAFI as a caterer.They would go on to have five children who were raised in Darlington, Co Durham — but absent Eric left much of the parenting duties to doting Eunice.Her son Jon, 68, says she would often talk about her own mother, whose distant but glowing memory she appeared to treasure dearly.Speaking from his home in Torquay, Devon, he told The Sun Online: She talked about Lavinia all the time, even thought she had very little recollection of her.All she had was two photographs of her mother. But it was her wish for as long as I can remember that when she died she would be placed with her mum.It meant that when she died in Torquay, where she had lived for 16 years to be closer to her children, the family felt obliged to bury her ashes nearly 300 miles away back in Lincolnshire.Children Alan, a policeman, stage manager Jon, retired headteacher Sandie and youngest daughter Julie, who has since passed away, held a quiet but heartfelt burial ceremony with the previous vicar at St Margaret’s Church in May 2011, a month after Eunice’s death.But they are baffled that no records exist — because they claim they spent days in conversation with the church to organise their tributes.Sandie said: “I don’t know why the current vicar was so confused. We liaised for weeks with the previous vicar and his secretary to make sure we got everything absolutely right.“We asked to put up a plaque but we were told we had to get the right stone, with the right lettering, to comply with regulations”.The children would visit the grave as often as they could but eventually last October it was in need of freshening up.Jon said: Sandie went straight round to B\u0026ampQ and bought some green kerbstones and some lovely gravel. She bought some plants and shrubs and made the grave look lovely again.And that’s where I think the confusion with the current vicar came from.It was just a loving family who was very proud of their mum, to make sure everything looked perfect.Maybe we should have asked permission to tidy up the grave again, but we had already asked permission six years earlier, and thought that was enough.Our mum never knew her own mum and that was a source of great sadness to her. But now they are together again – and probably having a little chuckle.The Sun Online has reached out to Rev Walters to comment but he was not available."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402620631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"young lefties reveal they cant stand corbyn any more and have abandoned labour ahead of local elections","story":"The 35-year-old FGM campaigner stood as a candidate for the Womens Equality Party last year, knowing she wouldnt win but keen to promote the feminist cause.But Labour activists told her in public that she shouldnt be taking part at all - hinting that as a black woman and an immigrant, its disloyal for her to challenge Labour.That was the final straw, Nimco told The Sun this week.

Being on the centre ground really freaks them out.How are you going to deliver better services when you’re driving out people who create wealth? They still think that the biggest issue is about keeping the jobs down the mines!None of those who spoke to us can bring themselves to vote Labour next time around - saying theyll back whichever party can keep Mr Corbyn out of power.Nimco - who joined Labour when Gordon Brown was leader - said: I’m happy to back the Tory party to keep Corbyn and his Shadow Cabinet out of power.The Labour party doesn’t represent the people that it says it speaks for. I want them to change - but there’s no hope for them.Robbie added: I would actively vote Conservative at elections to undermine Corbyn’s Labour party.I think Jeremy Corbyn is very much a red line in terms of ever supporting the Labour party again.And Sam - despite being a Labour official until recently - concluded: I would have to vote against Labour because it comes down to a choice between party and country.

Harry, 33, joked he “got down on one knee” to ask Wills to return the favour he had performed for him at his wedding to Kate in 2011.Here are the other key players — minus of course, the family member Harry would most liked to have attended, his beloved mother Diana.He was with Harry on the infamous lads’ trip to Las Vegas in 2012 when Harry played pool while naked. Skippy was also there when the royal jumped into a ­nightclub swimming pool in Croatia fully clothed in 2011.CHARLIE VAN STRAUBENZEE, 29: Has known Harry since their days at Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire. Old Harrovian Charlie works in finance and is due to marry film-maker Daisy Jenks, 27, later this year.TOM VAN STRAUBENZEE, 35: Charlie’s elder brother, hard-partying “Vans” is a friend of both Wills and Harry and was married to Lady Melissa Percy, daughter of the Duke of Northumberland, before their bitter divorce two years ago.ADAM BIDWELL, 42: Stockbroker “Bidders”, as Harry calls him, dated singer Katherine Jenkins in 2013. He was on the infamous Vegas trip with Harry and Skippy.ARTHUR LANDON, 37: Another Vegas survivor, he inherited £500million when his land-owning dad Tim died in 2007, allowing him to accompany Harry on his jaunts.Before the Vegas trip he posted a snap of his suitcase showing he had packed a gas mask and several fancy dress outfits.WILLIAM VAN CUTSEM, 38: Prince George’s godfather and a life-long friend of Wills and Harry. Prince Charles’s closest friend was William’s dad Hugh van Cutsem and all the princes attended his funeral in 2013.MARK DYER, 52: Prince Charles’s equerry acted as a surrogate second older brother to Harry after Diana died. The former Army officer is married to Texan heiress Amanda Kline and Harry is very close to both. Meghan was pictured with the couple last June, watching Harry play polo.JESSICA MULRONEY, 37: Meghan’s BFF from Toronto and daughter-in-law of former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney. Has helped Meghan plan wedding and pick dress designer.LINDSAY ROTH, 36: Meghan’s best pal from university in the US, now lives in London with lawyer husband Gavin Jordan.She and Meghan have often holidayed together and Lindsay once said: “We’re the kind of friends who can be 3,000 miles away and still be talking about or thinking the same thing.”PRINCESS CHARLOTTE, 3: Wills and Kate’s cutie-pie daughter is guaranteed to steal the show. Has already practised flower girl duties at Auntie Pippa’s wedding last May.BENITA LITT’s twin daughters, 5: As one of their mother’s closest friends, Meghan has acted as the girls’ “fairy godmother” and last year helped the family decorate their Christmas tree.Benita launched bag company Legend of Lido in the States and also runs her own brand agency which helps others to start their own businesses.Harry and Meghan visited the royal mews at Buckingham Palace to select the Ascot Landau, built in 1883, for the procession after their ceremony.He was in one of two used for Wills and Kate in 2011.If it rains, the 1830 Scottish State Coach is on standby.IVY MULRONEY, 4: The daughter of bridesmaid Jessica and her husband Ben is a regular on her mum’s Instagram page with its 109,000 followers.Christened Isabel but known as Ivy, she has already appeared in a fashion photoshoot for ­Canadian jewellery brand Birks, whose rings and necklaces Meghan has often worn.PRINCE GEORGE, 4: He threw a toddler tantrum at Auntie Pippa’s wedding last year, so mum Kate will be hoping he is on his best behaviour with his great Gan Gan, the Queen, in the congregation on May 19.It will only have been four weeks since the birth of his little brother Louis, so nanny Maria Borrallo will be on hand to keep the youngsters in order.JASPER DYER, 5: In April 2017, Harry revealed he has “five or six” godchildren, one of whom is thought to be Jasper, son of usher Mark Dyer.DORIA RAGLAND, 61: As Harry’s future mum-in-law, social worker Doria clearly gave her seal of approval to the match — she was the first of Meghan’s family to meet Harry and she flew 2,500 miles from her LA home to Toronto for the closing of the Prince’s Invictus Games last September.Doria is also a yoga instructor, so should be able to show the couple some relaxation exercises in case of wedding day jitters.THOMAS MARKLE SENIOR, 72: The former TV lighting director worked on iconic shows such as Married With Children. One thing Harry can be sure of — his future father-in-law knows all about ­marriage, having been wed twice himself.Meghan was just six when her parents divorced in 1987.

The family tried to ignore them because we didn’t need to prove anything.Then I said, ‘let’s do the test then, to prove it and put a stop to them (rumours).”But when he received the results he was stunned to discover he wasn’t related to the couple who had raised him.The shocked family then started a desperate search for the truth - and their long-lost son.They asked the hospital Monsenhor Genesio for the names of all the babies born between October 1 and 7 1980.Only two on the list were boys, and when they found a photo of one of them - Noel -  they were sure he was the one who was their biological son.However, when they spoke to a neighbour where Noel used to live they were told the tragic news he had died aged just one.The couple gave up the search, but Noel’s sister, Nelma Rezende, started her own hunt for her real brother on learning of the Gaspars story from the neighbour .Nelma’s husband Caio eventually tracked Romualdo down after finding his godparents through the local registry office.He said when he finally saw a photo of Romualdo he felt sick as the similarity to his wife was incredible.At that moment I had no doubt that he was my wife’s brother,” he added.After Nelma made contact with her biological brother, a DNA test confirmed he was the son of Nelma’s parents, Osvaldo and Valdevina de Lima.This week Romualdo finally met his biological parents, who live just a few miles away in the same town.He also discovered he has eight more brothers and sisters and 18 nieces and nephews.His real mum Valdevina, who lost the boy she believed was her real son in 1981, told Brazil’s G1 website: “After 38 years, at first I thought this was all a joke.“But over time the penny dropped, that it was all true.”Romulado added : “For me, this has no price.

It is likely to anger critics who claim the merger will see job losses, store closures and higher prices.Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself ahead of his interview about the merger.He later apologised for his unfortunate choice of song, which he says was on his mind after he saw it performed in the musical 42nd Street last year.Sainsburys said their boss was simply trying to clear his mind, adding: To attach any wider meaning to this innocent, personal moment is preposterous."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004025960991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may customs union brexit cabinet sajid javid","story":"The new Home Secretary stunned the Prime Minister by declaring he was “the new kid on the block” as he shredded her Customs Partnership plans at the three hour showdown.The ex-Remain supporter tipped the balance of the 11 strong committee just three days after being appointed, leaving Mrs May looking “visibly shocked to have lost the room” according to one insider.The PM was lobbying for a customs partnership solution where the UK collects duty on behalf of the EU, but Mr Javid said the flawed plan would hinder Brexit Britain trading around the world - to the delight of Brexiteers.Tonight, No10 sources admitted Mrs May’s preferred plan could not go forward in its current form after the furious Cabinet and public backbench opposition.And Mrs May tasked her officials with going back to the drawing board and “refining” how Britain’s customs and trade relationship will work with the EU and avoid a hard border with Ireland.Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and his team are expected to come forward with amended proposals swiftly so that ministers can try arrive at a preferred option possibly as early as next week.Cabinet Brexiteers David Davis, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and Michael Gove favour a ‘Max Fac’ proposal where smart cameras and pre-registration is used to monitor goods crossing the Irish border.And tonight they won the crucial backing of Mr Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, who also said he had “grave concerns” about Mrs May’s solution.That left the PM, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley outnumbered.It is understood that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington also sided with the PM’s torpedoed plan.The No10 climbdown came after a day of bitter sniping at Theresa May from vocal backbench critics.Mrs May was branded a “corpse” by furious Eurosceptic Tories today as they warned a betrayal over EU customs would trigger a flurry of letters demanding a leadership contest.Tories seething at No.10 said a “number” of Brexit backers were ready to pen letters to Tory backbench boss Sir Graham Brady – formal demanding a contest for a new leader.They told The Sun that even Tories in marginal seats believed a change – as they believe an election could take place this OCTOBER due to Brexit deadlock.It followed the revelation that 60 Tory Eurosceptics have sent the PM a 30 page report detailing their opposition to the plan for a post-Brexit customs partnership with the EU.One stormed: “No.10 should have seen this coming. People have been in to see Theresa May in the last 24, 48 hours and see just sits there and doesn’t say anything.“She’s like a corpse, all the blood has drained out of her. If they do this people are going to start putting in more letters to Graham Brady.”Tonight Labour MP Stephen Doughty blasted: “The Government’s negotiation with itself is going about as well as its negotiations with the EU.“With less than six months to go before the final Brexit deal is supposed to be agreed, Ministers are still fighting among themselves about which of their two discredited customs proposals to persist with.”And the pro-EU best for Britain campaign said the PM must “get a grip and lead in the national interest.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sorry, these questions are so dry. They\u0027re killing me.\"The call then moved onto questions from retail investors on YouTube.The eccentric South African-born entrepreneur has said he \"sleeps at the factory\" in an attempt to honour his promise to produce 5,000 Model 3s a week.Currently only about 2,000 of the cars are being produced each week, with more than 500,000 people having made paid reservations for the affordable mass-market electric vehicle.The Model 3 starts at $35,000 (\u0026#16325,700) but with options can easily cost more than $50,000 (\u0026#16336,800).Mr Musk has also made the unusual admission that automation is overrated and more humans are needed to build the cars.\"We have temporarily dialled back automation and introduced certain semi-automated or manual processes while we work to eventually have full automation take back over,\" the company said.Speaking about Tesla\u0027s increasing cash flow problem, he said: \"I\u0027m feeling quite confident about hitting positive cash flow in Q3. This is not a certainty.\"It does appear quite likely in my view. We are going to conduct a reorganisation, restructuring of the company this month and make sure we are well set up to achieve that goal.\"In particular the number of third-party companies we\u0027re using has gotten out of control.
