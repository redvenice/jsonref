Not tonight, at least. Pogba is still injured, or recovering from injury and probably leaving the club at the end of this contract in the summer, just as he did a decade ago. Rangnick has started making hopeful noises about Pogba performing only because he wants to leave. For somebody on a short-term contract himself, that could suit him just fine.  The reality is that, with or without Pogba, Manchester United could very easily lose to Brentford tonight, a team that has spent the last week getting tonked by both Liverpool and Southampton.

Speaking at her daily briefing yesterday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki instead stressed the accomplishments of Biden’s first year in office, including boosting coronavirus vaccination rates and getting the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. “We need to build on that. The work is not done. The job is not done. And we are certainly not conveying it is,” Psaki said. “So, our objective -- and I think what you’ll hear the president talk about tomorrow -- is how to build on the foundation we laid in the first year.” The press conference is scheduled to begin at 4pm ET, and the blog will have updates and analysis once it starts. Stay tuned.Thom Tillis, a Republican of North Carolina, pledged that he would leave the Senate if his party ever amended the filibuster -- or rather the legislative filibuster, as Republicans already eliminated the filibuster for supreme court nominees. “The day that Republicans change the rues for the filibuster is the day I resign from the Senate,” Tillis said.  “And I believe that I have a number of members on my side of the aisle that would never do it. So you don’t have to worry about the argument, ‘If you don’t change it now, they’ll just change it when they hit the trifecta.’ It’s not going to happen.” It will be interesting to see if those comments ever come back to haunt Tillis.“President Biden and the senators exchanged views on the best ways the United States can continue to work closely with our allies and partners in support of Ukraine, including both ongoing diplomacy to try to resolve the current crisis and deterrence measures,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.  “President Biden commended the strong history of support for Ukraine from both sides of the aisle, and agreed to keep working closely with Congress as the Administration prepares to impose significant consequences in response to further Russian aggression against Ukraine.” Secretary of state Antony Blinken is also in Ukraine today, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before traveling to Geneva for talks with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Friday. Blinken has warned that Russia could take “further aggressive action” against Ukraine “at any moment,” the ’s Luke Harding and Andrew Roth report: The large equestrian statue of the former US president was blighted by its being accompanied by sculptures of a Native American man and an African man, flanking Roosevelt, on foot and slightly behind him, in contrast to his sitting high on his horse. Removal of the statue was suggested by the museum and backed by the city authorities in the summer of 2020, at the time of the biggest nationwide uprising for racial justice and equity since the civil rights movement, following the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. The statue has been protested for decades with critics saying it, in the words of the New York Times, “symbolized the painful legacy of museums upholding images of colonialism and racism in their exhibitions..... The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.The Senate is holding a debate as the chamber prepares for a procedural vote on Democrats’ newest voting rights bill, which combines elements of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. In her floor speech moments ago, Murkowski reiterated her commitment to protecting voting rights but said she did not believe this bill sufficiently covered states’ rights to set their own election laws. McConnell accused majority leader Chuck Schumer of launching a “direct assault on the core identity of the Senate” by attempting to amend the filibuster, which Republicans have repeatedly used to block Democrats’ voting rights bills. “Our colleague from New York will try to kill the character of the institution he is supposed to protect and to serve,” McConnell said. “The legislative filibuster is a central Senate tradition. It is the indispensable feature of our institution. It makes the Senate serve its founding purpose: forging compromise, cooling passions and ensuring new laws earn broad support from a cross-section of our country.” Of course, bipartisan compromise has become increasingly rare in Washington, and using the filibuster to block the opposing party’s bills is now considered standard practice in the Senate.In a sharp shift from Donald Trump, Biden has said journalists are “indispensable to the functioning of democracy”, which the president has repeatedly warned is under threat at home and abroad. Yet press access to the president has been limited.  Biden has held just nine formal news conferences during his first year, according to research compiled by Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. Trump had held 22 and Barack Obama 27 at the same point in their presidencies. Only Ronald Reagan, whose public appearances were scaled back following an assassination attempt in March 1981, held fewer press conferences during his first year. But Reagan did 59 interviews that year, compared with Biden, who has only done 22. Trump, who labeled the media the “enemy of the American people” and once praised a congressman who assaulted a reporter, did 92 interviews during his first year. Biden does field questions more frequently than his predecessors, but takes fewer of them, according to Kumar’s tally. These impromptu exchanges with reporters often follow scheduled remarks or public appearances. “For the president, it is a question of how do you use your time?” Kumar said. “And for Biden, he has wanted to use his time negotiating privately on his policies.” Read the ’s full report: The president is expected to field tough questions about Democrats’ failure to pass their voting rights bill and the Build Back Better Act, as well as his unimpressive approval rating.

Stay tuned.The Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote on the bill later today, and it will almost certainly fail. Because of a Republican filibuster, the bill will need 60 votes to advance, which will not happen in the 50-50 Senate.Schumer sharply criticized Republicans for downplaying the impact of the voting restrictions enacted by 19 states in the past year. “Our Republican colleagues don’t even acknowledge that we have a crisis,” Schumer said, noting that minority leader Mitch McConnell claimed states were not engaged in voter suppression. Schumer outlined some of the restrictions that states have enacted, including limiting early voting and hours at polling places and making it harder to register to vote. “Just as Donald Trump has his ‘big lie,’ Leader McConnell now has his: ‘States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters whatsoever,’” Schumer said.“It is such an important issue that all of us have grave concerns about, and it’s worthy of the time we spend,” Manchin told CNN. “I would like to see us stay on the bill. There’s no use to try to bring this to finality by having a vote that’s going to fail tonight. Let’s just stay on it.” As of now, the Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote on whether to advance Democrats’ voting rights bill, which passed the House last week. That vote, which will need the support of 60 members because of the filibuster, is expected to fail. And as long as Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema continue to oppose rule changes, the bill has no path to passage in the Senate.The Arizona Republic reports that Kelly, who is up for reelection this year, supports a “talking filibuster” rule only for Democrats voting rights bill. “If campaign finance and voting rights reforms are blocked again this week, I will support the proposed changes to pass them with a majority vote,” Kelly said in a statement. “Protecting the vote-by-mail system used by a majority of Arizonans and getting dark money out of our elections is too important to let fall victim to Washington dysfunction.” A talking filibuster would still require 60 Senate votes to cut off debate on a proposal, but that debate would eventually come to an end anyway as the filibusters gave up the floor. Once they did so, the debated bill could be passed by a simple majority of 51 votes. Democrats have been discussing a talking filibuster rule as a potential compromise for those who do not support eliminating the filibuster all together. However, as of now, the talking filibuster proposal does not have the necessary support for approval because Joe Manchin has said he wants all rule changes to attract bipartisan support, and Republicans remain staunchly opposed to weakening the filibuster.The report, which examines the state of play of the ongoing decennial redistricting cycle, notes that Republicans are shielding their efforts to dismantle minority districts by arguing that the new lines are based on partisanship. While racial discrimination in redistricting is illegal, the US supreme court said in 2019 that discrimination based on partisanship was acceptable.  “This cycle is seeing unprecedented efforts to undermine the political power of Black, Latino, Asian, and Native communities through redistricting, especially in southern states that, for the first time in more than half a century, are no longer covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,” the report says.  “Some of the most aggressive attacks on minority power are coming in the suburbs of southern states like Texas and Georgia. There, Republicans have surgically dismantled rapidly ersifying districts where communities of color have enjoyed increasing electoral success in recent years,” it adds. The report also notes that Republicans, who have complete control over the drawing of 187 of the US House’s 435 districts, are making districts much less competitive.  Donald Trump won 54 districts by 15 or more points in states where the GOP controls redistricting under old maps. Under the new plan, that number increases to 70. The redistricting cycle is still ongoing. New York, Tennessee, and Missouri are still among the states where lawmakers are drawing new maps.EMILY’s List, the progressive group that backs women candidates who support abortion rights, said it would withhold its endorsement from Sinema because of her stance on filibuster reform. “Our mission can only be realized when everyone has the freedom to have their voice heard safely and freely at the ballot box,” EMILY’s List president Laphonza Butler said in a statement released yesterday. Butler noted that her group has not contributed to or endorsed Sinema’s campaign since she first won her Senate seat in Arizona’s 2018 elections. “Electing Democratic pro-choice women is not possible without free and fair elections. Protecting the right to choose is not possible without access to the ballot box,” Butler said. “So, we want to make it clear: if Sen. Sinema can not support a path forward for the passage of this legislation, we believe she undermines the foundations of our democracy, her own path to victory and also the mission of EMILY’s List, and we will be unable to endorse her moving forward.”Progressive senator Bernie Sanders has said he may consider supporting primary challengers to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two holdouts in Democrats’ debate over whether to amend the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. Sanders told reporters yesterday that he believes “there is a very good chance” the two senators will face primary challenges because of their stance on the filibuster. When asked if he would consider backing such primary challengers, Sanders replied, “Well, yeah.”  Manchin brushed off the warning, saying, “I’ve been primaried my entire life. That would not be anything new for me.” But Sanders’ comments underscore the growing rift in the Democratic party over the filibuster and, more broadly, the best response to Republican obstructionism. While progressives support using every tool at their disposal to circumvent Republican tactics, centrists like Manchin and Sinema still underscore the importance of bipartisanship, which has become increasingly rare in Washington. Joe Biden will hold a press conference later today, and he will almost certainly be asked what that ide says about his party and whether he can get anything else done in Congress with members of his own party at odds.

It is still undoubtedly the best way to fight Covid-19 ... however, we do not want to deepen fissures in society,” Fiala told a news conference on Wednesday. In December, the previous government ordered Covid-19 vaccinations from March 2022 for hospital and nursing home staff, police, soldiers and some other professions, as well as those aged over 60. That decision brought protests against the measures. The policy turn comes as a wave of the Omicron variant hits the country of 10.7 million people. The health ministry said 28,469 new cases were reported for Tuesday, a record daily number since the start of the pandemic and more than double the 12,371 reported the same day last week. Like other central European nations, the government expects about 50,000 daily cases by the end of the month. In preparation, asymptomatic essential healthcare workers and social service personnel who test positive may be allowed to continue working. Businesses want the list extended. Fiala’s government has also shortened quarantine and isolation times, while launching mandatory testing of employees at companies from this week. Hospitalisations, which peaked in the latest Delta wave at more than 7,000 in early December, dropped to 1,635 on Tuesday from 1,761 reported for Monday.

Rek blamed the death on a local anti-vaccine movement, saying its leaders had “blood on their hands”.

It keeps French Covid infections above 400,000 for the second day in a row. A further 231 people died from Covid-related causes in French hospitals, Reuters reports. Earlier this month French President Emmanuel Macron’s plans for a vaccine passports were approved by parliament, part of a strategy he characterised as intended to suppress Omicron’s spread and “piss off” unvaccinated people. The move follows guidance announced earlier this week in England, UK for five full days’ isolation – provided people test negative by lateral flow on quarantine days five and six. The change reflects latest medical evidence, policymakers said, and is expected to combat staff shortages. The US charted the path on 5-day isolation periods – cut from 10 days – last month but the decision drew scorn from experts for not baking in a test-to-release component. Northern Ireland reported a further six people had died from Covid-related reasons on Wednesday, plus another 4,451 new infections.Russia’s last wave peaked in early November, with cases gradually dropping week on week, but infections began jumping again in early January driven by Omicron. St Petersburg, Russia’s second-biggest city behind Moscow by population, set a new record high on Wednesday – with 4,382 new cases. (Tuesday saw the city report 3,958 cases.) Russia reported a further 698 deaths on Wednesday. Russia has the world’s second-highest death toll from the virus, behind only the US, with Reuters estimating deaths of over 670,000 people. It comes after Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said on Tuesday he was extending work-from-home rules and guidance to protect elderly people until April 1 amid the Omicron climb. “Given the rapid and wide spread of Omicron, it is clear that the workload of outpatient clinics will increase sharply,” Sobyanin said.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSo what’s going to happen with the Leaving Certificate exams? Carl O’Brien, Education Editor, reports.When will we find out if a hybrid option is going to happen?\u0026nbsp As of now, planning is being advanced for the State exams in June.However, pressure is growing from students for a hybrid option that would allow them to choose between sitting exams and availing of teacher-assessed grades.The State Examinations Advisory Group meets on Thursday afternoon to discuss plans for the 2022 exams. This group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school management bodies, the State Examinations Commission and Government departments.No decisions are likely at the meeting: the next two weeks are seen by many as crucial in whether the Government will bow to pressure to deliver a hybrid option. It is acutely aware of the problem it may create further down the road.What level of disruption have students faced compared to previous years?\u0026nbsp In 2020 and 2021, demand for alternatives to the Leaving Cert came at a time when schools were shut and anxiety levels were sky-high.This year, by comparison, the landscape is more settled. Despite some doom-laden predictions, schools are open and the outlook is brighter. Arguably, the smooth resumption of schools weakens the students’ position.However, it’s also fair to say students have also faced significant disruption over the past 22 months, along with high levels of student and teacher absences. The level of disruption was not equal and online tuition varied significantly during school closures.Do modifications to written exams go far enough?\u0026nbsp Last August the Department of Education announced that additional choice would be incorporated into most written exams in 2022, with contingency built in for future disruption.Oral exams will take place during Easter holidays – minimising disruption to tuition – while there is more flexibility on deadlines for coursework.In terms of modifications to the written papers, some are modest and may not ease the burden significantly for students struggling to complete their courses on time. Students argue – with some persuasion – that further change is needed to take account of disruption.Is a ‘hybrid’ Leaving Cert possible?\u0026nbsp In short, yes. It is understood that officials have been working on a contingency plan which involves giving students a choice between teacher-assessed grades and sitting exams.However, it would be different to the “calculated grades” and “accredited grades” models of 2021 and 2020.The absence of junior cycle grades for a cohort of students who did not complete transition year makes it much more challenging to objectively standardise teacher-assessed grades.It remains to be seen how, exactly, this can be done without relying on controversial “school profiling” data. Assessment experts say other statistical methods are possible, but t may be less accurate as those used in previous years.Will teachers facilitate a hybrid system?\u0026nbsp Teachers’ unions were opposed to school-assessed grades in 2020 and 2021 they eventually co-operated on a “without precedent” basis.Once again, unions are opposed to teacher-assessed grades and say they will only co-operate on the basis of “absolute necessity”.However, research has indicated that a significant minority are willing to assess their students. If push comes to shove, it’s difficult to see unions standing in the way of a hybrid system.There is also an uneasy contradiction in their position: two weeks ago, some sought a delayed reopening of school for Covid reasons now they insist that reopening is going so smoothly that a hybrid option is not necessary.Are there advantages to a hybrid system? For starters, it would ease the pressure and anxiety that many students are experiencing.Another benefit is that teacher-assessment can reward students who do not perform well in the context of a high-stakes Leaving Cert exam.In recent years, teacher-assessment led to record numbers of disadvantaged students in Deis schools securing college places given that these students are less likely to benefit from grinds or language exchanges than others, teacher-assessed grades – arguably – even out the playing field.What are the downsides to a hybrid Leaving Cert?\u0026nbsp Champagne corks popped in many households last September when students received record-breaking Leaving Cert results. When CAO offers arrived a few days later, many celebrations turned to heartbreak.Points for entry into college courses soared and many lost out on places due to increased use of random selection.There is also less scope to provide additional third-level college places this year to help ease some of the points pressure.For students, the hybrid option could turn out to be a case of “be careful what you wish for”.More broadly, grade inflation poses fundamental questions over the integrity of results and the value of Leaving Cert achievements."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"how the pandemic exposed the myth of the anglosphere","story":"A park bench in Brockwell Park, London, that was taped off to stop people sitting on it in the early days of the pandemic in April 2020. Photograph: Richard BakerIn Pictures via Getty ImagesYes, he might lose his job, US-resident Brits are currently having to explain to neighbours, friends and Uber drivers. Yes, the prime minister of the actual UK. Yes, over some office parties of less than Caligula-grade decadence.The bemusement of our hosts is not evidence of their slacker ethical standards. Rather, the problem is that Americans tend to underrate how harsh the UK’s lockdown was for much of 2020 – and how correspondingly provocative Boris Johnson’s breaches of it are.In turn, both countries struggle to believe the severity of the restrictions under which Australians have lived. A bid for “Covid zero” made the place all but unvisitable at times, even for passport-holding expats. Melbourne had no fewer than six lockdowns. Unable to renew his near-monopoly on that city’s Grand Slam tennis tournament, Novak Djokovic can attest to the strength of feeling there.All of which gives rise to a question. If there is such a thing as an “Anglosphere”, bound by a deep-seated culture of inidualism, why did the member nations erge so much over the pandemic? Aukus, a naval pact agreed between the three countries mentioned above last September, breathed new life into the idea of English-speaking unity.But the past two years have more often argued against it. The gamut of pandemic measures runs from the relative laxity of the US to, in the case of Australasia, perhaps the severest lockdowns in the western world. Some local authorities in Britain were taping up park benches to prevent strangers sharing them. Try doing that in Dallas or Miami. To the extent that Covid has served as an audit of national cultures, the findings refute the idea of a Washington-to-Wellington communion of values.For the US, with a $21 trillion economy and no express need for the outside world, this is an academic point. But for a midsized nation that has spurned its own continental market, on the hunch that its English-speaking former colonies can step in, the tenuousness of any Anglosphere is more troubling. It implies that national interests still trump (for want of a less loaded verb) ancestral fealties.Steel tariffsTellingly, the US still has steel tariffs on the UK, but not on the EU. Washington’s trade representative Katherine Tai is “confident that we will take this up when the time is right”. It is not known whether she was ruffling Johnson’s hair and praising the quaintness of Regency costume dramas while uttering those words.I spent long enough in Westminster to anticipate the Conservative response here. That is, a Republican administration would have been more generous to the UK. And so we have the paradox of the “special relationship”: it is at once fundamental and entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House.If any good comes of the past two years, it will be a sense of realism in Britain and elsewhere about the US. It is not, as even the French presume, an “Anglo-Saxon” country, whatever that means. It does not share political culture or institutions with the white Commonwealth. First, it broke from colonial rule much earlier and more absolutely than Australia, Canada or New Zealand, none of which are republics. Second, it absorbed such vast and such varied immigration as to become its own category of nation.Whether the events of 1776 constitute a “revolution” (Gore Vidal, noting that the domestic social order was not turned upside down, preferred the term “separation”), they ingrained a mistrust of the state. The consequences are evident in good ways and bad.“A Latin-Slav mixture”, one UK premier called America, and that was in the 1950s. In other words, even if you are a crude ethnic determinist, it makes no sense to assume an automatic coincidence of world views between the US and other countries that happen to speak English. It makes even less to bet your nation’s economic future on it. And given that the US accounts for the lion’s share of the population and economic output of the Anglosphere, that putative grouping has no meaning without it.AmbivalenceThe uniqueness of the US is recorded here with due ambivalence. On the one side, American inidualism prevented the most heavy-handed pandemic measures. It is increasingly plausible that the taped-up benches and Zoom-only funerals had a scarring effect that Britain and other nations will be reckoning with for years.On the other side, there is a pandemic death toll that now well exceeds that of the American Civil War. Either way, as Anglosphere enthusiasts struggle to accept, the US is different. It is not an overgrown Britain. Those who fawn over it most, understand it least. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape. But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsVote of no confidence: What it means and what happens if Boris Johnson is ousted as Prime MinisterJane Hartley, Joe Biden\u0026#39s new pick for UK ambassador, \u0026#39not seasoned enough\u0026#39Migrants classed as adults after claiming to be children could have cases reviewed‘No new evidence’ of women being spiked with needles on nights out, says ex-police chiefEmmanuel Macron calls for EU security pact with Russia in blow to Western allianceFrench capital to get makeover following \u0026#39Paris is ugly\u0026#39 campaignMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"father jihadi brighton family convicted encouraging islamist","story":"The father of a jihadi Brighton family has been found guilty of encouraging Islamist violence in a speech at his local mosque.Abubaker Deghayes, 53, promoted jihad by sword when he addressed worshippers at the Brighton Mosque and Muslim Community Centre.The defendant, who originally comes from Libya, had denied intending to encourage terrorism in his speech to around 50 people, including children and young adults.On Wednesday, a jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty of the charge.It can now be reported that two of Deghayes\u0027 sons were killed fighting for Islamists in Syria and he lost a third in a stabbing in the East Sussex city.Abdul - who had become embroiled with drugs and was murdered by a dealer in 2019 aged 22 - was the twin brother of Abdullah, who was killed fighting in Syria in 2016 aged 18.Their brother Jaffar, 17, was killed in 2014 while trying to overthrow Bashar Al-Assad\u0027s government fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra - an al-Qaeda-affiliated group.Amer, another son and former finance student, who also travelled to Syria, is understood to be continuing to fight in the Middle East.During his Old Bailey trial, jurors were played a video of Deghayes\u0027 speech at the mosque on Sunday November 1 2020.In it, he was seen to make a stabbing gesture when talking about jihad.He told worshippers: Whose power is more powerful than us? Allah is more powerful than you. You, idiots. You kuffar (non-believers)... The non-believer is an idiot. He\u0027s stupid.He went on: Jihad, jihad, jihad. Jihad is compulsory. Jihad is fighting by sword. That means this jihad is compulsory upon you, not jihad is the word of mouth but jihad will remain compulsory until the Day of Resurrection...Prosecutor Ben Lloyd told jurors that the speech was not given innocently or naively.He said: The prosecution case is clear. By the defendant\u0027s words and gestures he was encouraging people to undertake violent jihad.The defendant\u0027s speech demonstrates him to be an Islamic extremist. He is someone who believes in the use of violence in the cause of Islam.Or, at the very least, he was reckless in giving his speech as to whether people would be encouraged.The defendant, of Saltdean in East Sussex, denied wrongdoing, saying he was explaining the meaning of Jihad by the sword as self-defence.The gesture he made was a dance of the blade, he claimed.He also referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as wearing a face covering now after describing Muslim women as letter boxes.The jury was told nothing about the Deghayes family background.In 2017, a serious case review identified missed opportunities to prevent Deghayes\u0027 sons from being radicalised before they were killed in Syria.There was also little understanding of the part religion played in the lives of Abdullah and Jaffar, who were believed to have been with the al Qaida-affiliated Al-Nusra Front when they died, the review added.The report also contained allegations that their father would wake his children up at 4.30am to study the Koran and would whip them with electrical wire or hand out other punishments if he felt they were not doing this properly.After the review, their uncle Omar Deghayes - who was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and spent five years in Guantanamo Bay - hit out at police, claiming they took no action whatsoever while his radicalised young nephews were being racially abused.Following Deghayes\u0027 conviction, he was granted continued bail ahead of sentencing at the Old Bailey on February 25.More from NewsVote of no confidence: What it means and what happens if Boris Johnson is ousted as Prime MinisterJane Hartley, Joe Biden\u0026#39s new pick for UK ambassador, \u0026#39not seasoned enough\u0026#39Migrants classed as adults after claiming to be children could have cases reviewed‘No new evidence’ of women being spiked with needles on nights out, says ex-police chiefEmmanuel Macron calls for EU security pact with Russia in blow to Western allianceFrench capital to get makeover following \u0026#39Paris is ugly\u0026#39 campaignMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron sage lockdown model vs real data","story":"Predicting a pandemic is no easy feat, especially when faced with the many unknowns of a new, highly contagious Covid variant.That was the task facing the Government\u0027s scientific advisers as omicron swept across the UK at the end of last year – a race against time to understand how the mounting wave of infections could hit hospitals.Yet within little more than a month, the worst scenarios drawn up by modellers appear to have been avoided. Admissions have already peaked in England, and the Prime Minister has now announced Plan B restrictions will be lifted next week.This is a long way off the grim picture of the New Year experts presented to ministers – peaks of between 3,000 to 10,000 hospital admissions and 600 to 6,000 deaths a day in January and February, even with Plan B activated. Scientific consensus has moved fast on omicron – and, in turn, highlighted the limits of modelling amid the initial uncertainty.Underpinning the initial modelling was the assumption that omicron was just as dangerous as delta, on top of being more transmissible.Studies have since found that omicron is milder than previous variants – both in terms of hospitalisation risk and the time patients typically need to stay in hospital for treatment.And, crucially, evidence points to omicron being intrinsically less severe than delta – meaning it has a lower impact even when accounting for reinfections and wider vaccine protection in the community.Separately, modellers did not expect people to alter their behaviour of their own accord without the need for government restrictions, and thus slow the spread of the variant.“Current modelling assumes no change in behaviours beyond those previously seen on imposition of equivalent measures in the past,” wrote SPI-M-O, SAGE’s modelling sub-group, in its December 15 consensus statement.“Non-mandated behaviour change, however, has the potential to make a big difference in either direction.”In reality, household mixing fell in the wake of the announcement of Plan B restrictions, as people attempted to avoid having to self-isolate over Christmas or inadvertently bringing omicron back to their families.Boosters also provided the ultimate line of defence, with evidence now making clear that a third dose is effective against hospitalisation from omicron.Early on experts suspected omicron possessed some ability to dodge vaccine protection – but advisers had to grapple with the precise amount of the variant\u0027s vaccine escape, with seemingly small differences having a wide range of impacts on hospitals. What we now know about the effectiveness of boosters was compounded by the expansion of the rollout, which accelerated dramatically towards Christmas. Off the back of the Prime Minister pledging to offer a third jab for all eligible adults by the end of the year, by December 20 England was seeing up to 5m third doses a week.More from NewsPrince Andrew High School, Canada, will be renamed \u0026#39to reflect its values\u0026#39Mother charged with murder after death of 2-month-old baby during lockdownVote of no confidence: What it means and what happens if Boris Johnson is ousted as Prime MinisterJane Hartley, Joe Biden\u0026#39s new pick for UK ambassador, \u0026#39not seasoned enough\u0026#39Migrants classed as adults after claiming to be children could have cases reviewed‘No new evidence’ of women being spiked with needles on nights out, says ex-police chiefMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president biden has humiliated america","story":"It’s never a good sign when a US president throws out a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office on the first day of his presidency. But that’s exactly what Joe Biden did one year ago today, following the example set by his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama.It was evidently an omen. Once hailed as the man who would “restore America’s standing in the world”, Biden is overseeing the stunning decline of the world’s superpower. A year after taking office, he is flailing at home and abroad, and could well end up a lame duck halfway through his presidency.If the Republicans take the House of Representatives and Senate in the mid-term elections later this year, Biden will be practically powerless on the domestic stage to further implement his agenda. He will be reduced to conducting America’s foreign policy, which is already proving to be a monumental disaster.In the wake of the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, America’s standing has sunk to lows not seen since the end of the Vietnam War. Even the Carter days look benign compared with the feckless Biden era.In the past few months, I have spoken to dozens of parliamentarians, officials and diplomats across Europe who have simply lost faith in American leadership. One very senior British MP told me last week that Biden’s foreign policy was “appalling” and “completely useless”. And this is coming from America’s closest friend and ally, the UK. With an unashamedly anti-Brexit stance, and an arrogant willingness to lecture Britain on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Biden has succeeded in undermining the Special Relationship. As for America’s enemies, they see Biden as a soft touch, whose time in office is a welcome opportunity to challenge America’s might and undercut the country’s strategic power. It is no coincidence that, with the former senator from Delaware in the White House, Russian forces are massing on the border of Ukraine, China is openly threatening to invade Taiwan, and Iran is rapidly building up its nuclear programme. Under Donald Trump, the adversaries of the US were far more careful not to pick a major fight with a president who was often unpredictable, and clearly ready to wield American military capabilities – as he did with the perfectly timed drone strike that took out General Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s feared Quds Force, at Baghdad Airport.But Biden’s weakness abroad has been matched by a reckless domestic agenda that plays to the far-Left of the president’s own Democratic Party. A huge expansion of government spending and massive increase in federal debt has helped fuel the biggest rise in inflation in 40 years. Americans have faced a 7 per cent overall increase in prices in the past year, with supply-chain issues resulting in the first major shortages in US supermarkets in several decades.Against this backdrop of economic turmoil, major cities across the country are experiencing soaring crime rates, the direct result of foolhardy Democrat-led “defund the police” initiatives, and dangerous liberal sentencing policies. Looting has become so commonplace in San Francisco and Los Angeles that it barely makes the national news bulletins.Biden’s America has become a byword for economic turmoil, urban decay, rampant lawlessness and far-Left policies that are tearing the fabric of the United States apart.Joe Biden’s first year in office has been catastrophic. With good reason his poll numbers are tanking, and the American people are increasingly turning against the most Left-wing presidency in US history. As witnessed in the dramatic recent election for governor of Virginia, a conservative revolution is coming to the US at both the state and Congressional level, with November’s mid-term elections likely to dramatically shift the balance of power on Capitol Hill.The United States will eventually recover, and it must do so for the sake of the American people and the free world. But we should expect three more years of relentless decline and retreat as Biden’s out-of-touch presidency continues to drive the country’s downward spiral and humiliation.Nile Gardiner is the Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation.

The Bury South MP blasted Boris Johnson and the Tories for being incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves in a brutal letter to the Prime Minister.His sensational departure to the Labour benches moments before Prime Ministeraposs Questions was calculated to inflict a further blow to Mr Johnsonaposs battered authority. The PM is fighting for his political le following the revelations over lockdown-flouting parties in Downing Street, with some Tory MPs openly plotting against him.Ex-Cabinet Minister David Davis rounded on Mr Johnson during the PMQs clash, saying: In the name of God, go.But Red Wall MP Jonathan Gullis claimed some MPs were now withdrawing their no-confidence letters in the PM.  But he told Sky News he didnapost know who they were or how many there were. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson told GB News: Iaposd like to say Iaposm surprised, butanyone was going to defect itaposd be Christian Wakeford - aposWokefordapos, as we call him in that place over there. Heaposs been very vocal in his non-support of the Prime Minister, heaposs upset colleagues quite a few times with some of his tweets and his messages and I say good riddance to bad rubbish. Brendan Clarke-Smith, Tory MP for Bassetlaw, told the Times: “Rather than cause ision, the defection appears to have galvanised many people. “I think it was overstated about actual letters going in, and most people are waiting for the Sue Gray report before saying anything further or making any decisions, which I think is the most sensible course of action.” And a cabinet minister said: “The atmosphere has totally changed. Wakeford’s defection has helped, it’s united the party. In the tearoom there’s total vitriol for those who are plotting to get rid of the prime minister. It’s schoolboy politics but the stakes are incredibly high.” A series of leaked messages emerged of Mr Wakeford criticising Labour, as his former Tory colleagues sought revenge. Mr Wakeford told the PM: I care passionately about the people of Bury South and I have concluded that the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse. Britain needs a government focused on tackling the cost of living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all.It needs a government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves.He told broadcasters it was the most dficult decision I have ever had to makeaposapos The new Labour MP said he was not aware of other possible defectors but I am sure thereaposs a lot of soul searching. Labour has been in talks with Mr Wakeford about switching sides for some time and negotiations predate Partygate, a spokesman said. The party signalled there would not be a by-election - and a decision about whether Mr Wakeford will stand for Labour at next election was a question obviously for further down the line. His decision to join Labour led to calls for him to trigger a by-election, as he was elected in  as a Conservative MP.  In  Mr Wakeford supported a backbench Bill demanding MPs who switch parties face a recall petition. Asked whether there should be a by-election, the Prime Ministeraposs press secretary said: I think that that is up to the constituents of Bury South.Patrick Heneghan, Chair of Bury South Labour Party, said: “I welcome the decision of the local MP to quit the failing Conservatives and join the Labour Party. Mr Wakeford has rightly concluded that only Keir Starmer can provide the leadership that this country is crying out for.Members of our constituency party will be meeting tomorrow to discuss how we will be working with our new Labour MP to fight for the interests of residents and secure a future Labour government. But left-wing grassroots activist network Momentum said he should be nowhere near the Labour party. A Momentum spokesperson said: Christian Wakeford has voted with this hard-right Tory Government almost  times in just two years - voting against measures to stop climate change and tax avoidance and against enabling domestic abuse victims to have access to benefits.He should be nowhere near the Labour Party, and the decision by Starmer to accept him is an insult to the millions of working people who want to see a fairer country.Wakeford should be booted out of Labour and a by-election called immediately.

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

Heres Wakefords letter in fullFormer Tory MP Christian Wakeford has resigned from the Conservative Party and defected to Labour Image: © UK Parliament BySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Despite Bury Southend MP Christian Wakeford having only won his Conservative Party aposRed Wallapos seat in , the Tory MP has now defected to Labour.Boris Johnson has recently been urged by members of his own party, in letters of no confidence, to resign from his role following details about a string of Downing Street parties. Just moments before the Prime Minister was due to take the floor for Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Mr Wakeford wrote a letter to Mr Johnson, slamming his leadership and resigning from the Conservative Party. Responding to news of the letter and resignation, Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would aposwelcomeapos the former Tory Party member: He has always put the people of Bury South first. As Christian said, the policies of the Conservative government are doing nothing to help the people of Bury South and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse. Former Conservative MP Christian Wakefordaposs letter in full to Boris Johnson On Wednesday, January , , Conservative MP Christian Wakeford resigned from the party in a letter, and has now defected to the Labour Party. Mr Wakeford wrote: Dear Prime Minister,I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign from the Conservative Party and apply to join the Labour Party. From today I will be sitting as the Labour MP for Bury South because I have reached the conclusion that the best interests of my constituents are served by the programme put forward by Keir Starmer and his party. I care passionately about the people of Bury South and I have concluded that the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse. Britain needs a government focused on tackling the cost of living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves. Being elected as MP for Bury South was the proudest day of my le. I care passionately about the area and will always be grateful to those who have supported me. Today, however, I am in no doubt that they will be better served by my joining a party that genuinely has their interests at heart.  I have wrestled with my conscience for many months, and you will know that I have made my policy misgivings clear on many occasions in private and sometimes in public. I can no longer support a government that has shown itself consistently out of touch with the hard working people of Bury South and the country as a whole.He continued, outlining his decision to defect to the opposition Party and referring to Boris Johnsonaposs actions as aposdisgracefulapos, stating: Under Keir Starmer, the Labour Party is back firmly in the centre of British politics, in touch with working people, and ready to provide an alternative government that this country can be proud of, and not embarrassed by.My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.  However, I don’t believe all politicians are the same and I do believe in the power of politics to be a force for good. So does Keir Starmer. He has shown that integrity in the way he has led his party on issues that matter to me, not least the vital challenge of combatting antisemitism. I will always put the people of Bury South first and will continue to speak out for the changes the area needs. Changes that can only be delivered by a Labour government with Keir Starmer. Yours, Christian Wakeford.

But that could move againthe virus throws another curve ball into the works, an official said. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. It comes days after Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi insisted there were “absolutely not” plans to axe free LFTs.Downing Street today insisted no decision had been made on when to end free lateral flow tests. But the government’s autumn and winter plan said they would be ended at some point.And today, Boris Johnson announced he wants to ramp down some of England’s other key Covid measures. The PM told MPs he “very much expects” to scrap legally-binding isolation for all Covid-positive people from March  - or earlierhe gets the chance. The Times also reported the government is drawing up plans to shut down testing centres from the spring. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Lateral flow tests remain free to use and we continue to encourage people to access them. In our autumn and winter plan which we published last year we were clear that at a later stage the Government, as our response to the virus evolves, universal free provision of things like lateral flow tests will end and we will update once we are in that position. The spokesman added: Thereaposs been no decision made on when that will be, it will depend on what we see in terms of the epidemiology in this country and we will keep that under review. Mr Johnson said legal restrictions in place for two years will end in a statement to MPs today. He announced Plan B restrictions - working from home, masks on public transport and Covid passes for nightclubs - will end over the next week. He added: “There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether - just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. “As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. “The self-isolation regulations expire on March , at which point I very much expect not to renew them. “Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Reuters AGThe TimesPlan BBoris JohnsonPublic transportFluPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son. If anyone has a chance of building bridges with Prince Harry, it’s his father.

A group of  Tory MPs elected in  met last night to discuss how they were going to oust the PM. According to swirling rumours, they were planning to all send letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  committee, expressing their lack of confidence in Mr Johnson. Still thereaposs no word of how many,any of them, have gone through with the plan. But that didnapost stop the PM calling them up, according to reports.  Mr Johnson is said to have cried as he begged for the group of  Tories to support him as he battles for his political le. When askedthe PM was in tears as he met the MPs, the PMaposs press secretary said: Iaposve seen that report, itaposs not true. The PMaposs Secretary admitted she was not there when they spoke. But she added a second time, itaposs not true.Christian Wakeford, who defected from the Conservative party to Labour this afternoon, was a Tory  MP who had been expressing his anger over the PMaposs handling of partygate for some time.Mr Wakeford was cheered by the Labour party as he sat on their benches. But Tories hissed and cried shocking at the same time.The gathering got its pork nickname as Alicia Kearns MP for Rutland and Melton hosted the gathering - Melton is the town best known for its pork pies. Mr Wakeford was one of seven Tory MPs had publicly called for Johnsonaposs resignation. In a historic letter to Mr Johnson he said the Tories are incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves.

Moments after he pledged to win the next election, the Prime Minister said certain measures will come to an end from Thursday. His announcement comes as part of the latest move from Downing Streetaposs aposOperation Red Meatapos - a number of measures rolled out to win back Tory support. The PM has been accused of removing public health protections in the hope of saving his own skin.Dr Saleyha Ahsan, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: Whilst the Prime Minister removes public health protections in the hope of saving his own skin,  families have tragically lost loved ones to Covid in the last  hours. He isn’t prioritising saving lives and, evenhe was, no one would take him seriously. How can anyone think that this is how le or death decisions should be made But Mr Johnson outlined his plans to start treating Covid like the flu.He told the Commons: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu.“As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. So what Covid restrictions are coming to an end  Mandatory Face masksFrom next Thursday, people in England will not need to wear face masks anywhere.Tomorrow, January , secondary school pupils will no longer need wear them in classrooms. Instead, the Government will recommend people wear face coverings in enclosed or private spaces. But it will ultimately be their choice.Mr Johnson told the Commons: In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces, particularly when you come into contact with people you donapost normally meet, but we will trust the judgement of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one.Teaching unions have said the move is premature.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teachersapos union said: No-one wants face masks for any longer than they have to be on... but I think this is premature - pupils have been back two weeks... and back in full-time education for about  days. Working from home guidanceWorking from home guidance has been dropped as of midday.People have been encouraged to work from homethey could since December .But it was guidance, which means it wasnapost legally binding. But the Government began to encourage it as a means of getting Covid cases down.Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. In an apparent bid to please many Tories who had been calling for aposfreedomapos Mr Johnson said people will be free to commute into work and into busy offices once again. Covid vaccine passesMandatory Covid passes will end next week Thursday just as all restrictions expire on January . Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test.

Angry Red Wall MPs have been heaping pressure on the Prime Minister as Westminster buzzes with rumours over how many letters of no confidence have gone into the Tory backbench  Committee. Only  chairman Sir Graham Brady knows the true number but tensions are running high as Boris Johnson tries to win over his mutinous MPs. Six senior Tories have openly called for Mr Johnson to quit but reports of a Red Wall rebellion are adding to the PMaposs woes. Dubbed the pork pie plot as a meeting was hosted by the Melton MP Alicia Kearns, it underlines the level of anger among some of the  intake.And Bury South MP Christian Wakeford dramatically abandoned the Tories for the Labour Party on Wednesday. Here we look the new rebels making le dficult for Boris Johnson. What is a aposRed Wallapos Tory MP  The term loosely refers to the Conservatives who won their seats off Labour during Boris Johnsonaposs  election landslide. The Red Wall is a nickname for Labouraposs traditional heartlands in England and Wales, particularly seats in the North of England, North Wales and the Midlands . A swathe of these seats turned Tory in , including Tony Blairaposs old seat of Sedgefield, in Co Durham, Blyth Valley in Northumberland and Workington in Cumbria. These MPs were perceived as loyal to Boris Johnson but discontent has been mounting over broken promises on levelling up and rail reform. Partygate has also landed badly with voters, and some of these new MPs may be feeling vulnerable going into the next election. Who are the Pork Pie plotters  Alicia Kearns The former Foreign Office official has been outspoken about the UK’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the handling of the crisis by senior civil servants. Ms Kearns, , MP for Rutland and Melton has hosted meetings of anti-Johnson plotters - leading to the plan being named after Melton Mowbray’s most famous export. Her , majority in the safe blue East Midlands seat allows her the luxury of plotting.  Dehenna Davison The PM’s then girlfriend and now we Carrie was pictured campaigning with Ms Davison in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham in the run-up to the  ballot. The -year-oldaposs stunning victory was the first time the Tories had won the seat in nearly  years. The arch Brexiteer presents a GB News show with ex-UKIP chief Nigel Farage.  Gary Sambrook The Birmingham Northfield MP is a Covid passport rebel and said the PM must consider his positionhe is found to have broken lockdown laws. As secretary of the  Committee, Mr Sambrook, , would be one of the MPs responsible for running a no-confidence vote and subsequent leadership race. Chris Loder The former train guard, , worked his way up through the industry to become head of new trains for South Western Railway. His majority of , in the Conservative stronghold of West Dorset should make him electorally immune to fury at the PM and Partygate. Christian WakefordThe Bury South MP didnapost attend the meeting but he became the first Red Wall Tory to say publicly that he had submitted a latter of no confidence.Within  hours he had defected to Labour, dramatically joining the party for Prime Ministeraposs Questions on Wednesday.In an excoriating letter to Boris Johnson, he said: Britain needs a Government focused on tackling the cost-of-living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a Government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and Government this country deserves.He added: My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided.

Iaposm sorry that my conduct will have had a further harmful effect on the complainants and that it may have diminished public confidence in the process. A Parliament probe last June found he had acted in a “threatening and intimidating manner” towards workers after a tech glitch meant he was unable to join a committee hearing. An Independent Expert Panelreport published in June, found Mr Kawczynski had been repeatedly aggressive, rude and impatient in calls made to the private mobile phone of one of the complainants.

Labour leader Keir Starmer said: I would like to welcome Christian Wakeford to the Labour Party. He has always put the people of Bury South first. In the town of Prestwich, which sits in the Bury South constituency, there was a mixed response today to Christian Wakeford’s defection from Tory to Labour. Sham Raja, , said: “It’s so shameful. He signed up to be a Conservative MP. It’s disgraceful, he was elected under the Conservative banner.“There are lots of small businesses struggling at the moment and he’s said nothing about this. Boris Johnson was the only guy to bring us out of Europe and get Brexit done.“I think he should step down as an MP andhe wants to be a Labour MP, he should apply to be one. “He’s not won on a Labour  and he should take it upon himself to step down.” Jeremy Burtles, , said: “There should be another election – you can’t just switch. If you want to change parties, you need to step down. “You always vote for the party you want in charge so I think it’s ridiculous to switch all of a sudden. “If you’re going to change your view, you should just step down.” And Hazel Donnelly, , said: “I don’t think it was very good at all, he shouldn’t be allowed to do that.  “It won’t change the way I vote because I am a Conservative. “I don’t think it’s a big deal what Boris did - there are much worse things that have happened recently. “There should be certain rules with these things. I think he has broken a rule but there are more important things going on at the moment.” But Barry Humphries, , backed the MPaposs decision. He said: “Good for him, I think he’s doing what’s right for him and he’s standing up for what he believes in.” And Ifkan Ahmed, , added: “I’ve always been happy with him. I think these days it’s okay to change your policies. “He has been very good for our area and I’m happy with what he’s done. It doesn’t matter to me that he has changed.”  Vickie Stone, , said: “If he wants to do it because of Boris Johnson then I think that’s fair enough. “If he doesn’t agree with the way Boris is handling the situation then that’s up to him. “I’m more bothered about the leadership, I’m worried about who is going to replace Borisit ends up going that way.” In Radclfe, the centre of the constituency, the MPaposs office, painted in true-blue Tory colours, was shuttered. Outside on the street, ex-Labour and current Tory voter Mavis Leach said: Well, Iaposm surprised. Are there others doing it, as well, getting out of a sinking ship before it goes down  Mrs Leach, who said she disavowed Labour because of a dislike for former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said Boris Johnson should stay on as Prime Minister.I know heaposs done wrong, done a lot of things wrong, she said. Boris has done a lot of things. We know that. But I think heaposs done a good job in other things,bringing the vaccinations in, and weaposre in a good place for that. Another local, Jonathan Boston, a Labour supporter, said Mr Wakefordaposs change in loyalty is really good news. Presumably, itaposs all to do with partygate, he said, referring to allegations of lockdown-busting parties within No , though a Labour spokesman has since said talks with Mr Wakeford began before the scandal hit. Mr Boston said: From what one hears, all the MPs have had millions of emails from constituents saying, aposItaposs terrible and heaposs got to go,apos so I donapost think any Tory voter, even in Radclfe, or Bury South or whatever, would be surprised at .probably the first of many, I would have thought, especially the newer MPs. I think a lot of the newer ones will do a similar thing. Meanwhile, Chris Holland said he rated Mr Wakeford as a local MP but had not voted for him. He said: Iaposve never voted Tory and I never would do. Iaposve messaged him a few times and he has got back to me. To me, heaposs not been doing too bad. Iaposd rather have a Labourthan a Tory. David Collins, who runs Marieaposs Coffee Shop, a stoneaposs throw from Mr Wakefordaposs constituency office, said: I probably wouldnapost vote for either of them anyway, Labour or Conservative. Theyaposre all as bad as each other. They all promise theyaposre going to do things and none of it ever materialises, does it  You wouldnapost think you were able to jump ship halfway through, would you   Tory voter Joan Humphreys said she feels like her tick at the ballot box has now been wasted. She said: I feel like going down there and saying, aposRight. I want to withdraw it.apos If he wants to become Labour, and he wants to support Labouraposs policies, we should have a by-election and see what the people say.

Josh Wood, , was in his early twenties when he first downloaded Tinder and reckons he was one of its earliest users. Even being invited to the dating app’s launch party, Josh, originally from Surrey but now living in London, had high hopes for Tinder. But as the years went by and more dating apps like Hinge and Bumble crowded the field, Josh found himself with lots of potential interest - but very few real-le dates. Overall, Josh reckons he had  matches across dating apps in the years he was using them, but he was frustrated when hardly any of them led to dates.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “When I moved to London I continued to use dating apps for about a year. I’d tried them all but always had the same frustrations that girls didn’t reply,” Josh told The Mirror. He explained he thinks there are pros and cons to how apps have changed the dating scene. “I think they have obviously made it a lot easier to date and opened you up to a lot of new people. You can connect with someone so easily and there are so many success stories,” he explained. But he added: “People have a lot more choice and it makes people picky. They’re just looking for that absolutely perfect person because they can swipe through , people.” After giving up on the apps for good, Josh knuckled down at work and pushed the idea of finding love aside for about three years.But one day, while watching the Champions League final at a bar in Cha, Josh saw a woman who caught his attention - and decided to introduce himself the old fashioned way. The woman he said hello to was called Lisa - and the pair are now in a happy relationship. While Josh’s love le had picked up, he had also been busy with work, developing an app of his own. Bloc, which has now been operating for five years, is a social events app - that can lead to a datepeople want. Populated with every public venue in the world including arenas, stadiums, restaurants and bars, users of the app can ‘check in’ at the venue and then ‘swipe’ on other people who have also checked in there. “Although the idea of Bloc was sparked from dating apps, we didn’t want it to be a dating app,” Josh said. “We mainly reward people for checking in and attending venues. The byproduct of that is you can see all the other people who have checked in there.” Every time a user checks in using Bloc, they are gted the app’s currency, which they can then spend on the app’s store. “The biggest problem we’re solving is that you’re very likely to meet that person in that venueyou’ve connected with each other, whether you want to date them or not,” he said. Josh added the app had a “rollercoaster couple of years” when the pandemic hit and no one was checking into any venues at all. But since lockdowns have eased and le has tentatively ed to normal, the app’s activity is increasing - and it now has , users. Another issue that Josh hopes his app has tackled is safety - particularly for women. Every user goes through a verication check when they first sign up, and the team is working on adding more layers of security. He said: “The big dference is when someone meets a person on Tinder or Bumble, they go to meet them alone. “With Bloc, it’s about checking into a venue like a bar, which you’ll usually go to with your friends. “Maybe a boy and a girl would match on the app and the boy would ask the girl and her friends to hang out with him and his friends. “It’s usually in a group so there’s safety in numbers.”How did you meet the love of your le  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcWhile most of the app’s users are based in the UK, it allows you to check into venues around the world - and Josh wants to expand in the near future.

Alice said the lack of expertise led to some hurtful and unhelpful comments about her weight not being low enough and her generally not being poorly enough. That was really dficult for my parents to hear, she continued. Just as they were getting somewhere they were met with another barrier.  Eventually, Alice was able to find more suited professionals - but said the support in Wales is rather limited. When I did ask for help it often felt like I wasnapost heard which then made my eating disorder worse, she said. At first, she was pointed to a community mental health team involving support workers, psychologists and dieticians, but was too high risk and unwilling to engage with them. When she became more entrenched in her illness, Alice ended up having two inpatient admissions - one to a general medical ward and another to a mental health unit. She said such settings are not appropriate for eating disorder patients and place additional demands on staff there who arenapost trained to deal with such conditions. Aliceaposs le changed for the better when she was admitted to a specialist eating disorder unit in England where appropriately trained staff enabled her to make steps towards recovery. Despite being grateful for the help outside Wales, she said moving away was dficult during such a vulnerable time and believes her home country must look at providing similar specialised units. Fully recovered, Alice is now a second-year psychology student at the University of South Wales. I have now reframed my experience as it has shaped me in many wonderful ways, she said. The student now volunteers for the eating disorder charity Beat as an ambassador to promote awareness through my experience, but also as peer support for those currently struggling. Beat has published a new report this week which looks at the progress made since a review was submitted to the Welsh Government in . It found that while some progress has been made to expand and improve services for the , people in Wales with an eating disorder, this progress has been very uneven. Beataposs national officer for Wales, Jo Whitfield, said: We know that accessing the right treatment quickly leads to the best chance of making a full recovery, and it is encouraging to see that some progress has been made.Implementing our recommendations would enable the Welsh Government and NHS Wales to transform these services across the whole nation, ensuring that everyone affected in Wales can access le-changing support quickly.In response to the report, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said: We have continued to invest in eating disorder services and since , health boards have received an additional £.m to support improvements, in line with the  Eating Disorder Review.

The average night saw the -year-old sink up to eight cans of beer, as well as deep-fried chicken, pizza or Chinese takeaway. He said his beer belly got so out of hand it would dig into his belt when he fastened his shoelaces. During the second lockdown, Matthew realised he wasn’t happy with his weight and decided to do something about it. Despite having no experience in a gym, he signed up to Ultimate Performance Personal Trainers Leeds after walking past one day. He has since lost kg and achieved his goal of getting a body like the one Hollywood star Chris Pratt sported in Jurassic World. Matthew said: “It was a depressing time for everyone. The second lockdown affected my mental health. “I wasn’t enjoying my job, my weight wasn’t right. I ended up leaving my job and getting into fitness, things started to get better. It was hard at the time. “I was struggling to commit to a run by myself then decided it was time to join a gym. Being a tight Yorkshireman I wanted to get my money’s worth.” Prior to lockdown, Matthew would get up to , steps in a day, however, this plummeted to around , steps mainly from walking his dog.  After joining the gym and having a personal trainer, he was taught how to use the equipment properly and would do three one hour workouts each week, and he increased his steps to , a day. After  sessions in  weeks, he dropped all the weight and said he “feels a million times better”.His blood pressure has come down and he is now much more body confident and happy as a person, he added.Matthew describes what a typical day was like for him before he started his fitness journey A day in the le of me, on a workday – say itaposs Monday itaposs wake up, maybe I have some Pop-Tarts, so just sugary carbs, Iaposd have a coffee, probably three or four coffees in the morning. Breakfast, a couple of sausages, just on the fly with some hash browns. Again, just dirty food. ThatapossI had time to eat it. Lunchtime, again, we had a lot of naughty-type food, like deep-fried chicken and things like that, which would be on the menu. So deep-fried chicken, evenI had it as a salad. Itaposs just loads of hot sauce, and I didnapost realise the number of calories in hot sauce – just the worst ones with so much sugar in them. Get home, and then for tea, it might be a take-away pizza or Chinese. On average, Iaposd probably be having anywhere between four to eight cans of full-fat beer a night, not like Bud Light or Budweiser. Just every night Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday were even bigger blowouts. I wouldnapost even realise it because, throughout lockdown, it just became a norm to have constant drinks. When I came back into work, I was like, Oh, itaposs Monday. Yeah, we always have a drink on a Monday. So my mentality was, Letaposs have a couple of beers. The next thing you know, I would have about , calories in beer a day, on top of all the dirty foods. Iaposd be well into the , or , calorie mark, and each day it was just increasing and increasing. It affected me mentally and physically.

Attorney Lisa Bloom said: “She is willing to do the deposition Virginia Giuffre’s team is seeking. “I am proud to represent Shukri Walker, who has bravely stepped forward as a witness and encourages others who may have information to do so as well.” Walker has previously told the FBI she definitively remembered seeing Andrew in March  inside London’s Tramp nightclub.  She said it was “seared” into her memory because she had apologised to the Prince, now , after stepping on his foot while dancing. Walker previously said: “Andrew looked like he was having a great time. “He was with this young girl who was close to my own age, perhaps even a bit younger than me… I will never forget the night because I was told this is a real prince. Giuffre claims that at age  she was forced into having sex with the prince, by the royal’s pals, sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, on three occasions. She alleges the first time was in London at Maxwell’s home. Before having sex Giuffre says they had gone for a Chinese meal before heading to Tramp.  The -year-old is suing the Duke for sexual abuse in a civil lawsuit filed in New York. Andrew emphatically denies all allegations of misconduct.It comes as journalist Annette Witheridge said in ITV documentary Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile she said she saw the Duke’s Royal Protection squad outside Epstein’s home in .She said: As I got nearer Jeffery Epsteinaposs place there were ious gentlemen in suits outside talking into their cuff links with English accents. [I said to myself] aposThataposs it these are Andrew’s people - the Royal Protection squadapos.

Tom - real name Bokejon Akram - was a Russian soldier and school teacher taken as a POW by the Third Reich. They took him to the occupied Channel Island of Jersey as a slave but he managed to escape and was taken in by Phyliss and John. They risked their lives by hiding him in their house where he had trap door escape routes.Have your say on this story in the comment section He told their five young kids fairy stories and even kept a diary - just like the teenage Anne Frank in Amsterdam. The family called him aposTomapos and taught him English – partly by reading the Bible with him. He survived with them for three years and was repatriated to the Ukraine in  by the British. They lost touch after the war and the familyaposs story has now emerged as officials at Jersey Heritage try to discover more about him. Phyliss and Emilyaposs grand-daughter Carolyn Horn, , said she was immensely proud of what her family risked to save Tomaposs le. Carolyn, who lives in Cyprus with her husband and three children, said: He became a member of the family. aposaposMy aunt said she called him her favourite uncle, as that was how he was known - Uncle Tom. My grandmother used to talk about Tom all the time. It just shows what kind people they were. It makes me proud.  It was a time of crisis and they had German soldiers walking in whenever. aposaposThey still risked their own lives, and the lives of their children, to help someone who they didnapost even know and let live in their house as a member of their family. There was a little door under the staircase in the house with a trap door behind it - that is how Tom could get from one side of the house to the other.aposapos Phyliss and John are reported to have said: We trusted this man, he was the sort of man we could trust. The children loved him and, when he could understand some English, he used to read them fairy stories. Tomaposs journey began in July  when the young Ukrainian soldier and unmarried school teacher defended his country against German attack. During a two hour period , of his colleagues died and Tom alongside many other Ukrainians became a PoW. The German soldiers collected thousands of people and used them as slave labourers to quarry stone and build coastal defences.  Tom then found himself with , others taken to St Malo in Jersey in July . He was put into hard labour but managed to run away and was found in St Mary - by Phyliss, John, and their four very young children. They were nervous and so renamed Bokejon as Tom to reduce the risk of discoverytheir kids said anything.  Tom slept in in the stables behind a trap door, in a car hidden behind bales of straw and in a shed in case the Germans called. Phylissaposs daughter Dulcie, now in her s, remembers him reading fairy stories to the children and playing with them. Dulcie, who was four when the Occupation began, remembers Tom like a favourite uncle. In May , before repatriation to the Ukraine by British forces, Tom promised to keep in contact.  Three letters arrived in June  from Guernsey where Tom was last known to be - but then nothing. Years later John was one of  Jersey men and women awarded a gold watch by the Soviet government for their courage in helping to shelter Russian and Ukrainian escapees. Historians at Jersey Heritage have now issued a plea for anyone to come forward with more information about him. Chris Addy, sites curator, said they were surprised how much they had been able to find out about them.He said: It’s always a bit of a guess. You never know what stories are going to come out after  years.It’s always fascinating to hear a new piece of information or research, and add it to the stories that we tell each year to remind people about this signicant part of the Island’s history.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Uncle TomAnne FrankEducationSoldiersNazis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

James, , from Walsall, West Midlands, believes he contracted coronavirus during a night out in Birmingham and was left in a -day coma as a result of the virus. The fitness fanatic suffered headaches, loss of appetite and light-headedness before recording a positive lateral flow test. His condition quickly deteriorated, reports Birmingham Live. “I was sweating and I couldn’t stand up properly,” said James. “As I was going home my throat was tight and I was struggling to breathe, so I called .” At Walsall Manor Hospital, James was told there was a long wait for admission and decided to go home before ing the next morning.  Two more trips to AE followed after James suffered hallucinations. He was still feeling unwell and light-headed, and the second time, he passed out. James added: “I was having nightmares, and the next thing I knew, I was in ICU. “They told me I had a lack of oxygen to the brain and at one stage I was told I had died and they had to resuscitate me. He was placed in an induced coma for  days and spent more than a month in hospital before eventually getting on the road to recovery. But then he was dealt another Covid-related blow. Recalling the horrying experience, he said: “A doctor asked, ‘can you walk ’ So I tried but I collapsed like a newborn donkey. “I really struggled to talk too because I was so out of breath.”  After  days in the hospital, he has become so weak that he now needs carers to support his everyday needs. Reflecting on being so scared at what happened to him, he had no hesitation in getting the vaccine after also being encouraged to do so by family members.“I am fit, healthy and as fit as a fiddle and I caught Covid- with no underlying health problems whatsoever,” he said.“Having Covid- is no joke and it’s not going anywhere. The reason I had the vaccine was to lessen my anxiety because I’ve just been in ICU and I really don’t want to go into hospital again. “Anyone who doesn’t have the vaccine is an idiot. Having some help to protect you is better than having no help –you just rely on your body to fight it, it’s not enough.” James now encourages friends to follow suit. “Some of my mates who know my situation now take it more seriously and have now been vaccinated,” he added. “I text them saying ‘make sure you do’. I was lucky – I came out of it the other side. Normally I am someone who thinks they can just sleep these things off but I am a transformed person and I’m glad I listened to my family. “As someone from the Afro-Caribbean community, I would urge everyone to forget any stubbornness about it because that won’t keep you alive.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsFitnessCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Taking their seats, Kate, , who arrived in a smart navy coat and a black polo neck for the engagement in central London, asked the experts: From your experience what makes the dference between a young person succeeding after leaving foster care and when they do not. They heard about challenges for young people when they regularly move home and are sometimes exploited by the criminal world. William added: If you keep moving a child around when they are an adult their relationships are so short and shallow. Kate said she was concerned that without providing stable homes for children they risk being moved around and having to tell their story again and again. Will said: That may become emotionally exhausting to tell the story again and again. Weaposve had that in the mental health side of things, people end up on the street, go through hoops and hurdles, tell so many people in authority and nothing changes. You have to get to them a lot earlier so they donapost have to keep doing this. Later as they left the event William, , could not avoid the drama of his own family as a TV crew asked the Duke do you support Prince Andrew  as the couple left the museum. The Duke leaned closer to hear but then walked past without commenting. Part of their engagement, handpicked by the couple to be their first event of the year, saw them discuss the worry about the consistency in care:  Olympic hero runner Kris Akabusi, poet Lemn Sissay, and Allan Jenkins, editor of Observer Food Monthly, told the Duke and Duchess their experiences of growing up in care. Akabusi said: I enjoyed the stability. It was a saviour for me. He said leaving care aged -years-old was very traumatic. Kate replied: You are petried leaving for independence. She asked the m hurdlerit had affected his relationships. Kris, with his distinctive laugh, replied: Yes, but I am a loner. He added: Now aged  there is no stigma attached when I say I was brought up in care but there was a stigma when I was . Women who had previously been in care then joined the couple in an aposice-breakerapos armed with three-foot long pencils. They drew on a canvas what they could see in front of them without looking down at the floor. Kate - who scored a master of arts degree in art history at St Andrews University - laughed out as she struggled with the artwork which had the look of a vast doodle when it was finished. Duke laughed and said: I enjoyed it. The kids would really enjoy that. Viewing their masterpiece, he added: Thataposs beautul. Athlete Kris Akabusi said afterwards: It is great to have so many vital resources for young people. As a young person in care, to know people at the top are interested in your story and growth as an adult is very encouraging. Hopefully they are not forgotten. Young people who were in care are over-represented in gangs, sex industry and crime, I hope society has not forgotten them as these children are in care throigh no fault of their ownnso it is great to have this infrastructure. The Foundling Museum tells the history of the Foundling Hospital, the UK’s first children’s charity. It was founded in  as a home for children whose mothers couldn’t keep or care for them. The Museum delivers training, mentorship programmes and creative projects, led and developed by contemporary artists, writers and musicians, to continue to use creative action to transform and improve the lives of care-experienced young people. It helps around  adults who grew up in care every year. The Tracing Our Tales is described as a unique programme which has been developed to equip care-experienced young adults from London boroughs with the skills to devise and deliver workshops at the Museum for family groups. The programme provides paid employment and valuable le skills, including public speaking, critical and creative thinking, and people management, as well as skills in art and creative expression.

After being given a good clean, the cat looks unrecognisable and has found a new familyScruffy was covered in grime but has now been given a makeover Image: Newcastle Dog  Cat ShelterByStephen WhiteNews Reporter:,  Jan | comments A kitten called Scruffy has been given a makeover to get a new owner after he was found as a stowaway in a rubbish truck.A heartbreaking snap shows the grime-covered kitty when it was handed in at an animal shelter. But Scruffy got lucky after being given a good clean and looks unrecognisable. And it has bagged Scruffy a new family. The black and white cat looks like a new animal after the makeover. A spokesman for Newcastle Cat and Dog Sanctuary said: “We first met Scruffy after he decided to take a ride in a refuse truck. “Luckily the driver spotted his little stowaway and brought him to us.  “And you can see why we gave him the name Scruffy.” They added: “Scruffy is now living a pampered le with his new family after being adopted in December. “Thank you so much to Lisa and family for turning this little scruff into a pampered prince.” And animal-lovers had kittens after reading of Scruffy’s changed fortunes on social media.

Manubi’s overlay text on the video, reading “DoorDash food delivery girl is not getting a tip after THAT comment!!” makes it clear that he believes the delivery driver called out a rude comment, along with the TikTok caption: “I may have ordered a little too much but that comment was a little overboard” and the hashtag “youresofat”. However, the TikTok has since received .m views, , likes, along with thousands of comments - many of which are from people who believe all is not what it seems. Some claims in the comments section are from people who believe Manubi misheard the delivery and that she was saying something  entirely. One person wrote: “I heard ‘Your foods up.’” Another person said: “She said ‘It’s DoorDash…’ Karen.” Someone  replied: “Bro she said ‘foods outside.’ “She definitely didn’t say that, you can tell just from the way she says it that she was just telling you the food was outside,” a fourth person replied. Other more cynically-minded TikTokers accused Manubi of using the misinterpretation as an excuse to not pay the driver a tip.  “She said ‘It’s DoorDash’ you just want to be cheap,” one person said. While some viewers were against Manubi, others backed him and his claims. One person said: “I can definitely hear the pronounced F at the end for fat. There’s no way she said DoorDash or anything . It doesn’t even sound similar.” “It’s pretty clear, she said it,” another person wrote. Someone  added: “LMAO BRO SHE LITERALLY SAID IT ARE U GUYS DEAF.” A portion of viewers sat on the fence, or were simply confused. “What did she say ” one asked. Another person wrote: “At first I heard ‘ur foods up’ but I watched it again and heard “ur so fat”. Reading the comments, it appears there is no conclusive answer.

Similarly, his Instagram page, which has a blue veried tick and is followed by the official Royal Family account, has been made private, while the profile picture and some information has also disappeared from his Facebook page.A source told MailOnline that Andrewaposs social media channels were in the process of being removed but some were taking longer to filter through.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. At every turn the Queen has handled Harry’s behaviour with good grace, wishing him well and extending a loving sentiment that he and his family would always be much loved members of her own.

The announcement that Plan B measures, which mandated people wearing masks and working from home where possible, will be lted on January  comes as welcome news to many.Because of the still-high numbers, the likelihood of fewer masks, and public places and transport getting a little busier in the coming weeks, it is important to know what to look out for.It is also important for the millions who have been vaccinated to be familiar with Covid symptoms and be able to recognise how they may dfer from symptoms among the unvaccinated. An array of studies has found that Omicron is, on the whole, a milder iant of the virus, with the first official UK report finding that it is between  and % less likely to cause hospitalisation than Delta.Despite this, getting your booster jab remains the best way to protect yourself and those around you from the virus. What symptoms should people look out forthey are vaccinated   Although its findings are not peer-reviewed, the ZOE Covid app study is a useful indicator that pools together the symptoms experienced by people who have tested positive for the virus.Data collected by it has found there are nine symptoms that keep cropping up. Professor Tim Spector, who is one of the key figures behind the project told newsGP : The  million reports submitted via the study’s app have shown that as the virus has evolved, so too have the symptoms it causes. Back in , it quickly became clear that the original and Alpha versions of the coronavirus caused three very common symptoms – cough, fever and loss of smell – as well as at least  others. When Delta appeared, we then noticed a sht in the most frequently reported symptoms. Cold-like symptoms – including a runny nose, sore throat and persistent sneezing – became more common, along with a headache and cough, particularly in people who had been vaccinated. He added: It’s causing symptoms that are much more like a regular cold, particularly in people who’ve been vaccinated, and fewer general systemic symptoms, such as nausea, muscle pains, diarrhoea and skin rashes. This means the nine common symptoms among the vaccinated according to respondents who have added their data to the ZOE Covid app are:Runny noseSore throatSneezing Headache Cough Nausea Muscle painsDiarrhoeaSkin rashThese are of course not necessarily the only things to keep an eye out for but are handy to know aboutyou find yourself developing any of these symptoms.

But theyaposve had several homes together since they first started dating almost six years ago. After they became engaged, Meghan moved in to Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. But after their wedding, they wanted somewhere bigger to raise a family and went to the Queen with an idea. But according to a report the pair faced disappointment when the monarch rejected the request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.  The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate.

He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Before the birth of Archie, the couple moved into their Frogmore Cottage home, later than expected due to delays with renovation work. Itaposs just over two years since they moved out of Frogmore and started their new le in the US. But it has now emerged that Harry does not want to bring Meghan and their two children to the UK to visit, saying there is a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK.

I absolutely hate standing at check-outs.Bill is one of a flock of people who headed to Greenwich to try out Aldi Shop  Go, the budget supermarketaposs first cashless store, on its second day of opening.After a dficult start to his shop involving five dferent members of staff valiantly trying to download an app onto his phone, Bill got through the automatic gates and into the fruit and veg aisle. The retired BT worker appeared through the exit ten minutes later an advocate of the new system. I will definitely be coming back, he smiled. If Aldi can convert more octogenarians like Bill to the cashless shopping cause, then the German company is probably onto a winner. When it opened its flagship south London shop on Monday Aldi was following in the footsteps of Amazon Fresh.  The American retail giant stripped away much of the inbuilt faff of food shopping by ditching human and automated tills when it launched in London last year. Like its rival, Aldi asks shoppers to download and enter their card details into an app, which is then sent a rundown of how much theyaposve stuffed into their trolleys. Unlike Amazon Fresh - which monitors products via pressure pads on shelves - Aldi tracks who has grabbed what with a huge rig of  cameras that hangs from the ceiling. The storeaposs Articial Intelligence computer system then denotes each person a stick figure, so as not to log any identying characteristics and watches as the virtual you select items.  Aldi insists that the ultra-high-tech surveillance model means shoppers can pick up a product, place it in their bag and then put it back on a shelf without being charged. I put this claim to the test during my visit by selecting and then unselecting pineapples, bananas and melons multiple times while turning small circles with my wheelie-cart. Somehow the omniscient grocery gods knew only to add a banana to the receipt that dropped onto my phone half an hour later. Shoppers leaving the store agreed that the smart system sped up the supermarket experience considerably. Xanthe Williams, who lives in Greenwich and runs Fourth Day PR, said the shop had been fun and that she would come back.  Yasmine Aysha, a full-time mum-of-two from the area, managed to pile her buggy high with items in just fteen minutes - far quicker than her usual round. Like mum Kerry Palmer, from Greenwich, they also agreed that the experience would take a bit of getting used to. It was proper weird, she said.How do they know what you are picking up  Itaposs just really odd. It feels like you are shoplting without shoplting. Another small thrill that Aldi Shop  Go offers is the chance to be aged by its computer system. As soon as shoppers pick up an age-restricted product, such as a beer, paracetamol or four-pack of energy drinks, the AI machine triggers the age verication system. You must then show a staff member your ID or open the app and look deep into the camera. If the unforgiving binary eye that looks back decides you look over-, youaposre good to go. If youaposre lucky enough to look younger, staff will come and manually approve the purchase. It can only be a matter of time before a teenager with a head full of talcum powder, horn-rimmed glasses and a brown mackintosh attempts to game the system. When the novelty of the experience wears off, as one suspects it will after a few shops and failed attempts to trick the computer, it will be interesting to see how Aldi Shop  Go measures up to a typical supermarket.  For many people, a trip to the shops is a social activity that culminates in a chat with a cashier. Although there were many staff on hand to help customers navigate the new app, it has to be assumed that the final product will be much more streamlined. Some are wary of the impact this could have on the high street. Dr Jackie Mulligan, founder of local shopping  ShopAppy, warned: “Checkout-free stores are sterilising the high-street experience. Yes, they bring some advantages in terms of time savings, but they come at the cost of basic human interaction. “Technology is the future but people need to play a part in it, too. If Covid has taught us anything, it is the importance of social interaction.

And today the wise-beyond-her years tot performed a star turn on Sky News, where presenter Sarah-Jane Mee asked her what the Prime Minister did wrong. Smart Layla replied simply: He went to a party in lockdown.Layla for PM  Have your say in the comment section! Layla also confirmed she stuck to the rules herself during lockdown, and her fourth birthday party was held on Zoom. Sarah-Jane then askedLayla forgave the PM for the parties. The thoughtful girl replied yes and said it was because he gave everyone an injection on the arm, in reference to the vaccine program. However, when asked what should happen to Mr Johnson, little Layla didnapost mince her words when she declared: I think he should leave because he has been naughty. Parents Devina Somani, , and Nick Somani, , filmed the cutthroat monologue and were sat beside her today as she gave her blistering verdict. Her comments have left many online hailing her as the next PM. One wrote: Layla for Prime Minsiter! She doesnapost need luck, she knows the rules. Another wrote: Fantastic! Layla talks more sense than Boris. I’d vote for her to be the next Prime Minister.  A third chimed in: May God bless her, she speaks more sense than the grown-up politicians especially our PM.In last weekaposs video, which has been viewed thousands of times, Layla told her doting grandparents:Boris Johnson told everyone to stay at home, but in lockdown he just went down to a party, in the lockdown. Heaposs been naughty, so he had to go to the naughty centre to tell everyone heaposs sorry for going to a party in lockdown. She continued: Now he canapost be prime minister anymore and he canapost go back to his prime minister home, so heaposs not prime minister anymore. So, someone  is being prime minister and there will be a good prime minister, but Boris Johnson is not a prime minister anymore, heaposs a bad prime minister.Mr Johnson may be forgiven by Layla, but he still faces calls to quit after continuing allegations of rule-breaking parties in No and further accusations he has lied to Parliament.  Yesterday, he claimed nobody told me that a boozy lockdown bash in the Downing Street garden broke Covid rules. He broke cover for the first time in days to insist that he hadnapost lied to Parliament about the event in May , which he has admitted attending for  minutes. Last week, the PM admitted to MPs that he briefly attended a BYOB gathering in the No  garden on May   - but tried to claim he thought it was a work event.

Satellite data shows unusual atmospheric gravity waves since Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai’s eruption on Saturday which triggered massive ft tsunamis, devastating the island nation. The massive blast also created unusual gravity waves stretching around , kilometres, which have never been seen before, reports Nature. The data was collected by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounderon board a Nasa satellite orbiting the planet. Lars Hoffmann, an atmospheric scientist at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre in Germany, said: “It’s really unique. We have never seen anything like this in the data before.What do you make of the mystery ripples  Have your say in the comment section “This instrument has been operating for something like  years now and we have never seen such nice concentric wave patterns.” The pictures show dozens of concentric circles in the atmosphere which possibly cross the planet several times. Scott Osprey, from the University of Oxford, believes the eruption’s speed could possibly have caused the mystery waves.  One of the possible effects of the waves is the reversal of wind direction which could have an impact in Europe. He added: “This event seems to have been over in minutes, but it was explosive and it’s that impulse that is likely to kick off some strong gravity waves. “We’ll be looking very carefully at how that evolves.”  Hundreds of homes in Tongaaposs smaller outer islands are feared to have been destroyed in the tsunami, with at least three dead. Information on the scale of devastation has come mostly from reconnaissance aircraft as the nation’s airport is smothered by ash and communications have been hampered. Teams from The Red Cross say drinking water has been polluted by salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash. Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai has erupted regularly over the past few decades but the impact of Saturdayaposs blast was felt as far away as Japan and the United States. The eruption was also detected by volunteer meteorologists in Hastings, East Sussex.

She removed the burgeraposs signature two beef patties, along with pickles, shredded lettuce, onion, sesame bun and the iconic Big Mac sauce.

When the £. meal turned up at the door  minutes later, the prankster raced upstairs to hand her dad the box with just a slice of cheese inside. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I found it funny. It was my own fault for not checking it over first, Gaz said.

Heather, a communications and marketing manager, added: When Gaz dropped the girls off home Sunday night, itaposs a common theme that I ask them what theyaposve eaten with him so I donapost repeat the same meals.

God knows what the person at McDonaldaposs thought when they received the order.Heather uploaded photos of the meal onto Facebook, where it has racked up , likes so far.The post read: If you’re going to let your children add their own order on just eat, always check it before submitting it.

Facebook users were quick to see the funny side, with one writing: I can’t believe they would actually only send a piece of cheese tho they must have a right laugh sometimes [sic] Another added: They must’ve had a right laugh putting that together. What’s with the no sauce then extra sauce, wrote a third bemused user. Another said that, despite the lack of ingredients, the post still made them hungry, commenting: This made me laugh, want a Big Mac now though. I’m vegetarian and love cheese so this is perfect for me but oh no! added someone . Others felt sorry for Gaz, commenting: Most expensive slice of cheese heaposll ever buy.

Two-year-old Otis Morgan managed to get his hands on his dadaposs clippers when they were left on charge outside the bathroom while his mum Faith, , was folding laundry. And with his mumaposs back turned, cheeky Otis decided to switch on the clippers and go to own on his own hair, shaving half of his head and giving himself a unique trim. The toddler then crawled into his mumaposs bedroom, where Faith finally realised what had happened and began to laugh - becauseshe didnapost, she would have cried.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: I had to laugh. I mean you either choose to laugh or cry in situations like that. He was playing with his sisteraposs unicorn toy which makes a buzzing noise as it spins around, so I didnapost even register the buzzing noise of the clippers. Having seen his daddy shave his hair regularly he obviously decided to try them himself. He wandered back into my bedroom and I saw that he had hair on his sleeve. I honestly thought he had been hugging our cat and was surprised at how much he had been shedding. But it didnapost take me long to realise there was far too much hair for it to be the cat! Then I saw the damage he had done and asked him what had happened.  The mum admitted she did shed a few tears at the idea of having to shave her sonaposs locks completely off, and she later booked an appointment with a hairdresser to get the disastrous trim fixed. She added: I must admit I did cry later at the idea that we might have to shave all his hair off. Just because of how drastically dferent he would suddenly look! It isnapost too noticeable now and is something to make people smile. Heaposs a cheeky monkey so they are used to his antics! Faith also posted pictures of Otisapos unique look on a Facebook parenting group to ask for advice, as she really didnapost want to shave the totaposs hair. She wrote: So my husband left his hair clippers on charge and my yr old found them.  I know these things happenand I know it will grow back but has anyone had their child do something similar and have pictures of how you styled it to make it look Ok  I really donapost want to shave all his hair off.

She said: A lot of people thought it looked like he had a mullet and said he should keep it because it was making a comeback!

Here are some clever tips to keep in mind while playing the simple but addictive word gameWordle is the addictive word game taking over TwitterByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsEveryone seems to be playing Wordle, the viral puzzle game is a free, easy-to-access brain teaser that has quickly become the most trendy game around the world.The viral game, which can be played from any browser on any device, is simple and addictive, and lets you share your scores online as well. You may have seen these plastered all over the internet. While the game is quite easy to understand and play, it can get frustratingyouaposre only seeing grey squares with each guess you make. So, here are some tips to remember that will help you ace the game thataposs been trending on Twitter.What is Wordle   Wordle is a simple but tricky word puzzle which asks players to solve just one word puzzle per day. The word is always made up of five letters, that is the same for everyone who plays the game, and since thereaposs a new word every day you can make a habit of it and play it daily. The aim of the game is to guess the single word each time you play - you have six attempts to get it right. If you don’t get the word in six tries, you have to wait until the next day to try again with a new word. How does Wordle work   The addictive game uses a colour-coded system to give you a little hint which lets you knowa letter is in the right spot or not, with every guess you make. For example,you guess a word incorrectly, but one of the letters is right and in the correct position, that box turns green. If a letter in a word is correct but not in the right spot in your guess, then the box turns yellow. If none of the letters in your guess is the correct answer, the box turns grey. The game also lets you challenge yourself with a aposhard modeapos, which forces players to use hints given by the game, stopping you from guessing words at random. Since the word is the same for everyone, its quite fun to compare your guesses and scores with that of friends, family or even strangers playing online. Evenyou donapost get the answer right, the game still lets you share your scores online, which means you can have a laugh about the incorrect guesses youaposve made. Wordle Tips Luck goes a long way with Wordle, but some clever tips and tricks that make things a little easier to get started. Remember the following:Though the creator of the game, Josh Wardle is from UK, Wordle is based on American English Letters can, and often do, appear twice in words. Each word will appear only once, because Mr Wardle created the game using words his we recognised Use the same rules as Scrabble, like Qs need Us, and Zs are uncommon.Good starting words on Wordle are: NOTES RESIN TARES SENOROther frequently appearing letters that are good options to use in your second guess includes I,O,T,N and S.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EntertainmentLatest TrendBoxing DayNew YearPrince HarryRoyal FamilyViralBikinis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

To combat the cold, one woman on Reddit uses her caraposs auto-startto switch her engine on  minutes before she leaves the house - but her actions have been upsetting her new neighbours. Sharing her story anonymously, the woman - who is from the US - explained the auto-startautomatically switches on her caraposs headlights and said her neighbours have complained that the bright lights wake them up. She said: Iaposve lived in this same apartment building for  years. The apartment owners decided to add on to the parking lot around seven years ago, adding one row of parking between another building and mine. Iaposve been parking on this newer part because I can see my car from my living room sliding glass door. Plus it is within my caraposs auto-start range.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. I have a pretty strict morning routine, and at : during weekdays I autostart my car in the winter to warm it up. I always leave at :, unless there is a lot of snow to clear. But during those  minutes, my lights are on and point at either the apartments across from me or into the living rooms on my complex. The woman said she recently got into a confrontation with her neighbour about her lights after the man fell asleep in his living room and was rudely awoken by the bright beams. The woman agreed to turn her lights off when she parked up for the night so they wouldnapost turn on in the morning - but she forgot to do so and doesnapost think it should be that big of a deal.  She added: Yesterday when I got home from work, the new neighbours below me opened their sliding glass door and told me not to shine my lights into their apartment. I said, aposThataposs your living room, right  Iaposm always gone in  minutes, is it really that big of a deal apos The guy said that he fell asleep in his living room and I woke him up that morning, and he forgot to close his blinds. I apologised and said Iaposd try to remember to turn my lights off before I come home in the evening. Of course, I forgot, but this morning he had his blinds closed.  Am I really the a**hole here  Itaposs only for  minutes and itaposs not like Iaposm shining them directly into his bedroom. Iaposve never had this problem with anyone after living here so long. Commenters on the Reddit post were split, as many agreed that the woman was being inconsiderate by not taking her neighbouraposs needs into account. One person wrote: Itaposs only one second for you to turn your lights off and one second in the morning to turn them back on. It doesnapost matter that itaposs new neighbours. They complained. You can solve it. Iaposm sure you can afford to add one second to your strict morning routine. While another said: It’s pretty inconsiderate of you as a neighbour to shine that much light through their window. It takes minimal effort on your part to keep a neighbourly vibe. But others insisted the woman wasnapost purposefully trying to upset her neighbours, and instead suggested ways she could remember to turn her lights off in the future. Someone said: Stick a Post-it Note on your steering wheel to turn your lights off. Leave it there, so you remember to turn them back on in the morning. As someone  posted: This sounds like it happened one night only and then she said she would try to fix it. Most people don’t accidentally fall asleep in the living room so it’s the only time this guy had a problem. But I agreeit’s hard to remember to use notes to help.

He continued: You look like you hide cupcakes in your bedside table. Quizzing him further, she added: The f*** is that supposed to mean lmao.

Rachel told how the girl, who she estimates was aged between six and seven, came in with a headscarf on and showed her the infestation which was the worst Rachel had ever seen. The child was later taken to hospital and needed to have her head shaved. “She was very quiet and showed me how the lice were biting down her neck and back, since there was little to no space for them to crawl freely in her hair,” Rachel said. “Immediately when I saw her I knew something was wrong and that this would be the biggest case of lice I’ve had to face. “I’m used to extreme lice infestations but was definitely not prepared for what I saw. “I was told that the child had been dealing with the lice for several months and that treatments were being applied. “But my professional opinion is that this was an extended lice case where nothing was being done to combat it. The hairdresser said she could tell that the girlaposs hair had not been brushed in months and had tangled into a deep dreadlock matting that would have been impossible to treat with lice solution. This is sadly the result of child neglect,” she continued. It takes a very long time for lice to reach the point of severe infestation. It takes an even longer amount of time for hair to go that matted. In the video, which Rachel shared with her three million followers, the hairdresser films the child’s hair which can be seen crawling with lice. She said: “This poor child has obviously had lice for a very long time. Her hair has not been brushed in ages and has turned into one big ball of lice and knots, which meant that I called Child Protective Services right away.” Showing a clip of her usual method used on a previous client, Rachel wets the hair and applies a conditioning treatment before combing through the hair. Using glass, she “pops” the lice, pressing down to kill them. Sadly, this was not an option for the child and would have been too painful due to the matted condition of her hair. “In usual cases, it’s just a matter of combing through the hair section by section and popping the lice but I didn’t want to put a metal comb anywhere near this poor baby’s hair, Rachel said. “You can even see the lice were drinking blood out of her forehead. This broke my heart to see but I’m really glad she’s okay now.” The post went viral, racking up . million likes and being viewed  million times. One person commented: “Watching her wipe her tears made me have to do the same thing. I’m so sad for her but glad to hear she is safe.” Another user said: “I’m so so thankful that you stood up for her and protected her. Some users commented there was “no excuse” for the girl’s condition, while other people said their heads were itchy after watching the footage. After removing the lice infestation, Rachel updated her followers to explain the child had been picked up by CPS and was taken to hospital. “Although it was not the finished result anyone was hoping for, I know she feels a whole lot better with a fresh start so her scalp can start to heal, she said. Filming the hair for a follow-up post, Rachel explained the child’s hair had been detaching from the scalp. She says: “This left no space for the lice to move anywhere so they had to go on her hands and her neck to drink blood out of her body like that.” “Also there was a smell that leads me to believe there was some kind of mould in the matting here. “It’s very rare I see cases like this but it always breaks my heart.” Rachel also added that the stigma surrounding head lice is a big contributing factor to the spread of lice, as well as a “lack of education” and “embarrassment”.

Robin and Gavin were accidentally given to the wrong mothers by a nurse at Nigel Hospital in Johannesburg where they were the only two babies born on that day in February .This meant Robin was raised by single mum Sandy Dawkins who was struggling to get by on the outskirts of Johannesburg while Gavin grew up with wealthier parent Megs Clinton Parker in Pietermaritzburg. The mistaken was not uncovered until two years later when a disagreement over Gavinaposs rightful father led to a DNA test revealing that Megs was not his birth mother.  Hospital records further confirmed that Robin was Megsapos biological son who was growing up with Sandy as his mother. When faced with swapping their birth sons back, Megs and Sandy chose to keep the children they had raised since birth. Speaking nearer the time, one of the parents told  Minutes Australia: You canapost reject a child that youaposve been so close to for two years. Initially I think you protect the one youaposve got. The first few days are shock, then the curiosity comes. Whereaposs my baby   The boys grew up km apart in very dferent environments and referred to each other as brothers. But Robin has since admitted that he wishes his biological mother fought to switch him back. Speaking at age , he said he had dficulty accepting the situation and misses his mother Megs awfully a lot who he speaks to daily on the phone.  He told how le with Sandy was not easy and that he resented Gavin who does get things easy. If Iaposve ever wanted something, Iaposve had to work towards it. I’ve never just had it come towards me, he added. At the time, Gavin described being “happy” with the le he was accidentally given and that he did not feel sorry for Robin. He said: “Saying I thank my lucky stars every day would be wrong but at the same time I was given a le which I’ve now lived and I’m still living and I don’t regret anything.

The Daily Star says his unusual lestyle choices have made it it dficult to make friends or find a girlfriend.And one of his favourite past-times is smoking a pipe filled with animal manure which has left him more isolated. But he has impressed researchers who say he is perfectly healthy.Have your say on Amouaposs story in the comment section Villagers in Iran have been so impressed by his dedication to his unconventional lestyle, they built him a small shack as an alternative to his usual hole in the ground.Medics who visited the shack in the village of Dejgah, Iran carried out several tests and said that despite his lestyle, Jaji is surprisingly healthy and has no serious diseases or bacteria. Experts were interested in discovering dferent types of leforms, including parasites, might have taken up home on his body, but were able to confirm that he does not have any diseases or parasites despite his lack of hygiene. Professor Dr Gholamreza Molavi carried out the tests and suspects Jaji has remained healthy due to developing an enormously strong immune system.  Even with his preference for raw roadkill and a refusal to sterilise the water he drinks, Jaji has not suffered any diseases, leaving scientists surprised. The -year-old has also kept himself up to date with current events and discussed events like the Russian Revolution and French Revolution with those that visited him.  The newfound fame for the homeless pensioner has made le more dficult for him, he says, as although neighbours respect him, people occasionally show up to taunt him and throw stones. Medics tested him for everything from ious forms of hepatitis and AIDs through to parasites, and all they found was a symptomless infection of trichinosis.

Regrettably, the principle of development is not considered acceptable in this location.”.removeIt adds: “The planning authority understands the applicant’s circumstances and need to find alternative, fit for purpose family accommodation that meets their very specic needs. Unfortunately, their very specic personal circumstances are not material to the assessment of this application and cannot be taken into account when determining the acceptability, or otherwise, of the proposed development.”However, at the meeting Mr Moffat, of the SNP, moved a formal proposal to approve the plans which was seconded by Hawick representative Clair Ramage.He said: “The family want to stay in the community where they have got a support mechanism. It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances. In pure planning terms I’ve heard what has been said and normally you wouldn’t take certain things into consideration.“I don’t often disagree with the planning officers [but] I would quite happily approve this in principle because it’s the right thing to do.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scott-praises-efforts-departing-boss-hastings","story":"MARTIN ‘Jimmy’ Scott says he is \"honoured and excited\" to take over as manager of Gala Fairydean Rovers.The former Ross County and Hibs player joined Rovers last summer as assistant to Neil Hastings, who has left the club for a full-time position.Scott has appointed former Aberdeen player Steven Craig as his number two and he will join the club this week.Speaking following his appointment the new gaffer said: “I’m honoured and excited to be appointed manager of the club and I am really looking forward to getting started this week.“It will be a smooth transition for me, and this is credit to the players, staff and everyone who’s involved in the operation of the club.“I’ve worked very closely with Neil over the last six months and ultimately the philosophy will remain the same in how we want to approach the game although I will always keep putting the demands on the players to improve on the good work already done.“I have added Steven Craig to assist with first team operations and to attract someone of Stevie’s pedigree shows what a fantastic club we have here and he’s very excited to start working with myself, staff and the squad.“On a personal note, I’m absolutely delighted for Neil moving to a full-time position in football. He certainly deserves that opportunity and I have no doubt he will be a huge success.“Anyone associated with the club would agree this day would eventually arrive as he has a big future in coaching and management, and he certainly leaves Gala with everyone’s best wishes.”Neil Hastings took charge of the club back in  and made an immediate impact with his professionalism, ambition and passion.He led the Fairydean Rovers to their highest league finish last season."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-fled-extremism-joins-peeblesshire-churches","story":"A MINISTER who fled extremism in Pakistan has been inducted at Peebles Parish Church.Reverend Aftab Gohar moved to the town earlier this month after joining from Abbotsgrange in Grangemouth.Originally from Peshawar in Pakistan, the -year-old, his we Samina and their two sons came to Scotland in  to escape the threat of terrorism.But in  the Gohar family suffered a tragedy when Aftabs -year-old mother, his niece, nephew and two uncles were killed when extremists targeted his home church in Peshawar.The attack was later claimed by two militant groups linked to the Taliban.At the time, Rev Gohar told the BBC that he forgave the suicide attackers, saying: \"It is wrong what these people did but I forgive them\".When the incident happened, Aftab was the minister at Abbotsgrange Parish Church.But after more than a decade in the Forth Valley, he says it is time for a change.He told us: \"After  years we wanted to move on and Peebles, with all its scenery and beauty, invited us to come here.\"We visited this town three or four times.\"Once on our wedding anniversary we came to Peebles and stayed here.\"We like the scenery and the town as a whole.\"Rev.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

the same time.Roads were closed in some areas due to debris from beaches and the sea washing onto the road, with some buildings suffering structural damage.The lead from many of the Ugadale Cottages at Machrihanish was blown off and Machrihanish Golf Club also received damage to the course caused by the sea washing seaweed and debris onto the course.Electricity was off for most of Tuesday for West Kintyre and a lot of damage was caused to properties at the Sound of Kintyre.The road outside the County Garage in Campbeltown was shut for most of Tuesday and boulders washed up onto the A at Tangy Beach causing the road to be shut temporarily as cars were struggling to get by.Four people were rescued from Davaar Island, near Campbeltown, on Monday afternoon after being trapped by the

the London Boat Show, which opened at Earls Court on Thursday, January .Taking local food to the show is part of a drive by two local enterprise companies to promote the wealth of fresh produce available all from Scotland#s west coast and help boost links between tourism and food and drink.Top Argyll chefs and others from farther afield will be preparing a range of mouth-watering dishes utilising the area#s products including oysters, venison, scallops and meat from Scotland#s only snail farm based in Tayinloan.In addition, there will be new products from the area including trout caviar, goat#s cheese and fortune cookies.Argyll and the Islands Enterprise, along with Lochaber Ltd, is staging up to seven cookery demonstrations a day at the -day show, which is expected to attract more than , people.A recipe booklet has been prepared and will be handed out to visitors to the Sail Scotland stand which features the AIE and Lochaber Limited #Feast of Nature# display.As well as demonstrations, visitors will be able to sample oysters at a specially-created oyster bar and a range of other foods.Speed cameras could be installed on Argyll roads in a bid to cut down on speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

However, since eToro is available through a desktop site and mobile app, this is one of the speediest and most user-friendly brokerage sites in the business. As for the benefits of using eToro compared with some of the other exchanges, there are some fairly obvious advantages.

There is a fairly standard process required to open an online investment account, and in terms of personal requirements, you must be over the legal investing age and be a resident of a crypto-supported country. Providing that you satisfy these criteria, you can set yourself up with a new trading account by running through the following:The Registration ProcessFirst thing’s first, you have to actually create your online account before you can invest in any cryptos at all. This is required at all exchange s, in accordance with FCA, ASIC, and FINRAregulations. So, once you’ve decided which exchange site you’d like to joinyou must create a fresh username and password for that site. Your username has to be unique, and the password must be strong so that it cannot be hacked into easily. From here, it’s time to supply the site with your personal details. In order for the site to very that you are legally allowed to trade crypto, you must provide your name, DOB, address, contact information, and title. Once these details have been shared, you can then set up any security questions that you wish to implement for your account. And finally, you must agree to the site’s terms and conditions before officially opening the account.  gtgtgt Register with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provide Verying Your DetailsOpening your account is just the first step in the process. Note that anyone could actually go ahead and open an account, but in order to enjoy unrestricted access to all products and services, your details must be veried. Some people assume that this is a complex and slow process, but we can assure you that this isn’t true. While you are signed in, you can head into your account profile where you should see a link to very your details. On that note, there are two things that the site needs to confirm - that you are resident in your stated country and that you are over the legal investing age.So, concerning ID verication, you are usually able to scan or upload a photo of either your driving license or passport. Since these documents have both your name and date of birth on them, this takes care of proving who you are. But in addition to this, you must then demonstrate that you are a legal resident, by proving your address. In order to do this, you can upload either a bank statement or utility bill, which usually needs to be a recent document .After you have submitted this information, your account should get veried within a few hours.Depositing FundsCrypto coins might be classied as digital assets, but your very first purchase of a crypto coin must be executed in fiat currency.

After all, anyone could shortlist a range of investment s and claim them to be the best. But that leaves users somewhat in the dark as they approach the decision as to where they invest. To avoid that, we’d like to highlight some key areas that you must look at before signing up with any exchange.User ExperiencePutting the actual range of products or cryptos aside for a moment, the user experience is often an overlooked area. When we say user experience, we mean how easy the  is to use, how well it has been designed, and whether it performs well in general. After all, you could sign up with the best crypto exchange in the world, butit is overly complex or dficult to use, your ultimate experience will not be satisfactory.Payment MethodsSome might also involve fees, which is why you must assess each of these things prior to processing a deposit or withdrawal.FeesFees can be charged by crypto exchanges for ious things. Of course, each of these fees takes money out of your account, and subsequently reduces the capital you have available for investing. In terms of what areas fees apply to, you could see fees for deposits, withdrawals, trades, and even for inactivity at some s. With that said, there are s out there that have all but eliminated fees for several of these areas. And the more you can reduce your fees, the more cash you’ll keep to invest.RegulationCrypto is a regulated market in many parts of the world, meaning that it is officially legal to buy and sell ious coins within certain borders. In this sense, you’ve not got much to worry about when it comes to the market as a whole. However, inidual coins certainly can fall victim to regulations in dferent countries around the world. Take XRP as a prime example - the Ripple project is still facing a legal battle against the SEC in the US, which has greatly impacted the price.Range of CryptosMuch like the range of payment methods discussed above, the more cryptos that a site has available, the better things are doing to be. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than identying a potentially great investment only to find that your chosen site doesn’t support it. But while an exchange might actually support your preferred crypto, you still need to identy what trading pairs are available for that specic coin.  gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt % of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerFinal ThoughtsWhen all is said and done, crypto exchanges are safe and reputable s that can be used to buy and sell ious crypto coins.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years.

I am so proud of myself, women’s football and I am proud for my wee village of Stewarton.”The -year-old attracted the interest of scouts at Celtic when she started playing as a child, and was allowed to take part provided she cut her hair short and called herself Ross.She then went on to play for Reims as a teenager, and later joined ACF Milan, and was a member of the victorious Italian national side which won the Mundialito, the precursor to the women’s World Cup, in .“This recognition is good for the future players, the wee girls, that they can see that they can achieve something as a woman footballer in Scotland,” she added.“I can sit back on my laurels now.”When asked about how her conversation with Princess Anne went, she replied: “I said ‘Your Royal Highness, it’s a pleasure to get my MBE off a fellow sportswoman’. vw,vw,px, px\"Former footballer Rose Reilly received an MBE “She said, ‘I was interested, Rose, how come you played for Italy ’ And I said because I was banned from playing for Scotland, Scotland didn’t want me, but the Italians did, and she said ‘how amazing’.”Elsewhere, Brigadier Clare Phillips, colonel of career management operations at the Army’s Personnel Centre and co-chairwoman of the Army LGBT+ Network, was made a CBE.When asked about meeting Princess Anne, the former Royal Electrical and Mechanical EngineersCorps colonel said she felt “incredibly honoured”.She added: “I’ve been practising my curtsy, which is not something that I have regularly had to do in the past.“The Princess Royal was incredibly kind and she remembered that I am part of the REME, and that we recently rehomed the Corps to what was RAF Lyneham and which is now MoD Lyneham.“I was able to remind her that her father, his Royal Highness Prince Philip, opened the barracks just about five years ago, and it’s a superb new home for us, which was part of the reason that I’m privileged to have been given this award.”Brig Phillips, who joined the Army in , a time when she could have been discharged for being gay, was accompanied by her we Nicky, who has served in the police for  years.“Had I been able to bring more guests I would have brought my sister who’s currently loitering outside the gates of the palace,” Brig Phillips said. vw,vw,px, px\"Brigadier Clare Phillips thanked her family for their support “But also my mum and dad.“I am absolutely certain that I could not have done any of the things that I have done without Nicky’s support and the support of my family.”Many of the high achievers were recognised for their efforts during the pandemic.Scott McPartlin MBE, a telecoms engineer from Glasgow, was honoured for services to telecoms after he camped in a tent on a beach on the inner Hebridean island of Coll for three days to restore service to a vulnerable remote resident who had lost connection because of a lightning strike.MPs in the House of Commons said his actions were a “shining example of the heroic efforts that key workers were doing across Scotland to keep critical national infrastructure running.”Olivia Strong, founder of Run For Heroes, a campaign which raised millions for the NHS during lockdown, said collecting her MBE “didn’t feel real”.She told PA: “It’s lovely to be recognised for the fundraising done during Covid.“I got an email through and I genuinely thought it was my friends winding me up, and then I realised it was real.”Ms Strong came up with the idea of encouraging people to run k and donate £ to the NHS during lockdown while out running at Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh.The campaign took off and raised about £ million for NHS Charities Together. vw,vw,px, px\"Craig Thomson said his family had made sacrices for him during his career Ms Strong said “the MBE is for everyone” who helped with and took part in the campaign.Craig Thomson, who was a referee for  years in Europe and domestically, was made an MBE for services to football and charity in Scotland.He said: “Surprised, was my first reaction, then I was delighted for recognition for the hard work.”Mr Thomson said he would not have received the award without his family “making sacrices”.He added: “A day like today to come to a palace like this and get an award, it’s recognition both for myself but also for the hard work my family has put in behind the scenes.”Rick Kenney, who has been involved in judo in Scotland, the UK and the Commonwealth for  years, said collecting his OBE made him feel “absolutely proud and elated”. vw,vw,px, px\"Richard Kenney after receiving his OBE during an Investiture ceremony at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh He said the day marked a good day for judo, adding: “It’s great for the sport and giving us a great opportunity to show our worth and to be noted by those whoever take the decisions about the honours.“To give me an OBE was just fabulous.”Former professional basketball player Kieron Achara – who played for Glasgow Rocks, Scotland’s only professional basketball team, and represented Scotland and the UK at national level – described receiving his MBE as “the icing on the cake” of his sports career.He was honoured for services to community sport in Scotland.Asked about the award, the ft in sportsman said: “To be brutally honest I thought it was a prank, I didn’t know it was happening.“At the same time I thought about my papa who was awarded a BEM back in the day and a flood of emotions came back about how proud I was of him, and maybe my kids will think the same, so it was a great honour and such a privilege.”Mr Achara captained Scotland in the  Commonwealth Games, and is chairman of Rocks in the Community Foundation, which uses basketball to create a positive impact on the community. vw,vw,px, px\"Kieron Achara Fiona Drouet – the mother of an undergraduate, Emily, who took her own le after being subjected to a campaign of gender-based violence – could not make the ceremony, but was made an MBE after she set up Scottish charity EmilyTest which helps tackle such violence.Gamekeeper Alexander Hogg, who is based in the Scottish Borders and who has been chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association since , received an MBE for services to gamekeeping in Scotland.He said: “I am overjoyed for the gamekeepers.“This honour has been very rarely awarded for this reason and I’d like to thank the whole gamekeeping family because it is a team, not me.“This is for everyone who has been there for The Scottish Gamekeepers Association all these years, since the outset.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

However, no progress has been made.A petition calling on the council to take action and restore Wilmont House to its former glory has been signed by more than  people so far.It was launched by local woman Sharon Marks, who said she had noticed the poor state of the building while taking walks in Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park during lockdown.“About a year ago, I contacted the council to see what the plans for the building were as it was gted to the council and the people of Belfast,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “For such a beautul building to fall into such a state of disrepair is just so sad. “The council said it was planning on carrying out an expression-of-interest exercise in early  to find someone to bring it back into use, but the pandemic has delayed this. “That really hacked me off, so I got in contact with local politicians to bring things forward, but that didn’t get very far.“One or two people in the council shouldn’t be gatekeepers of Wilmont House. “It was gted to the council and all the people of Belfast. People should be able to enjoy it.“It is such a beautul building and for that amount of heritage and history to be lost would be terrible.”Donal Lyons, a member of Belfast City Council’s growth and regeneration committee, agreed action should be taken.“There’s not many buildings like Wilmont House left in Belfast, let alone ones in such a setting, and we need to ensure that they are protected for future generations,” he said. “We’re lucky to have them. Each one of them captures a moment in the city’s history and everyone has their own personal stories in which these beautul buildings play a role. “We need to do more than just let them sit in decay.”A spokesperson for the council said: “Wilmont House at Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a Grade B-plus listed building owned by Belfast City Council. “We are in the process of preparing an invitation for expressions of interest to go to the market later this year, seeking a suitably qualied developer to restore the building and bring it into a new use.”Wilmont House, which dates back to , served as the headquarters of the US Army in Northern Ireland during the Second World War.

Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said: “The latest survey results paint a dire picture of where our industry currently is after almost two years of restrictions and closures.“It is no exaggeration to say the hospitality sector has never been in a worse position with over % of trade down from  in food, drink and accommodation sales.“The financial burden of the restrictions are becoming apparent as a growing concern with members responding that the cost of unused stock due to poor footfall and restriction, looming tax bills and the cost of extra staff to monitor Covid- passports and provide table service is having serious strain on business viability.“In fact, some businesses have made the dficult decision to close until restrictions can be lted, having a detrimental impact on trade and staff.” SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for a “clear and managed roadmap” out of restrictions.“The success of the vaccination programme and the effort made by people to keep each other safe has put us in a good position to begin planning for the recovery phase of the pandemic. It cannot be dominated by the chaos of the early response,” he said.

It was agreed members would consider the scope of the motion to open discussion up across all communities in the district, aspire to make the proposed consultation process as inclusive as possible, and carry out consultation.At a meeting on November , members agreed to seek professional support to help implement the motion and secure quotations from suitably qualied providers.It is understood quotations will be sought in February with workshops being delivered this spring.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up With regards to the cost, officers believe £, will be required from the council which will be met from within existing budgets resources.The report explained the £, will be broken down into a £, management fee and a workshop promotion and delivery budget that could see £, spent on speaker costs £, spent on PR and marketing costs and £, spent on digital set-up.The report also noted a preliminary equality screening has been carried out by the corporate policy and equality officer and a full screening will be developed before seeking a quotation for the workshop.Councillor Paul McLean said the DUP is opposed to the motion and said that “in today’s climate, £, could be better spent”.Ulster Unionist group leader, Councillor Walter Cuddy said he “totally agreed” with Mr McLean and questioned the work of the good relations working group.“There has been so much money lost to this council through Covid and we are trying to cover the gaps and provide services to the ratepayers which we have not always been able to do,” he said.“Now, as we approach the striking of the rates, we will probably be looking to increase them again. Any ratepayer this past year will note facilities have been closed and a lot of services have not been provided. People will be thinking why should I be paying extra, then they see something like this.“As a party we don’t attend the good relations working group, there is no benefit to us in it and yet it is the forum that decides what we do on this topic.“Should somebody on the good relations working group not be askingbringing an issue like this forward at this time could impact good relations  Nowhere within the report can I see an officer or anybody ask this question.“I am just so disappointed that we can spend our ratepayers’ hard-earned money on this.

In fact, I’d argue the opposite is true - I’m very secure and confident in my unionist credentials.”A spokesperson for the UUP said the party has selection processes and “every aspiring candidate has to abide by the same processes”.“Andy entered the selection process and was interviewed as part of it,” continued the party. “Ian was also interviewed and he emerged as the successful candidate.“Ian Marshall is a positive, confident unionist who is committed to strengthening Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.“We are sorry to see Andy leave the party and we wish him well for the future.”Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumDouble jobbing plans a ‘thoroughly bad idea’, warns chair of Northern Ireland Affairs CommitteeVideo: NI public mostly opposed or ‘sitting on fence’ regarding ‘double-jobbing’ proposalsBig names could help DUP fend off strong opposition in key constituencies PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoing PremiumDon’t tamper with the law on double-jobbing, warns RitchieMost ReadAntrim council gave taskforce boss Rose Mary Stalker over £k for  days’ workHundreds back call to restore Belfast’s Wilmont House to former gloryDUP investigates councillor Adrian McQuillan’s actions for second timeWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days DUP councillor Audrey Wales’ spend on clothes during year as mayor causes further controversyTop VideosPlayWatch: ‘In the name of God, go’, David Davis tells Boris Johnson in fiery Commons PMQs sessionPlayGovernment to withdraw ‘double-jobbing’ amendment, says PMBrian Smith appeared at Newtonards court on Tuesday.A north Belfast was todayconvicted of threatening to kill loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.Following a brief contest at Newtownards Magistrates Court, -year-old Brian Smith was also convicted of harassing Mr Bryson and making a threat that he would petrol bomb the homes of the victims mother and partner, all committed between July -

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

They are drawn from our century-and-half of operational work, and the lived experiences of those we work with today.We believe adopting these priorities will help to ensure people in crisis get the support they need no matter who or where they are.They are not only achievable, they are essential, and we urge all parties and candidates to incorporate them into their planning for the year ahead and beyond.A world where everyone gets the help they need in a crisis is within our reach onlywe choose it to be.l Sharon Sinclair is area director for British Red Cross, Northern IrelandThe publication British Red Cross Policy Priorities for the next Northern Ireland Executive is available on our website at: www.redcross.org.uk about-us what-we-do we-speak-up-for-change british-red-cross-policy-priorities-for-the-next-northern-ireland-executiveMore from the News Letter:Click here – VIDEO: Huge revamp of Belfast would create miles-long leafy avenue... turn Westlink into tunnel... and make city ‘blue again’ Click here – Wall of silence: Home Office suggests it is dangerous to tell public details about turning Carrickfergus hotel into base for foreign nationals Click here – Criminalising conversion therapy: Northern Ireland must avoid – not mimic – Canada’s new law says transgender writerA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And evenit was, the public could have misread such remarks as meaning they were in great danger, when it became apparent late last month that omicron was having a minor health impact. However, it is welcome to hear Dr Black now speak in a reassuring way, and admit that “our worst expectations haven’t been reached”. The covid crisis is not yet over – there have been too many twists and turns so far to be sure of any scenarios in the near future – but it is at a sufficiently mild level where we cannot tolerate the ruin of certain livelihoods and groups of people.Most society leaders — medical, scientic and political —who have demanded rigid controls are themselves financially untouched by lockdown because they are paid by the state.If lockdown does , the financial burden should be more evenly spread so that there is extra money for sectors such as hospitality. Politicians could show leadership by accepting voluntary pay cuts. But let us hope that it does not .We cannot keep planning for worst case scenarios of virus mutations.

All Rights Reserved. WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature SHOWBIZ Film Reviews.“The Strand has a lot of similarities to the Troxy, the same architect. It feels quite nostalgic watching it in a picture house whenever you’re looking at another cinema from the same era.”Mimi said the film had generated a lot of interest prior to its release: “We’ve seen a lot more interest than we normally would.“People are really interested and intrigued, I think people hold Kenneth Branagh in such a sense of pride. He has given back an enormous amount to our creative industry in Northern Ireland, championing what he considers his home town.“The audience are interested, particularly those middle-aged and senior, who will remember the era.”Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle looks ahead to the UK cinema release of Sir Kenneth Branaghs Belfast filmJude Hill plays nine-year-old Buddy, a role based on Branagh himself, in the film which also stars Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Caitriona Balfe and Judi Dench as members of Buddy’s family.It is set at the beginning of the Troubles, but violence, although occasional, is not to the fore in the film.Mimi said: “I think the Troubles is more of a backdrop. It’s incidental to the characters.“There’s definitely a sense that it’s written for a global audience more than a Northern Ireland audience.“It’s got that nostalgia, that wholesomeness which the American love about all things Northern Irish or Irish.”She added: “This is just one person’s story, one person’s memory and obviously stories and narratives change with memory.“It’s that kind of sepia, rose-tinted view that comes whenever you have memories.“Because it is set here I know Kenneth Branagh and Jamie Dornan have said in interviews that they are more nervous that people here will enjoy it and accept it.”Of the staggered release which has seen the film open in America and other parts of the world before the UK, Mimi said: “It is unusual because of pirating for a film not to have one international release date.“People here will already have seen the film, but not on the big screen as it was meant to be showcased.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a report, entitled A UBI Pilot for Wales, the Petitions Committee concluded the current scheme for care leavers “has merit”, but that a wider trial would allow policymakers to learn more about the impact of a UBI.Universal Basic Income is the idea a government should pay all iniduals a set salary, regardless of their means.Last year, the country’s Labour government said it wanted to pilot such a scheme targeting  care leavers by giving them an additional sum of money each month.Proponents of the plans included those who believe UBI should apply to all citizens, and a petition submitted in August  calling for an expansion of the pilot gained over a thousands signatures.The committee, led by chair Jack Sargeant MS, invited a number of experts including Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Will Stronge, director of research at think tank Autonomy, Lydia Godden, Women’s Equality NetworkWales, and Ewan Hilton, CEO of mental health charity Platfform to give evidence on the topic.They concluded the government should consider increasing the size and ersity of the pilot scheme to provide more robust data, and ensure payments are guaranteed, unconditional, and paid to the inidual, not the household.It has also recommended the government make every effort to persuade UK Government departments such as the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to support the widest possible pilot scheme.While they said the pilot should be conducted by independent experts, include a control group and attempt to capture any indirect savings or costs that accrue as a result of the pilot.Mr Sergeant said: “It’s clear from the evidence presented to us that broadening the pilot could have huge benefits.“The Welsh Government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as erse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme..remove“While not all Members of the Committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh Government to consider.“I would like to extend my thanks to the petitioners whose passion for tackling poverty shone through and should be commended, as well as all those who signed the petition.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The Trussell Trust had to give out nearly a million foodbank parcels between April and September last year. That is an  percent increase on the same period in .

Some are receiving  percent less than they were entitled to. It is important that we have a debate.”In a statement updating the House on the UK Covid situation, I said: “I am sure the Secretary of State will want to join me in paying tribute to the staff at Cardf and Vale UHB for their work on the booster programme. He will know that statistics show that Wales is joint first in Europe – we are actually ahead of the UK average – on delivery of boosters, which can only be a good thing for our population. Will he talk a little about the plans for further jabs for the most vulnerable ”And in the statement on BBC funding, I said: “I heard what the Secretary of State said about SC, but my constituents would simply not recognise what she says about the rest of the BBC being some sort of London bubble. We have seen a  percent increase in our creative economy locally, with thousands of people employed. Every pound invested in our local economy by the BBC generates almost double in .

I am so proud of myself, women’s football and I am proud for my wee village of Stewarton.”The -year-old attracted the interest of scouts at Celtic when she started playing as a child, and was allowed to take part provided she cut her hair short and called herself Ross.She then went on to play for Reims as a teenager, and later joined ACF Milan, and was a member of the victorious Italian national side which won the Mundialito, the precursor to the women’s World Cup, in .“This recognition is good for the future players, the wee girls, that they can see that they can achieve something as a woman footballer in Scotland,” she added.“I can sit back on my laurels now.”When asked about how her conversation with Princess Anne went, she replied: “I said ‘Your Royal Highness, it’s a pleasure to get my MBE off a fellow sportswoman’..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Former footballer Rose Reilly received an MBE “She said, ‘I was interested, Rose, how come you played for Italy ’ And I said because I was banned from playing for Scotland, Scotland didn’t want me, but the Italians did, and she said ‘how amazing’.”Elsewhere, Brigadier Clare Phillips, colonel of career management operations at the Army’s Personnel Centre and co-chairwoman of the Army LGBT+ Network, was made a CBE.When asked about meeting Princess Anne, the former Royal Electrical and Mechanical EngineersCorps colonel said she felt “incredibly honoured”.She added: “I’ve been practising my curtsy, which is not something that I have regularly had to do in the past.“The Princess Royal was incredibly kind and she remembered that I am part of the REME, and that we recently rehomed the Corps to what was RAF Lyneham and which is now MoD Lyneham.“I was able to remind her that her father, his Royal Highness Prince Philip, opened the barracks just about five years ago, and it’s a superb new home for us, which was part of the reason that I’m privileged to have been given this award.”Brig Phillips, who joined the Army in , a time when she could have been discharged for being gay, was accompanied by her we Nicky, who has served in the police for  years.“Had I been able to bring more guests I would have brought my sister who’s currently loitering outside the gates of the palace,” Brig Phillips said. vw,vw,px, px\"Brigadier Clare Phillips thanked her family for their support “But also my mum and dad.“I am absolutely certain that I could not have done any of the things that I have done without Nicky’s support and the support of my family.”Many of the high achievers were recognised for their efforts during the pandemic.Scott McPartlin MBE, a telecoms engineer from Glasgow, was honoured for services to telecoms after he camped in a tent on a beach on the inner Hebridean island of Coll for three days to restore service to a vulnerable remote resident who had lost connection because of a lightning strike.MPs in the House of Commons said his actions were a “shining example of the heroic efforts that key workers were doing across Scotland to keep critical national infrastructure running.”Olivia Strong, founder of Run For Heroes, a campaign which raised millions for the NHS during lockdown, said collecting her MBE “didn’t feel real”.She told PA: “It’s lovely to be recognised for the fundraising done during Covid.“I got an email through and I genuinely thought it was my friends winding me up, and then I realised it was real.” vw,vw,px, px\"Olivia Strong after receiving her MBE in Edinburgh for her services to fundraising during the pandemic Ms Strong came up with the idea of encouraging

in Europe and domestically, was made an MBE for services to football and charity in Scotland.He said: “Surprised, was my first reaction, then I was delighted for recognition for the hard work.”Mr Thomson said he would not have received the award without his family “making sacrices”.He added: “A day like today to come to a palace like this and get an award, it’s recognition both for myself but also for the hard work my family has put in behind the scenes.”Rick Kenney, who has been involved in judo in Scotland, the UK and the Commonwealth for  years, said collecting his OBE made him feel “absolutely proud and elated”. vw,vw,px, px\"Richard Kenney after receiving his OBE during an Investiture ceremony at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh He said the day marked a good day for judo, adding: “It’s great for the sport and giving us a great opportunity to show our worth and to be noted by those whoever take the decisions about the honours.“To give me an OBE was just fabulous.”Former professional basketball player Kieron Achara – who played for Glasgow Rocks, Scotland’s only professional basketball team, and represented Scotland and the UK at national level – described receiving his MBE as “the icing on the cake” of his sports career.He was honoured for services to community sport in Scotland.Asked about the award, the ft in sportsman said: “To be brutally honest I thought it was a prank, I didn’t know it was happening.“At the same time I thought about my papa who was awarded a BEM back in the day and a flood of emotions came back about how proud I was of him, and maybe my kids will think the same, so it was a great honour and such a privilege.”Mr Achara captained Scotland in the  Commonwealth Games, and is chairman of Rocks in the Community Foundation, which uses basketball to create a positive impact on the community. vw,vw,px, px\"Kieron Achara Fiona Drouet – the mother of an undergraduate, Emily, who took her own le after being

It was agreed members would consider the scope of the motion to open discussion up across all communities in the district, aspire to make the proposed consultation process as inclusive as possible and carry out consultation engagement broadly in line with the community planning themes.At a further meeting on November , members agreed to seeks professional support to help practically implement the motion and a specication and secure quotations from suitably qualied experienced providers in order to practicallyimplement the requirements of the motion.It is understood quotations will be sought in February  with workshops being delivered in the spring of this year.With regards to the cost, officers believe £, will be required from the council which will be met from within existing budgets resources.The report explains the £, will be broken down into a £, management fee and a workshop promotion and delivery budget that could see £, spent on speaker costs £, spent on PR and marketing costs and £, spent on digital set up.The report also notes a preliminary equality screening has been carried out by the corporate policy and equality officer and notes a full screening will be developed prior to seeking a quotation for the delivery of the workshop.Commenting on the matter, Councillor Paul McLean said the DUP are opposed to the motion and expressed the belief that “in today’s climate, £, could be better spent”.Ulster UnionistParty group leader, Councillor Walter Cuddy said he “totally agreed” with Councillor McLean and questioned the work of the good relations working group.“There has been so much money lost to this council through Covid and we are trying to cover the gaps and provide services to the ratepayers which we have not always been able to do,” he said.“Now, as we approach the striking of the rates, we will probably be looking to increase them again. Any ratepayer this past year will note facilities have been closed and a lot of services have not been provided. People will be thinking why should I be paying extra, then they see something like this.“As a party we don’t attend the good relations working group, there is no benefit to us in it and yet it is the forum that decides what we do on this topic.“Should somebody on the good relations working group not be askingbringing an issue like this forward at this time could impact good relations  Nowhere within the report can I see an officer or anybody ask this question.“I am just so disappointedthat we can spend our ratepayers’ hard-earned money on this.
