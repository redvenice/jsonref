The number of flights into and out of the UK hit its highest since the first lockdowns in March 2020 - following the reopening of travel to the US earlier this month. Crisps supplies have been disrupted by an IT computer upgrade at the world’s biggest crisp factory.  Leicester-based Walkers said last month that the glitch forced it to slow production, forcing the company to prioritise its most popular varieties – including cheese and onion, ready salted and salt and vinegar, as well as Quavers and Wotsits. Kantar Public’s survey of 275 stores also found that paracetamol and ibuprofen were also in relatively short supply. However, a group of 48 wine and spirits companies yesterday warned that Britain is facing a Christmas alcohol shortage unless the government does more to address the lack of HGV drivers. This is due to “excellent momentum” in China and the United States as well as a strong recovery in Europe, the firm says. Remy Cointreau now expects “very strong” growth in organic operating profits this year, and strong sales too. Chief executive officer Eric Vallat said in a statement. Here’s the full story: And here’s reaction from ITV’s Joel Hills: European equities hit a three-week low earlier this week, as fears of fresh lockdowns rippled through markets. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets thinks it could be a subdued day: However company investment and government spending both declined, while imports and exports both fell quarter-on-quarter, and net trade weighed on growth. GFK’s survey found that people’s propensity to buy has fallen to a nine-month low, with the indicator halving to 9.7 points. This weakness is likely to weigh on Germany’s economy this quarter, especially as yesterday’s IFO survey showed a drop in business confidence. Consumer confidence in Germany has been hit by the surge in coronavirus infections, and the jump in inflation hitting households this winter. The GfK institute’s consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -1.6 points heading into December, down sharply from 1.0 points a month earlier. That’s the lowest reading since June, and below expectations. GfK economist Rolf Buerkl said the fourth wave in the COVID-19 pandemic, with skyrocketing infection rates and hospitals reaching capacity limits, was causing concerns that more restrictions for shops and restaurants were on the cards. This slide in consumer morale in Europe’s largest economy will dampen business prospects for the upcoming Christmas shopping season, Buerkl adds: Some German states have already cancelled this year’s Christmas markets, due to concerns about the surge in Covid-19 cases, but others are going ahead. America’s central bank could wrap up its stimulus programme and raise interest rates earlier than expected, with inflation at a 30-year high and the jobs market improving. The Fed started tapering its $120bnmonth asset purchase scheme at this month’s meeting, cutting it by $15bn per month -- at which rate it would end by next June. But the minutes drop a clear hint that tapering could be speeded up: Some more dovish Fed members stressed they should take a “patient attitude” toward incoming data given supply chain problems and the pandemic. The prospect of the Fed tightening policy faster than expected has weighed on the pound and the euro in recent weeks. Last night, sterling touched its lowest level of 2021, trading at just $1.3325 to the US dollar. The euro is even weaker - at its lowest against the US dollar since July 2020, and near a 21-month low against the pound. The FOMC Minutes suggested the doves on the committee are “in retreat”, says Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA: The news yesterday that US jobless claims have plunged to the lowest level since 1969 could also encourage the Fed to tighten policy faster. Deutsche Bank expect the Fed to press down on the taper accelerator in December, by doubling the cuts to its purchases of US government debt (Treasuries) and mortgage-backed securities. That would wrap the scheme up three months sooner than planned, as DB strategist Jim Reid explains: Something for investors to ponder.

Photograph: Pat SammonThe Government has been advised in a new report that it should legislate to remove a ban on commercial peat harvesting, potentially for the next 14 years.The final report of the Working Group to review the use of peat moss in horticulture, commissioned by Minister for Heritage Malcolm Noonan, makes a number of recommendations aimed at supporting jobs in the industry, which is worth €477 million a year.The working group was chaired by consultant Munoo Prasad, who is a former chief scientist at Bord Na Móna. The report was delivered to Mr Noonan in October but has yet to be published.Commercial peat harvesting was effectively banned by the High Court in 2019, which found large-scale harvesting required planning permission as well as a licence from the EPA, and detailed environmental impact assessments, required under EU law.The group said it was concerned at risks to jobs in a transition period while alternatives to peat were sourced – particularly for the mushroom industry which has warned it is dependent on supplies.The report recommends that “the use of peat in horticulture should be phased out by 2030 or by the very latest by 2035, providing alternative materials were available”.It also recommends peat should be available over the short term in sufficient quantities “from existing ecologically destroyed bogs that were prepared for harvesting for the last few years and are lying fallow”. It called for amendments to the current legislative provisions for large scale peat extraction.“ For the professional horticulture sector, this is absolutely critical for the 2022 season” it said.In a statement Mr Noonan said the “ potential of alternatives to the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry was examined extensively by the group”. He said the report is “being considered and will be brought to Cabinet in due course.”The Minister is known to be opposed to large scale harvesting and has previously said reopening harvesting was not on the Green Agenda or Government policy.Last weeked, he told RTÉ there needs to be an alternative product to peat, but the State should phase out commercial harvesting “completely”On Tuesday Fine Gael Senator Regina Doherty introduced a Bill in the Seanad to “end Irish horticultural growers’ reliance on expensive imported peat as a growing medium for their produce by allowing them to extract Irish peat as part of a just transition”.She said her Horticultural Peat (Temporary Measures) Bill 2021, was necessary as producers have no option but to import peat from places such as Latvia. “We have acres of peatland right here, with only 0.12 per cent of total Irish peatland required for the purposes of horticulture.”But Friends of the Irish Environment, which has taken a number of cases to the courts against harvesting, said that figures released by the Central Statistics Office show that exports of peat for 2021 are now at more than 500,000 tons. with 70,725 tons added in August and September.“The industry’s claim that exports are a matter of the past is not born out by the newly released figures,” spokesman Tony Lowes said."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 contact tracers contracts extended to end of june 2022","story":"More than 200,000 Covid-19 tests have been carried out over the past seven days, putting the test and tracing system under heavy strain.

Photograph: Laura Hutton  The Experts who have been tracking the effectiveness of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine have found that the risk of Covid infection begins to increase 90 days after people had a second dose.The study backs up the need for booster doses to prevent people suffering breakthrough infections as immunity wanes, according to the team, who published their findings in the British Medical Journal (BMJ).Over five million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been administered in Ireland, making it the main vaccine used here. However, booster doses are only given here five months after the second dose.Experts from the Research Institute of Leumit Health Services in Israel found a gradual increase in the risk of Covid-19 infection from 90 days after people received a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.Israel was one of the first countries to roll out a large scale Covid-19 vaccination campaign in December 2020, but has been battling a resurgence in infections and has been looking closely at waning immunity.The experts examined electronic health records for 80,057 adults (with an average age of 44) who had a PCR test between mid-May and September at least three weeks after their second vaccine injection.None of the people in the sample had evidence of previous Covid-19 infection.Of the group of 80,057 people, 7,973 (9.6 per cent) had a positive test result.They were then matched to people of the same age and ethnic group who tested negative in the same week.The study found that the rate of positive results was found to rise in line with the time since people had had their second dose.Across all age groups, 1.3 per cent of people tested positive 21-89 days after a second dose, but this increased to 2.4 per cent after 90-119 days 4.6 per cent after 120-149 days 10.3 per cent after 150-179 days and 15.5 per cent after 180 days or more.Compared with the first 90 days after a second dose, the risk of infection across all age groups was 2.37-fold higher after 90-119 days 2.66-fold higher after 120-149 days 2.82-fold higher after 150-179 days and 2.82-fold higher after 180 days or more.While the study is observational in nature, the experts said it appears clear that immunity wanes after the first three months of being double-vaccinated.They said: “Large scale Covid-19 vaccination campaigns can achieve control over the spread of the virus, but even in countries with high vaccination rates, breakthrough infections can occur.“The risk of (Covid) infection in adults who received two vaccine injections increased with time elapsed since vaccination compared with the reference (iniduals vaccinated in the last 90 days).”AstraZeneca has said antibody protection from its vaccine also wanes, although its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said on Tuesday that the jab is thought to offer long-term T-cell immunity for older people, which could be better than other vaccines. –PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"big gap remains between eu and uk over brexit deal for ni says coveney","story":" Minister for Foreign Affairs  Simon Coveney: said  there was a chance ‘to seize momentum’ toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere is still “quite a big gap” between the EU and the UK in the dispute over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade rules, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said. The Minister told the Seanad Brexit committee that there was “a lot at stake over the next few weeks” given the potential “carryover” for the EU-UK trade deal to be affected if the London government decides to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol over the row.The EU has warned that the protocol and trade agreement were “inextricably linked” and that it would respond “very robustly” to the suspension of parts of the protocol under Article 16.Brussels would regard this “as a fairly serious breach of good faith,” said Mr Coveney. “That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland or in the UK,” he said.Mr Coveney said that there was a chance “to seize momentum” toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute over the protocol but that it required “a much more positive, much more stable, much more trusting EU-UK relationship.”“We have some way to go to get there,” he added.The EU and the UK are locked in negotiations in a bid to break the deadlock over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it creates a trade barrier between Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government is seeking changes to the protocol and has threatened to trigger the Article 16 clause of the protocol to suspend parts of its operation if it is not changed. Under the protocol, Northern Ireland remains under EU trade rules for goods. Mr Coveney told Independent senator Michael McDowell that the UK government’s request for all goods coming from Britain sold in Northern Ireland to be exempt from all checks and customs declarations was “a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver.” The EU can “go a long way” to reduce those checks significantly, he said, referring to the EU’s proposals to reduce food checks by 80 per cent and customs checks by 50 per cent.Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost had “shown a lot of scepticism” on whether these proposals are possible but Mr Coveney said the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic and his team were “very clear and strong” that they can deliver on those proposals. The UK “has got to give something here too”, said Mr Coveney.On the prospect of a compromise being reached, he said he was “more hopeful than I was a fortnight ago.”Mr Coveney described Lord Frost as a “good and tough negotiator” and that the British negotiating tactic has been “very successful in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU” but it has not been successful in terms of “reputation and relationships.” The Minister said the way the UK government had behaved over the last 10 months had “put a lot of strain” on relationships, between the EU and the UK, between the Ireland and the UK and, at times, between the UK and the US given the responses from the White House and Capitol Hill.However, he said he was very anxious to focus on “the limited but nevertheless limited progress of the last 10 days or so.”He said the Government wanted to maximise the opportunities in the post-Brexit trade deal agreed by the EU and UK and to develop the future relationship with the UK positively.“In order to achieve this, the parties must work together, in a spirit of partnership and trust. When trust is compromised, progress is threatened,” said Mr Coveney.“The recent UK approach to the protocol has unfortunately called that trust into question. I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum toward agreeing a constructive way forward.” How is Brexit affecting you?

At 8.10am more than 280,000 people were waiting to buy tickets for the gigs on Friday, September 9th and Saturday, September 10th. Now, tickets are also on sale for a third date of Sunday, September 11th. That concert too looks like it is going to sell out as there are now 90,000 people waiting online to buy tickets. Planning permission had already been given for the two concerts, but there is room for five in total. The country singer’s five concerts at the venue in 2014 were cancelled because of objections from locals and a refusal by Dublin City Council to grant planning permission for the events. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Brooks played down the possibility of being able to sell five concerts out this time around. Referring to the cancelled dates he said he hoped there would be a “blessing in that curse and now hopefully we have a chance to play Ireland”. When asked would he like to do five shows again, he responded: “I’d like to, but I’d also like to be six foot five and have abs.“You had 400,000 tickets in one city and one show. There’s no way we are going to do those numbers again. Would I like it? Yes. Is it going to happen? I think it would be impossible.”Promoter Peter Aiken said he was “relieved and delighted” by the response to the concerts going on sale. “He is bigger than he was the last time. There was 100,000 people logged on to Ticketmaster before the concerts went on sale. “That’s underheard of even in the United States. You would normally expect 30,000 to 40,000 people in the queue for a big outdoor show.” Ticketmaster is currently managing the system that it does not crash and is letting people in in tranches.

File photograph: The A requirement for children in primary school to wear masks is expected to be discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) when it meets on Thursday.Some members of the group believe such a move would help stem the rise in infections in younger children, though the Government does not intend to introduce any new restrictions this week.If a recommendation is made by Nphet, it is likely to be considered by Government next week.Latest figures show that primary school-aged children now have the highest Covid-19 incidence of any age group, with some 10,000 positive cases in the past fortnight. A report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) also notes that the infection rate for primary school-aged children has been rising since mid-October, but the risk of transmission within a school still remains “low”, while public health advisers have suggested to Government that much of the infection among children is coming from parents, rather than in school. The report says increases among pre-school and primary-aged children have been consistent with increases across other age groups over the same time period.“The risk of onward transmission from undetected asymptomatic cases within the school setting remains low,” it adds.Booster vaccinesSources also say Nphet may recommend that people avoid visiting older relatives until their relatives have received their booster shot of the vaccine. Some sources say there is a significant danger when unvaccinated children visit older relatives whose immunity is waning.There are also concerns that some people in their 60s will not be fully covered by boosters before Christmas Day. A booster shot takes about seven days to take full effect, meaning mid-December is the cut-off for full protection on Christmas Day itself. The HSE is likely to make walk-in vaccines available before mid-December, while people can also seek a shot in pharmacies, rather than wait to be called, if they are eligible.About 190,000 shots were given last week, and that is to rise to 240,000-270,000 in the coming weeks, though this is still short of the summer peak of about 300,000 a week.Pace of rolloutA meeting of a powerful senior officials group on Wednesday, chaired by the State’s top civil servant, Martin Fraser, emphasised the need to get as many people, especially those in older cohorts, boosters before Christmas, when intergenerational mixing will accelerate. The Covid Oversight Group, which also involves senior Nphet members, examined constraints on the speed of vaccination. Secretary general of the Department of Health Robert Watt is understood to have urged that the pace of the booster rollout be increased in the coming days. The number of staff working on the vaccination programme is lower than during the summer, when healthcare staff were redeployed. However, the pressures associated with the current Covid wave are such that healthcare workers cannot be spared from the front line, with thousands also off on Covid-related absences. Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency is expected to announce its recommendation on the use of the Pfizer vaccine in five-11 year olds by the end of this week. Any go-ahead would first have to be confirmed by Irish regulatory authorities before rollout here, and it is unlikely the vaccine could be administered to primary schoolchildren before the new year.There is hope in Government circles that the rise in case numbers, test positivity and Covid-19 hospitalisation may be plateauing. However, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Fine Gael parliamentary party that if cases were plateauing, it was at a worryingly high level. He said that everything possible would be done to avoid another lockdown.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Officials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissenters"},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister appears burned perhaps expect much","story":"“Good, of course.”“That sounds wizard.

Quite possibly not. Or Meredith Kercher? The name of the 21-year-old British student raped and murdered in Perugia, Italy, 14 years ago is probably more familiar.Now how about the name Amanda Knox, aka ‘Foxy Knoxy’? Chances are that you will not only know her name, but also the face of the slightly oddball American girl who was accused of murdering her friend in a “sex game gone wrong”.Knox is so inextricably linked to the events of November 1 2007 that the New York Post ran a headline last year saying: “Man Who Killed Amanda Knox’s Roommate Freed on Community Service.” The “man” in that headline was Guede, an habitual criminal who was convicted of murdering the “roommate”, Kercher and who, this week, has been controversially released from jail after serving just 13 years and six months of his 16-year sentence. Yet the public fascination with Knox is so intense that it is her name that remains shorthand for the horrific crime, with that of her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito – who also spent four years in prison before being acquitted by the Supreme Court in Rome – having become hardly more than a footnote. Even now photographers wait outside 34-year-old Knox’s house in Seattle, hoping to snap the first pictures of her with her baby daughter, named Eureka.Little wonder, then, that she has called on the newly freed Guede to confess to the crime – which he has always denied, despite DNA evidence – and clear her name once and for all. “Guede holds a tremendous power to heal others harmed by his actions. He has the power to tell the truth, to take responsibility, to stop blaming me for the rape and murder of Meredith Kercher, which a wealth of evidence shows he committed alone,” Knox wrote on Twitter this week.So is it time for us to let go of our fictionalised version of ‘Foxy Knoxy’ and allow married mother Knox to reclaim her life, and her name? Where can she go from here?According to Knox, “the controversy, not the truth, is what people care about more”, and the reason that controversy lingers on is that the Italian courts have never accepted Guede acted alone.Guede – who was arrested three weeks after the murder and convicted in a fast-track trial – holds in his hands the ability to clear Knox’s name once and for all. The Italian courts could, if they wanted, apologise for the four years she spent in prison and the eight-year legal process in which she was enmeshed, but to do so would be to admit to embarrassing flaws in the country’s legal system.Yet Italian prosecutors would not let go of a bizarre theory that detectives had formed from the off: that Kercher had been murdered because she refused to take part in a “sex game” with Knox and Sollecito. The pair were convicted of murder in 2009 in 2011 their convictions were quashed in 2013 a new trial was ordered, then in 2015 Italy’s Supreme Court exonerated them for good. Knox blames the police’s preferred scenario on a “misogynist fantasy” – one which so excited the public imagination that Matt Damon’s current thriller Stillwater is based on the Knox trial, and it also helped inspire new BBC drama Showtrial, both more than a decade on.She did not, it must be said, help herself in the way she behaved after the murder: having implicated an entirely innocent local man, bartender Patrick Lumumba in the crime. She was photographed kissing Sollecito in public, which was taken as evidence of her guilt – though she insists that she did not, contrary to reports at the time, perform a cartwheel in the local police station. In her 2013 autobiography, Waiting To Be Heard, Knox admits that she is not good at “social norms” and accepts that her behaviour could have been misconstrued.Nowadays, we are more aware of the sexist stereotypes that paint women as “she-devils” and “ice queens” – both accusations thrown at Knox during that time. Would she be treated differently now?Her detractors (and it must be said that the Kercher family has never explicitly accepted she is innocent) accuse her of hypocrisy in asking to be left alone. She has, after all, written a memoir, given numerous interviews to newspapers, television and radio, hosts her own podcast, and has reportedly negotiated exclusive rights for pictures of herself with her daughter, born earlier this year to husband, novelist Christopher Robinson. In her defence, Knox says that she needs the money to pay off her family’s huge legal bills, and that turning around her reputation by standing up to the critics – reclaiming her own story – is her only hope of freeing her daughter from the curse that follows her name. She could hardly, she has also pointed out, get a regular job given the press who still regularly follow her around. She is in touch with Monica Lewinsky, whom she regards as a fellow victim of misogyny in the early years of 24-hour rolling news and social media a woman who for decades was characterised as a guilty party despite being a young intern in thrall to the most powerful man in the world. A woman whose name is still used as shorthand for that scandal, rather than Bill Clinton’s. Twenty years on, Lewinsky has found a new voice campaigning against cyberbullying, in the same way that Knox now hopes to raise awareness of other victims of wrongful conviction.Knox, then, does not intend to disappear, saying this week in response to those who suggest that she changes her name: “My name is not wrong, they’re wrong about me.”“I am not Foxy Knoxy,” she insists – and it is this misinterpretation of her character that she wants to see off. The nickname, unearthed on her social media profile by a reporter, dated back to childhood and, she has always insisted, was given to her because of her wily skills as a footballer.Either way, her rhyming epithet was irresistible to headline writers, and has come to define her in the public eye. In Britain it marked her out as a vamp in Italy it was even more damaging, as the public associated it with fox-like cunning, the sort that would course through the veins of a murderer.“The prosecution and the media crafted a story, and a doppelgänger version of me, onto which people could affix all their uncertainties, fears and moral judgments. People liked that story: the psychotic man-eater, the dirty ice queen, Foxy Knoxy,” she has said. Strangers who sent her lingerie and love letters were, she adds, taken in by the “cardboard cut out” character. “Amanda’s out of prison, but she’s not out of the prison of public vilification,” her husband, Robinson, has explained.Rudy Guede is the only person who knows what happened that night, but he says he “just wants to be forgotten”. Unlike Amanda Knox, he is likely to be granted his wish.Additional reporting by Claudia RowanMore from NewsMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on migrant lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaEU set to propose \u0026#39nine-month expiry date\u0026#39 on Covid vaccine passports for travelWhy do migrants risk their lives in the English channel over staying in France?And still they come...

Focussing on a single immune response can distort our understanding of the epidemic process, especially as we are constrained by what we can easily measure. For example, the antibody studies conducted in the UK last year are likely to have significantly underestimated the degree of exposure to Covid-19 prior to lockdown, partly because antibodies wane rapidly and also because many people fended off infection without developing antibodies, as shown by recent studies on T-cells.While it is not that useful to speculate on whether one vaccine is better than another, we should recognise that infection-blocking immunity is temporary, while immunity against severe disease and death is likely durable. This is in line with our understanding of the transmission dynamics of other coronaviruses with which we exist without complaint because they do not cause a significant burden of serious disease.It is now widely agreed that Covid-19 is close to becoming endemic, in a way we enjoy with other seasonal coronaviruses, where the reduction in risk to vulnerable people is primarily achieved through the maintenance of high levels of infection-blocking immunity in the population (otherwise known as herd immunity) through regular infection. The vaccines that we currently employ appear to be highly effective in preventing life-threatening illness but do not meaningfully contribute to the maintenance of herd immunity.Now that we have protected the majority of the population – including those who did not need it – against severe disease and death from Covid-19, we should focus our attention on those who are vulnerable and yet remain unprotected. This applies to the global population of vulnerable people, especially those in poorer nations, rather than just your sceptical neighbour.It is also important to recognise that our long history of previous exposure to seasonal coronaviruses may well have protected many of us from severe Covid-19. It is my opinion that repeated exposure to related influenza strains has so far averted a pandemic of the proportions of the devastating pandemic of 1918. Prior to 1918, influenza most likely died out completely within inter-pandemic periods. Since the previous influenza pandemic had occurred in 1890, most iniduals under the age of 30 had no experience of it and they are the ones who died.Based on these principles, a shift in focus towards vaccines which prevent death but not necessarily infection is long overdue. Before vaccines, the only viable solution was to protect the vulnerable population through state-sanctioned shielding. The vaccines should have changed that, but instead we find ourselves trapped by the superannuated conviction that vaccines must block infection as well as disease.Sunetra Gupta is professor of theoretical epidemiology at the Department of Zoology, University of OxfordMore from NewsMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on migrant lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaEU set to propose \u0026#39nine-month expiry date\u0026#39 on Covid vaccine passports for travelWhy do migrants risk their lives in the English channel over staying in France?And still they come...

A Roman Stephen Fry maybe.”Roman high society held Greek philosophy, literature and language in high regard. The placement of the mosaic in the 3rd or 4th century villa complex is significant, according to Mr Carter.“It was placed on the floor of the room used for dining and entertaining, he said. It’s definitely a way to show off at dinner parties, or like us doing up our homes when we can.“It shows off his status - he was high-status, wealthy, intellectual. This was an educated person.”Professor Ken Dark, author and Roman expert, believes that the ostentatious four-panel mosaic indicates “an awareness of Greek literature” and was likely “intended to impress guests with how highly educated the owner was”.He added: “It is displaying erudition, like quoting one of the classics of English literature at a dinner party.”The reference to a Greek epic by the ancient equivalent of rural British gentry, based on what would likely have been an agricultural centre, also supports the view that Roman and early Medieval Britain was not a “cultural backwater”.The find was made in the field of Brian Naylor, a Rutland landowner, by his son Jim Irvine, who contacted heritage authorities in 2020 after finding shards of pottery on a family walk.Excavations by a University of Leicester team revealed significant finds, including two mysterious sets of human remains likely placed at the site after the Roman period.While further work is needed to properly examine and date the site, the uniqueness of the literary mosaic has led John Thomas, the dig leader of University of Leicester Archaeological Services, to hail the artwork as “the most exciting Roman mosaic discovery in the UK in the last century”.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “To have uncovered such a rare mosaic of this size, as well as a surrounding villa, is remarkable.Discoveries like this are so important in helping us piece together our shared history. By protecting this site we are able to continue learning from it, and look forward to what future excavations may teach us about the people who lived there over 1,500 years ago.Visitors will not be allowed at the site, however, as the mosaic crafted from pieces of ceramic and coloured stone will remain buried for the foreseeable future, to protect the artwork from the elements pending further excavation.On Wednesday, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport officially marked the villa as a Scheduled Monument on the advice of Historic England. The public body is now working with Rutland County Council on how best to display other finds unearthed at the site.While the site remains closed to the public indefinitely, the moment of the mosaic’s discovery will be broadcast next year on the BBC’s Digging for Britain, hosted by Prof Alice Roberts. More from NewsMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on migrant lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaEU set to propose \u0026#39nine-month expiry date\u0026#39 on Covid vaccine passports for travelWhy do migrants risk their lives in the English channel over staying in France?And still they come...

In what Nasa scientists see as a test run for saving the planet from extinction, they have launched their first spacecraft designed to stop a huge space rock from colliding with Earth.The aim of the Dart spacecraft that blasted off yesterday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California is to target a small asteroid called Dimorphos, which takes just over two years to orbit the sun. Although this space rock poses no direct threat to Earth, Nasa is keen to test its ability to prevent our planet from being hit by a far larger comet.A comet strike sixty-six million years ago is credited with bringing the reign of the dinosaurs to an end, as well as eradicating most plant and animal species. But while asteroids arguably pose a far greater threat to mankind than climate change, our ability to protect ourselves from such an eventuality has largely been consigned to the realms of science fiction, as depicted in the 1998 movie Armageddon, where the comet is destroyed by flying nuclear bombs into its core.This week’s Nasa mission has more modest ambitions, merely seeking to deflect an asteroid from hitting Earth rather than destroying it completely. But the project, which should result in Dart smashing into its target at 15,000mph in September 2022, just goes to show the rapid advances being made in man’s ability to conquer the challenges of space, for both good and bad.For, while it is hard to question the merits of a programme that aims to save mankind from oblivion, other developments in the realms of space are far more problematic – Russia’s successful test-firing earlier this month of an anti-satellite missile among them.The estimated 3,000 satellites currently circling the globe play a vital role in our everyday lives, such as facilitating communications and travel. They also make a crucial contribution to the modern battlefield, which might explain why the Kremlin is investing so much effort in acquiring the means to destroy them.The destruction of a defunct Soviet-era intelligence satellite by Russia’s new Nudol anti-satellite weapons system, which provoked widespread criticism from the West and caused the seven-man crew of the International Space Station to take shelter, was a dramatic demonstration of Moscow’s ability to destroy key elements of our national infrastructure.China, too, has recently demonstrated alarming new developments in its space-oriented missile capabilities, such as its recent test of a hypersonic glide vehicle, a manoeuvrable spacecraft that can carry a nuclear warhead, which has the ability to fire a separate missile in mid-flight.Rivalry in space between the world’s major powers is nothing new. One of the defining contests of the Cold War era was the desperate race between Washington and Moscow to put a man on the Moon.What is different about the modern-day struggle between the world’s major powers for mastery of space is the potentially devastating impact it could have on our well-being. While the Cold War rivalry was essentially a race to the Moon, today’s contest is all about which power can inflict the maximum amount of damage against an adversary through the application of space technology.Russian President Vladimir Putin, moreover, has a long history of employing new war-fighting techniques to achieve his goals. The current migrant crisis in Eastern Europe, which Moscow has been accused of encouraging, is a classic exercise in hybrid warfare, where Russia and its Belarusian ally are callously exploiting the plight of hapless migrants to cause isions among EU leaders.And if, as many Eastern Europeans fear, the Russian leader were to cause further unrest by launching another military offensive against Ukraine in the coming months, he would almost certainly exploit Russia’s mastery of space technology to his advantage.Russia already has the ability to disrupt navigation systems used by the West that rely on satellites, as RAF Typhoon pilots involved in operations against Islamic State discovered when their systems were subjected to Russian jamming. Moscow would certainly employ these and other space-linked tactics against Ukraine in the event of renewed hostilities.With adversaries like Russia and China seeking to become the dominant powers in space, the priority for the Western powers now is to ensure they are equal to the challenge. There is certainly a widespread recognition that space must be taken seriously as a new frontier in modern warfare, with the US, France and Britain all establishing their own military space command structures during the past decade.The concern, though, with Russia and China demonstrating their technical mastery of this new technology, is that there is no guarantee the West can win the latest space race.     More from NewsMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on migrant lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaEU set to propose \u0026#39nine-month expiry date\u0026#39 on Covid vaccine passports for travelWhy do migrants risk their lives in the English channel over staying in France?And still they come...

Aasia Majid, an adviser at Citizens Advice Manchester, said: “We’re hearing every day from people who’ve never had a food bank voucher but now can’t afford the weekly shop. “Their income is the same or less but their costs have shot up. “I spoke to one man who said things are so bad he’s keeping warm at night by wearing three jumpers and lying on the sofa with his dog.” Gordon, who in his s and from Devon, had to give up his job as an engineer when he was diagnosed with spinal cancer in . He has been claiming Universal Credit as he can’t work, but recently saw this drop by £ a week. “I don’t buy the things I need,” said Gordon, not his real name. “I’m constantly looking at the bank account. “It’s the epitome of being tight but I’ve got to be very careful. “I put things off as I can’t afford the petrol to drive. “I feel isolated and stressed, but what can I do  “I’m living in one room to keep the heat down as low as I possibly can, but everything is just mounting up. “It’s direct debit after direct debit and any minute I think I’m going to be in the minus.” Recently published figures showed inflation jumped from .% in September to a near -year high of .% last month. The cost of everything from petrol and energy to food and drink prices has shot up. With inflation outstripping underlying wage growth, many workers are enduring a real terms pay cut. Citizens Advice analysed average income data against household spending on essentials like rent, bills and food to establish how many families can meet their living costs. Among the three million households facing financial crisis are , who have less than £ spare each month after covering their basic living costs, putting them at risk of hardshipthey faced an unexpected bill. A survey of , adults by the charity shows more than a third of people are worried about paying their bills this winter, rising to nearly half of those on low incomes. One in five have already cut back on their food shopping, or used less heating in the past three months to save money. And one in  of those questioned said they were preparing to ask for help this winter, including from food banks or with fuel vouchers.Citizens Advice said many low-income families have been hit by a “triple whammy” of the £-a-week Universal Credit cut, soaring energy bills and rising inflation.The consequences are already starting to be felt. In the past three months, nearly three quarters of frontline staff at Citizens Advice reported an increase in the number of people coming to them unable to afford essential household costs such as food, rent and heating. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “All of us are noticing our bills go up, but for people on the tightest budgets there’s simply nothing left to cut back on. “Many are getting into debt and finding that accessing crisis support like food banks is the only way to get by. “Our frontline advisers are already seeing these dire consequences of the cost of living crisis. “The government has a crucial opportunity to intervene before things escalate even further. We’d urge them to act now and increase benefits in line with inflation this December.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But as it stands, the Standards Committee is not due to report to the Government until January. Image: REUTERSByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments Double-jobbing Tory MPs are set to rake in more than £, while Boris Johnson dithers over a sleaze clampdown.An analysis of parliamentaposs register of interests has shown more than  Conservative MPs are keeping second jobs, while the government delays a clean-up of parliamentary standards. Between now and the end of January, Tory backbenchers are on course to trouser £, of outside cash, in addition to their £, MP salary, with a total of , hoursapos work. And the practice could continue beyond January  as the Prime Minister may yet kick promised reforms into the long grass. Mr Johnson pledged he would enact a major crackdown on second jobs after MPs voted for new rules last week. It will include an outright ban on political consultancy roles and that any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be within reasonable limits and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents.  But as it stands, the Standardsapos Committee is examining ideas and is not due to report to the Government until January. MPs due to take home cash include former minister Sir John Redwood. Between now and the standards committee report, he is poised to earn around £, for his role working  hoursapos a week as committee chair for the private investment firm, Charles Stanley. Another ex-frontbencher Mark Garnier is set to cream in more than £, for three second roles, one of which is listed as aposprinciple speakerapos for BRI Wealth Management. Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is due to earn around £, as aposstrategic adviserapos to Hutchison Ports Europe. And Andrew Mitchell, the former International Development Secretary, is on course to earn himself more than £, from a series of private companies, including Ernst and Young and Kingsley Capital Partners.  It comes after the Toriesapos attempt to rip up the rules and get lobbying MP Owen Paterson off the hook spectacularly backfired and left the PM open to claims of Tory sleaze. The North Shropshire MP, who has since resigned triggering a by-election, was earning more than £, from two private companies and the Standardsapos Commissioner Kathryn Stone had found he made repeated and egregious breaches of lobbying rules. The Conservatives claim that MPs should have a further right to appeal, despite a similar process being available to them via parliamentaposs standards committee. Labour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds told the Mirror: “Given how many hours these MPs are spending on their big money side hustles, constituents will wonderthey ever find any time to do the day job. “Boris Johnson has failed to properly put a stop to this racket. Labour would ban dodgy second jobs, close the revolving door on lobbying and create a genuinely independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to restore standards in public le.”The Mirror has contacted the Conservative Party for comment.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonChris GraylingPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labouraposs leader branded the PM a Covent Garden pickpocket over his broken promise that no one would have to sell their home to pay for care. After Mr Johnson claimed he had not broken his pledge - even though some families WILL have to sell up after relatives die - Sir Keir said: “People will still be forced to sell their homes to pay for care. It’s another broken promise - just like he promised he wouldn’t put up tax. Just like he promised  new hospitals. Just like he promised a rail revolution in the north. Sir Keir branded last-minute changes to a planned care cap that will save £m off the backs of poorer residents a “working class dementia tax”. And he twisted the screws over brutal Tory briefings questioning whether Mr Johnson could continue as leader - saying: Senior people in Downing Street tell the BBC it’s just not working.  Echoing the words of a TV interviewer on Monday he added: Is everything okay, Prime Minister He went on: Who knowshe’ll make it to the next election - buthe does, how does he expect anyone to take him and his promises seriously  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford added: “Has he considered calling it a day before he’s pushed out the door ” It was the second fiery PMQs in a row after Sir Keir last week called the PM a “coward” - a word the Speaker later made him withdraw. Boris Johnson was also slammed by the Speaker for accusing the Labour leader of “Mish-conduct” over a job offer from lawyers Mishcon de Reya.In a deliberate show of unity after empty benches last week, there were rowdy cheers from Tory MPs, with the Prime Minister replying: “Thank you very much”. But mocking his speech, an opposition MP shouted: Forgive me!. And Keir Starmer teased: I see they’ve turned up this week!” It comes after pressure mounted on Boris Johnson from his own party after a string of blunders, U-turns and revolts.The PM has faced anger from backbenchers over tens of billions cut from high-speed rail plans, £m a year cut from social care plans for the poor, a disastrous attempt to rip up sleaze rules, planning reforms and sewage. He then gave a speech to business leaders in which he lost his place, impersonated a car and went on a y ersion about Peppa Pig World.Dutul No civil servants issued an official government transcript of his words, which said: “Arum arum araaaaaagh.” Rumours have started that letters of no confidence have been sent to the backbench  Committee, which has the power to remove a Tory leader. One report by The Sun claimed up to a dozen letters had been submitted, while others put the number at around one or two. Anger has been heightened by a last-minute change to the £, cap on letime care payments from . If you get state help in England, only what you actually pay will count towards the cap, not your council funding.  Sir Keir said: “It’s a classic con game, a Covent Garden pickpocketing operation. The PM’s the frontman, distracting people with wild promises and panto speeches whilst his Chancellor dips his hand in their pocket.But now the PMaposs routine is falling flat. His Chancellor is worried that people are getting wise. His backbenchers say itaposs embarrassing - your words. Senior people in Downing Street tell the BBC it’s just not working. Is everything okay, Prime Minister  The PM replied: I’ll tell you what’s not working is that line of attack. Mr Johnson tried to insist people will not have to sell their home - while they are alive. The  Tory manesto pledged people wouldnapost have to sell homes to pay for care, without mentioning their death. He said: We will disregard your home as part of your assetsyou and your spouse are living in it. You can have a deferred payment agreement. But Sir Keir said a person with assets worth £k, most tied up in homes, has to pay £, and “they’d lose almost everything”. “How on earth does the Prime Minister think they can get their hands on that kind of money without selling their home  he asked. Labour analysis suggests more than  northern constituencies have an average home value under £, - the threshold at which people are affected by the change - compared to zero in the south. The PM shot back at Labour: They haven’t had the guts to fix this in all their time in government. It’s something left over from the Attlee government and we are fixing it. Meanwhile Mr Johnson claimed he would build three new high-speed lines in the north, despite the fact these are all stripped-back from his own previous plans. He said Sir Keir “actually campaigned against HS” adding: If we’d listened to Captain Hindsight we would have no HS at all… and we would all still be in lockdown. The PM said: “I took a decision that it was the right thing to do for the long term interests of the whole country. How can they possibly trust that man.” Sir Keir replied: “I think he’s lost his place in his notes again. “The only thing he’s delivering is high taxes, high prices and low growth.” The PMaposs press secretary refused to repeat the  commitment on care - or to rule out any more pledges being broken. I would just repeat what the plan is, she said, in a testy exchange with reporters. Even the PM’s angriest critics admit a leadership challenge is a long way off, as % of Tory MPs -  of them - would need to write letters. But a senior Tory told the Mirror: “He’s lost his invincibility virginity, and once you lose that you can’t get it back.” They added: “I think what seems to have dawned on a lot of people is we are more than likely looking towards a change of leader before the next election rather than  months after the next election. “It’s like amateur hour at the London Palladium - lurching from one self-inflicted c**k-up to the other.” Dominic Raab today dismissed speculation that fed up Tories want to oustBoris Johnsonas tittle tattle. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted Mr Johnson was on great form and branded growing tensions within Tory ranks over the PMaposs position as Westminster village gossip. Downing Street was forced to tell journalists yesterday that the PM is well following his chaotic speech to business leaders on Monday. Mr Raab claimed: There will always be the scrutiny, the noisiness, that comes to British politics. Frankly, overwhelmingly - and I talk to colleagues, MPs on the back benches on all sides all the time - there is huge support for what weaposre doing and what the Prime Minister is doing.In another interview, he toldBBCBreakfast: The Prime Minister is on great form.The reality is people speak about speeches in the Westminster village, the gossip and all the rest of it. Tensions have been swirling between No and Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs operation in No after the Treasury was blamed for an incendiary briefing to the BBC that there is a lot of concern inside the building about the PM and itaposs just not working. Allies of Mr Sunak denied the Treasury was involved in the briefing - but the Chancellor and PM have clashed several times over summer. Mr Raab said: Itaposs the job of Westminster commentators to pick up on one anonymous source from wherever they found it to criticise the Government of the day, thataposs fine.“Yes”. But adds “I’ve seen ious anonymous source briefings that I’m not going to go into” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON PMQs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Arthur died on June  last year aged six, after being subjected to a persistent campaign of cruelty by his Thomas Hughes, , who is currently on trial for his murder. Little Arthur was found with  areas of bruising on his body after he died from unsurvivable brain injuries in June last year, while alone with Hughesapos partner Emma Tustin, . Coventry Crown Court was told that Arthuraposs concerned grandmother Joanne Hughes, took pictures of a large bruise on his shoulder in a failed attempt to show authorities that her grandson was in danger. But she said when she called social services and offered to send the picture they didnapost want to see it. When social workers visited the following day, Ms Hughes said they recorded no concerns, and simply put the marks down to childaposs play. When social workers visited the next day, they put the marks down to aposchild playapos and recorded aposno concernsapos.  One of the social workers later told jurors that she had noticed a yellowing bruise in the middle of Arthuraposs back when she visited, and when she was later shown the picture Ms Hughes took, she was shocked at how she had failed to realise how extensive his injuries were. Recordings of a six-year-old boy crying no-one loves me and no-oneaposs gonna feed me before his death were released as the murder trial nears its end. Hughes and Tustin both deny murdering Arthur, after he suffered a fatal collapse while alone with his stepmother at her Cranmore Road home in Solihull, West Midlands, on June  last year.  The pair also face multiple counts of child cruelty, after it was alleged the boy was force-fed salt-laced meals, kept isolated in the home, starved, dehydrated and routinely beaten by the couple. The court heard Hughes sent text messages to Tustin saying to dig Arthuraposs grave, and kidaposs getting ended when I get back. Tustin has claimed Arthuraposs fatal head injury was self-inflicted, possibly by throwing himself down the staircase in her hallway, where he was forced to spend  to  hours a day as part of the coupleaposs behavioural regime.  Jurors sitting at Coventry Crown Court have heard the boy had  injuries, both old and new, all over his body, including  alone on his head and neck. He did not have his own bed and had to sleep on the lounge floor without a mattress, the court has previously heard. Prosecutors have also alleged Tustin and Hughes withheld food and drink, and when they did feed Arthur they poisoned him with salt, leaving him frail and weak.  Tustin has also accepted recording more than  audio files of Arthur, while he was being punished, claiming they were to show Hughes how his son was behaving. Two of the audio files have now been made public for the first time since the trial began last month. In one, Arthur can be heard crying and pleading: No-one loves me, repeating the phrase four times in a -second recording. In another audio file of  seconds, Arthur cries No-oneaposs gonna feed me seven times.  Arthur fatally collapsed while he and his father were staying at Tustinaposs home during the first Covid lockdown. The jury has heard from one witness who described how Arthur looked broken just a few weeks after he moved in. Video of a weakened and frail Arthur, recorded just hours before his collapse and previously played in court, was also released on Tuesday after being seen by the jury.  The footage, recorded on an internal CCTV camera in the propertyaposs lounge, shows the boy struggling to pick up and then put away his pillow and blanket after waking at .am. It takes him  seconds to get to his knees and finally his feet, with an expression of pain on his face throughout. Hughes and Tustin have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin admitted one count of child cruelty, but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences. The trial - held at Coventry Crown Court - continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Murder trialSocial servicesCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Louie Leach has been staying with Bobbi-Anne McLeodaposs mother and two siblings at their home in Plymouth, Devon as police continue to question two murder suspects. Bobbi-Anne, , was reported missing on Saturday when she did not show up to meet Louie and a group of friends at pm. Yesterday, a body was found close to the coastal path and car park above Bovisand beach - seven miles from the bus stop where the teen was last seen. Devon and Cornwall Police are continuing to search the woodland and clfs above a Devon beach for clues.  Police say that while formal identication hasnapost been carried out but Bobbi-Anneaposs were informed and are being supported by specialist officers.One of Bobbi-Anneaposs friends told the MailOnline : Louie is with Bobbi-Anneaposs family now and they are helping each other through this dficult time. They can barely speak. There are no words for the horror they are living through.Bobbi-Anne and Louie were really in love and were a wonderful couple. They had their whole lives ahead of them and now this has been cruelly taken away from Louie and itaposs crushed him.  Late last night brother, Lee, shared an image of the two of them as children and wrote: Until we meet again sis. I love you. Now go rest easy. Two men, aged  and , were arrested last night on suspicion of murder and remain in custody. Today, mourners arrived to lay flowers opposite the bus stop where Bobbi-Anne was last seen in the Leigham area of Plymouth. Many wept and hugged each other as forensic police officers were seen combing the surrounding area for clues.  The assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police Nikki Leaper said the two arrested suspects were still being questioned and they were not anticipating any charges to be brought today. In a statement read out at a press conference, she said: We are aware of the signicant level of interest in the ongoing murder investigation being run by our major crime team and I wanted to provide you with the latest information in relation to this. The two men who were arrested on suspicion of murder remain in police custody at this time.  We do not anticipate this to change throughout today as enquiries continue at a pace. Yesterday afternoon officers located the body of a woman in the Bovisand area of the South Hams after information received by police led to enquiries being carried out in the area. Formal identication hasnapost been carried out but the family of -year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod were informed of the development and they continue to be supported by specialist officers.  Officers on the ground have been and are continuing to be supported by specialist resources whilst extensive searches and forensic examination of a number of scenes is carried out. These searches are expected to continue into the coming days and the public can expect to see an increased visible police presence during that time. We apologise for any disruption these searches may cause to our communities.

This group survived the journey, but hours later a child and five women were among those who died when their boat capsized in the ­Channel’s worst-ever migrant boat disaster.PM Boris Johnson tonight said that he was “deeply saddened” by the tragedy. Migrants drag a huge inflatable across the beach to the sea, with French police watching from a pick-up as children are put on the boat for the perilous Channel crossing. The two officers did nothing to stop the dinghy setting off near the town of Wimereux just after am.  Mercully, six-and-a-half hours later it arrived on the coast near Dover, where Border Force officials were there to help. The group survived the journey on the day at least  other desperate migrants, including five women and a young girl, died attempting the same crossing. The death toll was earlier estimated to be as high as , but the French government said late on Wednesday night that its official toll was , down from . French interior minister Gerald Darmanin described the victims’ vessel as “very frail, like a pool you blow up in your garden”. Read MoreRead More French President Emmanuel Macron called for an emergency meeting of European ministers, as he vowed: “France will not let the Channel become a cemetery.” The scale of the tragedy unfolded in the afternoon when fishermen out at sea  miles north of Calais spotted bodies floating in the waves. By evening, French Coast Guard and Navy vessels had retrieved nearly  bodies and at least two survivors, with boats and helicopters searching for more.  Six people had been seen alive in the water. The British Coast Guard was helping the operation and, with more than  dinghies setting out today, officials fear other vessels could have sunk too. Four suspected traffickers were arrested and Dunkirk prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for manslaughter and “assistance with illegal immigration”. Gangs have been charging refugees more than £, for passage in inflatable dinghies, with le jackets of little use in the treacherous currents and freezing temperatures of the Channel.  The joint rescue operation was called off late tonight. Mr Darmanin said: “There are no words strong enough to describe the criminality of the smugglers.” Before todayaposs tragedy,  people had died attempting the crossing this year. More than , migrants have made the journey in November alone, the most ever in a single month. It brings the total for the year so far to more than ,, compared to , in , and , in . Britain pledged to give France £million to stop the crossings but tonight Boris Johnson, who chaired a Cobra meeting on the crisis, offered more support.He said: “The operation being conducted by our friends on the beaches, supported with £million from the UK to help patrol the beaches, the technical support we’ve been giving, they haven’t been enough. “Our offer is to increase our support and to work with our partners on the beaches concerned, on the launching grounds for these boats.”He said smugglers had to be shown “they can’t simply get people over the Channel”, or they would continue to “get away with murder”. France has refused to let UK officers work on the other side of the Channel to detect people-smuggling operations.The two French officers at the beach near Wimereux were powerless to stop the boat launching with around  families on board. The police truck flashed its lights and circled the migrants but soon gave up and went to patrol another area of beach. Home Secretary Priti Patel posted: “This Government’s New Plan for Immigration will overhaul our broken asylum system and address many of the long-standing pull factors encouraging migrants to make the perilous journey.”  But the Government is under pressure to offer safe asylum routes.Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: “The UK Government, France and the wider international community have a duty to prevent people being forced into such peril.” Enver Solomon, of the Refugee Council, called for “safe routes for those men, women and children in desperate need of protection”.British Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson said: “Everyone deserves to live in safety and it should be unacceptable to us that people have no choice but to make dangerous crossings in their search for this.” aposVictims of inevitable tragedyapos - Comment - by Jason Beattie, Mirror head of politics The deaths in the Channel were a tragedy waiting to happen.We knew that desperate people were risking their lives on a daily basis to seek a better le. And we knew they were being exploited by people smugglers.And we knew that unless something was done, it would result in the loss of lives.Politicians on both sides of the Channel pledged action but what was promised was not delivered.  In September  Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed a joint plan with France for   patrols on the beaches of northern France, greater intelligence sharing and “intense efforts” to tackle gangs. These measures, we were told, would prevent the majority of crossings by the spring of . But so far this year more than , people have crossed and we are struggling to control our borders. It is not for lack of money. The UK Government paid the French £.million in , followed by a further £million in July this year.  With some justication Britain claims France is not keeping its side of the bargain. But much of the blame lies at the door of the Government. It has all but shut the door for genuine asylum seekers. With no safe passage, those escaping bloodshed and oppression turned in desperation to criminal gangs. And now we are out of the EU we are no longer part of the Dublin agreement that states illegal migrants must be processed in the EU country they first entered. Solving this crisis requires compassion and co-operation. Both have been in short supply.

The B... iant, an offshoot of an older iant called B.., has  spike mutations in the spike protein and has been found in Botswana – where it is believed to have first emerged – as well as South Africa and Hong Kong. Only  cases of the new iant have so far been spotted through genomic sequencing but experts believe its identication in three countries suggests it could be more widespread. The single case identied in Hong Kong came from a person who had recently travelled from South Africa, sparking fears that more infections could have spread through international travel. The high number of mutations in the new iant has caused concern among the scientic community, because a number of the mutations may help the virus evade immunity.  Dr Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College who tweeted about the find, described the iantaposs combination of mutations as “horric”. Describing the new strain’s mutation profile as “really awful”, he added that it had the potential to be worse than nearly anything  about”, including the now-dominant Delta strain, which has  spike mutations. He wrote: “Export to Asia implies this might be more widespread than sequences alone would imply. Also the extremely long branchand incredibly high amount of spike mutations suggest this could be of real concern .  Worth emphasising this is at super low numbers right now in a region of Africa that is fairly well sampled, however it very very much should be monitored due to that horric spike profile .” So far, three cases have been detected in Botswana and six in South Africa. The first cases were collected in Botswana on  November. The Hong Kong case was a -year-old man who travelled to South Africa on  October and ed on  November.  He tested negative on histo Hong Kong but went on to test positive on  November while undergoing quarantine at a hotel. In South Africa, cases rose from  on Monday to more than  on Tuesday but scientists believe it is too soon to tell whether there is a link with the new “super iant”.New coronavirus iants are identied all the time and often will not spread beyond a handful of cases.There are currently no cases of the B... iant in the UK but officials and scientists at the UK Health Security Agencysaid they were monitoring and investigating the iant.  Dr Meera Chand, Covid- Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “The UK Health Security Agency, in partnership with scientic bodies across the globe, is constantly monitoring the status of SARS-CoV- iants as they emerge and develop worldwide. “As it is in the nature of viruses to mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. Any iants showing evidence of spread are rapidly assessed.” Professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London’s Genetics Institute, said the iant may have evolved during a chronic infection in an immunocompromised person, possibly an untreated HIV Aids patient.  He said: “I would definitely expect it to be poorly recognised by neutralising antibodies relative to Alpha or Delta. “It is dficult to predict how transmissible it may be at this stage. For the time being, it should be closely monitored and analysed, but there is no reason to get overly concerned, unless it starts going up in frequency in the near future.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Genetics Institute Inc.University College LondonImperial CollegeEducationSchoolsSTDsSarsCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jonathan Silcock may have just  months left to live, leaving behind new we Cha and daughter Rosaleah, four. The -year-old, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, had to process the devastating news alone at the hospital due to Covid restrictions - and now has to be fed through a tube.He had begun gruelling chemotherapy sessions immediately after diagnosis but these were stopped as the treatment was causing the cancer to grow, according to Jonathan, reports the Manchester Evening News. The dad - who also has cerebral palsy - went to his GP in February after noticing he was rapidly losing weight and regularly vomiting after eating.Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror Following a endoscopy and biopsy, he was told he had stage four pancreatic cancer. I was told it would be a few weeks before the tests came back, but it was just four days later when I got a call asking me to go in and discuss the results, Jonathan explained. He said on arrival he was met by two Macmillan nurses and knew it was cancer straight away, admitting it was a shock. I have always been in and out of hospital but I never expected the news and I immediately started worrying about what it would mean for Cha and Rosaleah. But determined not to let cancer stop him, he and Cha moved up their wedding and got married in June. Weeks after the big day he was told his cancer had spread to his bowels and oesophagus, before it was also found to have reached his lungs. This shortened his le expectancy from three years to just  months. Jonathan said: I was in and out of hospital every few weeks - sadly that is all my daughter has ever known. But they told me the cancer was spreading and I had to come off the chemo straight away which was my only treatment option. I had to go home and tell all my family the news and they just kept telling me I had been through worse and could beat this. Jonathan said doctors told him his cancer was so aggressive, but that regular scans would monitor it. I asked doctors to stop telling me when it had spread because I just didnapost want to know, he explained. It was just more bad news I didnapost want to deal with. As well as the feeding tube, Jonathan uses a wheelchair and suffers with breathlessness. We Cha has now become his full-time carer. Jonathan is determined to spend his remaining days making memories with his family so they can look back and smile. My daughter is only four and she has seen me go through all this. It just isnapost right, he said. Cha wants to go to Benidorm and Jonathan has promised Rosaleah they will take her to Disneyland. It really makes you realise how important le is and how you should always make the most of each day, he added.

He lashed out at the former office complex in the Hengrove area of the city, saying it is not fit for human habitation.Police said they were called more than  times in just over a year to the site, Bristol Live reports.Other residents, including a young mum, have also said they do not feel safe there. The parent claimed that shortly after they moved in to the apartments there was a fight in the corridor and their front door was covered in blood. He also claimed that he witnessed an attempted stabbing and said he had had problems before, including receiving threats and abuse from one of the other residents. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. I feel very unsafe and I am always worried about someone trying to come into the flat and hurt us, he said. I sleep with a hammer next to my bed just in case. It is not very nice. Caridon has said it has security on site every day and night from am until am and that, when it is busier, it has two guards on duty. The developer said guards are trained to deal with ASB and that police would have been called immediately in the case of a serious incident. The developer has said that anyone found to be causing any bother is put into a three-stage procedure starting with a warning, followed by signing an agreement with Caridon and the police and the last stage being eviction. However, it said it reviews procedures regularly and remains open to discussions about their effectiveness. Bristol City Council admitted earlier this week that the use of a former council office block in south Bristol for housing is not an ideal option - but has defended doing so, saying the site has provided housing for more than  people. In Summer , the council revealed it planned to house people in the complex which was being redeveloped by Caridon.The company was the subject of a Newsnight investigation as residents in one of their developments in London complained about overcrowding and the mix of people, speaking about violence and substance misuse.The dad also claimed the family have made more than a hundred complaints to Caridon about the site, including about drugs and violence, but he says that nothing has been done. The resident described the noise at the site as awful and claimed they have found drug needles outside their window before, adding that they have been without hot water or heating for several months now and are having to rely on personal heaters to keep the flat warm. The dad said they feel they never had a choice about whether they wanted to live at Imperial Apartments or not, adding he feels he is battling the council and Caridon to escape the development. He continued: We moved in thinking this would be temporary accommodation, for a maximum of a year, and that we would then be moved somewhere , but it turns out the contract just keeps rolling. We are trying to get them to move us but they [the council] are saying we are adequately housed. Since we moved in, my partneraposs mental health has gone downhill drastically and I feel constantly paranoid that someone is going to come in and hurt us.  It is not fit for human habitation - it is disgusting. It has been like living in hell. They sold us something nice, but in the end it turned out to be our worst nightmare. Caridon has said that Imperial Apartments provide residents with the opportunity to manage an independent tenancy and that, for those that choose to move, it will provide landlord references. The developer said it has only had a handful of tenants that have chose to leave and that the vast majority are very happy at the property and are a positive part of our community, adding that many of its tenants were at risk of becoming homeless and have now found a permanent home at the site. Caridon said that tenant safety is a primary concern and that the private gated development has an extensive amount of cameras, together with front desk security and concierge services. A young mum who has been living in a two-bedroom flat at Imperial Apartments since the end of last year described the situation as appalling. The resident - who is in her s and has a one-year-old child - claimed she experienced serious harassment from another tenant and that the police advised her not to be there because of this. She continued: The person is still living there, he has been moved to a dferent part of the building but he knows where I am. I feel very unsafe there and my mental health has been seriously affected by what is going on. I have been feeling depressed, anxious and scared. I am feeling mentally drained. The mum said she is now on medication for her depression, adding she has been staying at friendsapos houses as she doesnapost want to be at Imperial Apartments anymore. Caridon has said it will reach out to the tenant immediately and offer all the support it can to seek a solution where possible. She said there are lots of young mums living at the development and that, when she was housed there she was told it would be perfect for her and her child as, for instance, the site has a soft play area. The mum - who signed a one year contract - claimed the whole building is in a disgusting condition. I do not think any family with children should be housed here, she continued. I think it is very unsafe for children to be in this kind of atmosphere. I thought I would be able to go where but I am now on a monthly rolling tenancy until I find somewhere to move to. Caridon has said it has a strict referral criteria in place for the building and conducts a risk assessment on all tenants to assess suitability, adding all tenants are offered aposassured shorthold tenanciesapos and that the option to live at the site is choice based. The developer said it has worked very closely with the council in building a safe and thriving community and has heavily invested in breakout spaces and facilities. Caridon said: We pride ourselves on customer service and treating all our tenants with respect. Since Imperial Apartments launched we have done our utmost to really listen to resident feedback with many of their recommendations being put in place. They wanted more onsite amenities which we have provided with our soft play area and children’s playground, for example. We have four communal rooms fitted with flat screen TVs, yoga mats and fitness equipment and all areas are cleaned daily by our full-time cleaner.

Unless they’re popping in to let their colleagues have a cuddle with their newborns, parents don’t take their babies into work.MP Stella Creasy had other ideas. On Tuesday she took her three-month-old son to a debate in Westminster Hall. Much to her fury she was told this isn’t allowed. She immediately took to Twitter to complain, saying: “Apparently Parliament has a written rule which means I can’t take my well behaved -month-old, sleeping baby when I speak in the chamber... Mothers in the mother of all parliament are not to be seen or heard it seems…” Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked for the rules to be reviewed and said it was “extremely important” for all parents to participate in the House. He did, however, point out they have a nursery. Many people, me included, can’t understand why Stella took her baby in at all  Was it to get a pic for Instagram She says she had to come in because, as an MP, while she’s entitled to maternity leave, she doesn’t have anyone covering her role to the detriment of her constituents.But as an MP on £, a year, couldn’t she get a baby-sitter  She can’t have it both ways. No one  does. Not the bus driver, police officer or shop worker. And they earn nowhere near £,.  As a working mum myself, I welcome all conversations about improving work for mothers. But unlike Stella, most of us working mums don’t have the luxury of being able to pick and choose when we bring our children to work. Most of us juggle work with the lion’s share of ­childcare and we do it without grand gestures or wanting a medal. The rules of the Commons are peculiar, but they only affect a handful of women. Meanwhile the UK still has the third highest childcare costs for wealthy countries, according to the OECD. Some mothers don’t go back to work while their children are little because it’s so expensive. Others have no choice. So while it’s important for Stella to take a stand in her little corner of the world, it would be greatshe could go beyond Westminster on this one.

Image: Anita Maric   SWNSByAdam DuttonAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsA aposlaid backapos one-year-old dog was rushed to the vet when she ate cannabis leaves - just months after she swallowed a splf on the same walk. Bedlington Terrier Holly fell ill hours after wolfing down cannabis leaves that had been dumped under a bush around Calf Heath Reservoir near Cannock. Worried owner David Wiliams recognised the half-digested leaves and rushed her to the vet who gave her anti-drug injection. Incredibly, it was just four months after Holly needed tablets to flush out her system after she ate a half-smoked cannabis joint on her daily walkies. David, , from Cannock, Staffs., said: Iaposd taken her for her usual walk and let her off and sheaposd gone snfing behind a bush.  I called her back and when we got in the car she didnapost look right and she smelled strange. I recognised it as cannabis because weaposve had a lot of anti-social behaviour around here so I know what cannabis smells like. When she brought up the leaves it confirmed suspicions and I took her to the vet again. I just couldnapost believe it had happened so soon after she swallowed the cannabis joint. “My friends and family joke that Holly’s got a drug problem.  “I have to say, she is a very laid back dog anyway but this time she was off her legs. We actually think sheaposd make a very good snfer dog. “Four months ago she got ill after swallowing a discarded cannabis joint. We took her to the vets and they gave her tablets. “This time she’d obviously eaten too much of the drug and she needed an injection and we were told to check her regularly overnight. Holly’s latest brush with cannabis happened while David took her on a walk around Calf Heath Reservoir near Cannock on November . David, who has one grown-up son and lives with we Jonanne, , reported it to police and is now warning other dog owners about the dangers of discarded drugs.  He added: “Dog walkers need to be extra cautious, I won’t be going down there again. “My we was horried when me and Holly got home. She’s her little baby and she was so sick.” A spokesperson for Staffordshire Police said: “A man reported that his dog had found and consumed cannabis left along a lane leading to Calf Heath Reservoir on  November. “Police issued the man with safety advice and told him that the local council is responsible for removal of any waste products.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Staffordshire PoliceDrugsDogscannabisTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He told Closer magazine : “I really wouldn’t be surprisedthey’re planning another Oprah interview. Harry and Meghan have caused chaos and I suspect there’s no stopping them.“I can totally see more of these high-profile, Hollywood-style interviews with A-list TV hosts happening. Especiallythere’s lots of money being offered for it. “Harry will need promotion for his memoir, due to be released next autumn, too. Another Oprah interview,it’s anything like the last, would surely push the royals to breaking point.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

The couplehas reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham for the festive period.It would be the first chance for Royal Family to meet Lilibet, the Queenaposs namesake great-granddaughter, who the couple welcomed in June.Meghan and older son Archie have yet toto the UK since they left for the US last year. The Queen has faced a number of health concerns in recent weeks, after being hospitalised for a night in October and then having to cancel her appearance at the Remembrance Day service after spraining her back.  But a sourcetold Page Six: “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming.“If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims.

Kate donned a vibrant pink coat and matching jumper, thought to be from Hobbs, with dark trousers and heels for the visit and wore her hair in long waves. The Year  science lesson Kate joined was looking at a research project run by Oxford University, which looks to embed the key principles of early childhood development and neuroscience in students. The visit comes after Kate launched The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood this summer, which aims to drive awareness of the extraordinary impact of the early years. Over the last ten years, she has spent time looking into how challenges in later le such as addiction, family breakdown, poor mental health, suicide and homelessness can have their roots in the earliest years of someone’s le. Through her work with The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, she is said to be aiming to highlight how what we experience in early childhood shapes the developing brain, which is why positive relationships, environments and experiences during this period are so crucial.

And to have the Duchess leading on it is a big deal,” they said. “Naturally most royal programming goes automatically to the BBC as the national broadcaster. Now it looks like they will work more with ITV in the future.” The source added ITV were “very surprised but delighted” to the call offering them the show. Kensington Palace declined to comment when contacted by the Mirror about the carol concert. The Mirror has also contacted the BBC for comment. Last week, Kate made a glamorous appearance at the Royal Variety Performance, where she wore a stunning recycled green gown by Jenny Packham for the occasion.

Keith Turner, , and Rita Trickett, , decided to tie the knot in a tearful ceremony after  years together. Unfortunately, Keith was admitted to the Royal Derby Hospital a week ago after his condition started to worsen and it became clear he had a limited time left with his loved ones. Sister, Amanda Broad, helped to arrange the special day. Amanda said: “Our ACP Louisa made a wedding cake and the team provided a bouquet of flowers for the bride. “A pinhole flower was also made for the groom too as well as a buffet and decorations all provided by our staff.  “I was extremely privileged to be asked to be a witness and although it was my day off I was so happy to be there on their special day. “It was also a lovely surprise for me to receive a bouquet of flowers and a lovely card for what I had done. “It’s times like this when you realise how le can be so short and I have made one of their last wishes happen, which to me is an extreme privilege.” The couple, who live in Mackworth, near Derby, met through their work for the Red Cross in . Keith said: “Rita was one of the executive officers at the time and was my we’s best friend. When my we passed away from cancer, Rita was there to look after me and we’ve been together ever since. “However, the thought of getting married never was on our mind. I didn’t care too much about labels and we’re both quite independent people.  “It was only when I became more ill that I thought it was time to ask her to marry me, and she said yes.” Keith has been diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer, and his condition worsened after suffering from a bleed over the weekend. Rita is also a patient at the hospital, recovering from a stroke but is feeling much better and has now been discharged. She said: “This is the longest time we’ve been apart for years, it’s been horrible.” Keith has asked to be taken off treatment once the wedding is complete. Rita added: “It’s what he wants and I agree with him, he’s had enough and is tired.”  The ceremony took place in the day room at the side of ward , with some staff even visiting after their sht to send the couple their well wishes. Rita’s granddaughter, Emma Burd, , attended the ceremony along with hospital staff on the wards to celebrate the special day with the two. Emma said: “It’s been stressful. However, the ward staff have been amazing. Amanda is a star, both medically and personally. We’re eternally grateful.” Ward sister Nicola Salt took photos of the ceremony to help create a lasting memory of the day for the pair. Nicola said: “Sister Amanda did an absolutely amazing job at pulling everything together as well as the team to create a special moment that can be cherished. “It was emotional and had the team in tears but we’re all so proud.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON HospitalsLoveMarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But Zara’s husband Mike Tindall has shared some adorable details about the big day, which saw the babies baptised in front of their great-grandmother the Queen. The ceremony, which took place at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park, was held in honour of Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank’s son August and Zara and Mike’s eight-month-old Lucas. And speaking on his podcast, The Good, The Bad  The Rugby, former rugby player Mike revealed how everyone attending had a “lovely day”.He told co-presenter Alex Payne: I had a great weekend, a great few days.  We had the christening on Sunday, it was lovely. It was a lovely day. Alex then asked Mikeyoung Lucas had enjoyed his dunking in the holy water when he was christened. And Mike revealed: “He did actually. I took him swimming in the morning, I think I readied him for it, he was quite looking forward to it.” The Queen attended the christening ceremony on Sunday after she pulled out of a string of public events in recent weeks.

It is thought it was the first time two royal babies were christened together. Eugenie wore a silk white dress featuring embroidered detail, a headband and a blue pendant necklace, while Jack wore a navy suit, crisp white shirt and light blue, patterned tie. Zara opted for a black outfit and dangling pearl earrings as she drove herself to the venue. Mike, , arrived in a separate vehicle dressed in a blazer.  On Monday, a day after the christening, the sad news was revealed that Jack’s father, George, died just days before the ceremony.The -year-old suffered from Covid last year and had been unwell for some time.A royal insider told MailOnline : George had been in hospital with Covid and had not been the same after that.”While another said that it was wonderful for George to have been alive to see nine-month-old August born in February.

She was described as very frightened and nervous when she arrived in July but has started to come out of her shell. However, living in kennels has left her stressed and it is hoped she can find a permanent home before Christmas. In a post on Facebook, Oakwood said: “How has Epiphany been with us  days and still no viewings “Not only is Epiphany absolutely stunning but she has a larger than le personality and is a true bundle of fun! She who loves running around and playing with toys, she also enjoys a fuss once she knows you. She has lots of potential and is a beautul dog. Epiphany needs an owner with a lot of time and patience to help her build up her confidence with people and certain other dogs. The post continued: Epiphany is too nervous to be placed with younger children and needs a mature home. She can be selective about her doggy friends so would be best with a very calm male that will not pester her. She does enjoy the company of other dogs and could live with a male dog and children  years and over. Epiphany will need to live in a home with ft secure fencing and someone who can supervise her in the garden as she has been known to make escape attempts.If youaposre interested in rehoming Epiphany, or any other dogs in Oakwoodaposs care, visit their website.

Yet, some people are worried that with gradual rising cases, ato restrictions could be possible in similar circumstances to last year.An increase in cases around Europe has also led to fears surrounding tighter rules in the UK. Austria went into a -day lockdown on Monday and German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted the country was suffering amid a fourth wave with around , cases every day.While cases are high, the UK did not have such an extensive vaccination programme when it entered lockdown restrictions around this time last year.But what would a Christmas lockdown look like, and is it actually on the cards  Will there be a lockdown at Christmas  There is unlikely to be a lockdown at Christmas from what government guidance and ministers have said. Though officially not ruling anything out, meaning that it is indeed possible, the government would be extremely unwilling to re-enter a lockdown face due to the nature of the restrictions. Bars and restaurants would have to be shut, causing a potential crisis in the hospitality sector with finances having suffered in the past year.  The economy would take a hit too and these are dferent circumstances from last year as we have a vaccine. People are currently being encouraged to take up their booster jab. Scientists are currently not necessarily backing a full lockdown either. Epidemiologist Nigel Ferguson, whose modelling helped the first lockdown in place last year, said: I think it is unlikely we will get anything close to what we had last year, that catastrophic winter wave.We might see slow increases as we did in October, for instance, but not anything as rapid as we saw last year, he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.How many cases would there need to be before a lockdown is enforced  Currently, there is no plan for a full lockdown and no set figure in place for the UK to enforce a full lockdown.However, the governmentaposs contingency Covid Plan B has not been completely ruled out, although health secretary Sajid Javid has been keen to play down rumours of it.It would depend on a signicant rise in cases, perhaps even a disastrous one.  Last month, Javid told LBC: Itaposs getting darker, we can see itaposs getting colder, we will spend more time indoors, and so we should think about hand hygiene, about getting tested regularly, especiallyyouaposre going to meet your more vulnerable... perhaps an elderly relative or someone - sowe can do all that, Iaposm sure that weaposre going to have a great Christmas.A lockdown would depend more so onthe NHS is becoming overwhelmed. Organisations like doctors’ and NHS groups have argued the health service is close to breaking point due to the backlog of elective care.Why hasnapost Boris Johnson introduced a lockdown already The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he could see nothing in the data that suggested the country needs to switch to plan B measures.Of the rise in cases on mainland Europe, he said: We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will wash up on our shores, but history shows we cannot afford to be complacent.  Plan B measures should, in theory, help bring cases in down, which are expected to go up in the winter as it is darker and colder. This means people tend to spend more time with each other indoors, rather than out and about, which would increase chances of the virus spreading. Under the measures, masks would become compulsory in indoor public spaces , and mandatory vaccine passports would be introduced in England for nightclubs and indoor settings with  or more people. Currently, the government seem confident that the rollout of the booster jab will help combat any surge in cases and prevent plan B measures.

Charles’ romance with Camilla during his marriage to Diana has been part of royal gossip for decades and that his first love was never the Princess of Wales who was forced to suffer in silence for much of the time.It is a version that was also pushed by the Netflix series The Crown where he was seen heading off to meet up with Camilla and Diana was left crying at home.But this take on the marriage has been disputed by a former protection officer who said that Diana first had other love interests. Allan Peters has claimed that Charles began his romance with Camilla again after he found out that Diana was having an affair with another protection officer, the late Barry Mannakee.  Peters also said that he was the one to tell Charles of Diana’s relationship with Mannakee. The popular perception is that the Prince of Wales was straying all the way through his marriage — and that is definitely, unequivocally, not the case, Peters told CNN. The first person that strayed was the Princess. He went back to see Mrs Parker Bowles after he learned about her affair with Mannakee. Diana’s affair with Mannakee is believed to have started in  during a fishing trip to Balmoral. Then a year later he was moved to the Diplomatic Protection Squad where he died aged  in a crash. The version from Peters that Diana strayed first was also claimed by Jonathan Dimbleby in his authorised biography of Charles published in . Peters told CNN: I started to notice her behaviour was unusual whenever we were anywhere near Mannakee, so I decided to talk to her about it. For the first  minutes, she categorically denied it. But then she told me exactly what was going on: she was having some sort of relationship with Mannakee. He said that Charles asked him why Diana was acting dferently, and Peters told CNN that he replied that he had better speak to her about it. “Well, I’ve tried all that, and the only thing that seems to be upsetting her is that Barry Mannakee is going back to unorm. And,she’s that upset, Barry can stay, Peters claims Charles told him. At that stage, I was forced to say: aposWell, Sir,he stays, then I’m afraid I’ll have to leave.apos And, I think, at that point the penny dropped. He was utterly shocked and was clearly very upset.

In recent years, there has been a string of fictionalised TV shows and films about the Royal Family ranging from The Crown on Netflix to Princess Diana movie Spencer. It’s never been confirmedthe likes of the Queen or Kate Middleton have actually sat down in front of their TVs to watch these dramas. But according to Ken Wharfe, a former royal protection officer who worked for Princess Diana from  to , the royals do indeed love to watch these types of TV shows and movies.He told OK! : The royals love that stuff. They will watch it and they have no fear of that. They’re watching it to see how true it is or how untrue it is.However, some of these shows, especially The Crown have recently come under fire, with their historical accuracy called into question. And Ken added: Peter Morgan [creator of The Crown] has said himself that this isn’t a documentary of truthful facts. Some of it is truthful and some of it has a license to draw people in.

But one thing’s for certain, Diana didn’t roller skate around Buckingham Palace.” The Crown season five will be released on Netflix in  with filming for it currently underway.The new episodes will focus on the royals during the s - one of their most turbulent times in recent history.The early s saw the breakdown of the marriages of Prince Charles and Diana as well as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.There was also a devastating fire at Windsor Castle in , which the Queen dubbed her annus horribilis. Later in the decade, Diana gave her famous BBC Panorama interview, where she talked about Charlesaposs relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.And in , she tragically died aged  following a car crash, leaving the world completely heartbroken.Season five of the show will see wholesale changes to The Crown cast with the role of the Queen falling to BAFTA winner Imelda Staunton, who takes over from Olivia Colman.The Two Popes star Johnathan Pryce will portray Prince Philip and is taking over from Tobias Menzies. Meanwhile, the coveted role of Princess Diana has been given to Elizabeth Debicki, who takes the part from previous actress Emma Corrin. However, speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, royal historian Anne Whitelock said the new season of the show might not be something the royals want to watch when it is released. She said: If the Royal Family have found The Crown uncomfortable viewing up until now, this season is not going to give them any respite.  However, Prince Harry confessed earlier this year he has watched the show - and says it is more accurate than people think.During an interview with James Corden, he explained it is loosely based on the truth. He added: They donapost pretend to be news, itaposs fictional but itaposs loosely based on the truth. Of course itaposs not strictly accurate, but loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything , what can come from that. I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my we or myself.

Ms Wood said she went for a Ploughmanaposs sandwich which she picked from the reduced section at around pm before continuing her journey.She said she had half of the sandwich shortly after she arrived home, and then left the other half in the fridge, Nottinghamshire Live reports. It was not until  minutes later when she reached to the remaining half in the packaging that she noticed the shocking discovery. Ms Wood added: My two-year-old wanted to taste it so I grabbed it from the fridge and when I saw it I started heaving - I was physically sick. It was a big caterpillar crawling out of the sandwich and out of the packaging. I never had a problem before so it was a shock for sure.

Staff at the Etruria Road supermarket in Hanley, Stoke, which is due to shut in , were handed flyers advertising two Christmas parties running from midday to pm and .pm to .pm on  December. The flyer states: The sittings are an hour long. Whatever time you use over your break you will need to either make up or have as unpaid. Please inform us of your decision. As workers only get  minutes as a break, they must either work longer to cover the hour-long Christmas party or lose money. Shoppers and former Sainsbury’s employees said the decision by the “Scrooge” like bosses was “ludicrous”. One former worker said: This is a pretty shabby way to treat people who are about to lose their jobs.” Businesswoman Lynn Shemirani, , of Tittensor, told StokeOnTrent Live : “It’s a bit harsh. It’s going back to Scrooge with that sort of behaviour.“At Christmas time they should show a bit of goodwill, especially after working through the pandemic as front-line workers.” Retired John Hannon, , said: It’s ridiculous. The staff are pretty decent in here and they’ve been loyal to the company. I think the company ought to show them a bit of loyalty.” Chloe Edwards, , of Bucknall, added: “It’s just not fair. You’re a number - not a person.” Sainsbury’s has been contacted for comment but the store has since reportedly changed its policy.  According to the Sun, a spokesperson for Sainsburyaposs said: We have listened to our colleagues’ feedback and will be updating the plans at our Hanley store to ensure all colleagues can enjoy their Christmas celebrations during their break.Last month, the boss of Sainsburyaposs warned that shoppers may have less choice when doing their food shopping over the festive period.In an open letter to customers, Sainsburyaposs chief executive Simon Roberts said: I’m writing to let you know what we’re doing at Sainsbury’s to help you plan and manage your Christmas budget.

Mum-of-two Alana Norman, , lived in a two-bedroom flat in Arnold, Nottingham and was part of the Mother and Baby Unit. The accommodation was provided by Framework and says she paid £, per month for the property.Framework has said they addressed Alanaaposs concerns within two weeks of being notied and did not receive any further correspondence, NottinghamshireLive reports. In , Alana applied to move into the flat through Framework for accommodation when she was a single mum at  and still lived with her own mother and two siblings.  Alana says she was excited to move into her own place but says she had an awful experience and wanted to leave within a month of living there. She said: The whole time I lived there, there was a lot of mould - I raised this on a number of occasions and some damp traps were brought round, and that was it. The mould made me and my first child very ill - I was pregnant and had my second child towards the end of living there too. My first daughter was one-and-a-half years old when we moved in, and some of the sentimental stuff has been ruined by the mould, I have nothing left of her being a baby.  All the bedroom furniture had mould on it, so I got rid of it to be told I was in breach of tenancy as I was told the furniture could have gone somewhere . Her close friend Saskia King, , who also lived in the same block of flats at the same time said she saw them become ill because of the mould. However, Alana did not go to a doctor about the issue. Alana and her family moved out in March .  Dave Newmarch, Frameworkaposs Corporate Services Director, said: Alana made us aware of damp and mould in her bathroom early in January . We responded, undertook treatment, and completed the work within a fortnight - well within our timescales for such work. We have no record of any further correspondence relating to this. We take all safeguarding reports seriously and are confident that any matter that was raised such as the one described would have been addressed at the time.

Market stalls, brass bands, a pipe band, the Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra and Santa were the main features and it had been hoped the event would bring some much-needed cheer to the community.  However, organisers admitted defeat in their bid to stage it. In a statement, the Prestwick Business Associationsaid: “It is with the heaviest of hearts that the PBA has been faced with having to take a hard decision to cancel the “Prestwick Lights Up Christmas” events planned for Sunday, November . “We have faced many obstacles which have been placed in front of us by South Ayrshire Council and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance which we have tried to overcome at every turn. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.“But we have learned that Police Scotland have also objected to the Market on the grounds that the Market would cause congestion along the Main Street and also the increased security level across the UK. “It seems South Ayrshire Council just do not want anyone having a Christmas event. “We are sorry that, once again, in spite of our best endeavours, there will be no light up at Christmas or the Christmas Market.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter speculates the organisers, retailers and public have been dealt a raw deal. He told AyrshireLive: “It is very disappointing that it has come to this. This is one of the most important community events in Prestwick for both local businesses and the public. “The event was organised with the safety of the public at the front and centre of all planning. “The police and council were invited to participate in the early planning of the event and having the rug pulled from under it at the last minute are hugely disappointing. Ayrshire Live contacted Police Scotland for a comment but they declined. However, it’s understood that during discussions with the local authority, they raised safety concerns relating to the use of Main Street as it is the main route in and out of town. A council spokesperson cited the recent change in status in the terrorist threat level as one of their main concerns – along with the possibility of Covid transmissions. The spokesperson said: “The safety of the public is always our top priority. “In light of the ongoing Covid- situation and recent changes to the terrorist threat level, we have been in discussions with event organisers about their safety measures. Police Scotland also had safety concerns about the proposed Prestwick Christmas Market.” It comes as the Christmas markets in Bath, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow George Square were already cancelled this year.In Bath, organisers cited Covid concerns and recruitment issues caused by Brexit meant it could not be safely managed.In Glasglow, a Christmas market will still be in St Enoch’s Square this year.

As such many may find themselves taking it out on the doctoraposs receptionist or assuming they are being rude when they are actually just really busy.A former doctoraposs receptionist has recently lted the lid on what itaposs really like to work in this role and shared some of the biggest mistakes patients can make. Speaking to Fabulous, Richard Kellow, who now works as a hypnotherapist at Kellow Hypnotherapy, told how the job is non-stop all day and the receptionist does so much more than just answering the phones.G et the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.He said: It was non-stop from the moment we switched on the phones in the morning. As well as booking appointments, weaposd type referral letters from doctors to specialists and do the filing. Weaposd also liaise with the couriers who collected the blood and urine samples taken, and then weaposd process prescriptions and have to keep the waiting room tidy. Theyaposd also have to deal with patients demanding to see the doctor quicker and assuming the receptionist was making them wait just for fun. Sometimes people felt that we just didn’t want them to see the doctor - asit was our choice when they would get medical attention or maybe we were just making them wait for the fun of it, Richard recalled. In reality, it would make our le so much easierwe could get everyone through as quickly and smoothly as possible. He went on to say how dealing with rude patients was the most dficult part of the job, as when people get stressed they often refuse to listen to logic or reason. As such people often committed some major faux pas towards the receptionists - including making personal comments about their image, booking appointments and then not turning up and making demands to see a doctor. These are the biggest mistakes a patient can make according to Richard, as well as assuming the receptionist is being rude, when really they are just doing their job. Remember that they are there to help and not hinder you, he added. Sometimes it’s easier for us to put our head down and get on with the job. It doesn’t mean we are ignoring you or being rude, it’s just quicker for us to get on and get you seen.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Moscow’s forces are being equipped with deadly “flame-thrower” rockets capable for sending a ball of fire four miles ahead of troops to devastate defending forces. On Wednesday Shoigu told Russian military leaders their top priority must now be: “Increasing their combat effectiveness, maintaining the combat readiness of nuclear forces and strengthening the potential of non-nuclear deterrent forces.”  He told them this was in retaliation for “growing NATO activity near the Russian borders,” in recent weeks, referring to claims US long-range bombers had buzzed the country’s borders. And he warned Russia will react by equipping the military with “high precision weapons, effective means of destruction, modern weapons and equipment.” It is believed Russia has put NATO and Ukraine commanders on a state of near-permanent high-alert regarding the possibility of an invasion deliberately.  This was to both lessen the impact of an actual invasion, as it has been long-expected, and also to induce a sense of repetition so he can take them by surprise when orhe issues the order to attack. In  his troops annexed Crimea in a lightning operation with barely a shot fired, having paved the way with anti-west propaganda for several years. This meant locals were less angered and in many case openly towards the presence of Russian forces when they arrived.  During daily fighting along the Ukraine border with Russia since  around , people are thought to have been killed. It is believed Russian forces are keen to push back the front line further into Ukraine to garner nationalist support back home and strike a decisive victory for local Moscow-backed separatists. Another theory of Putin’s battle-plan is that he will risk all by sending troops in a pincer movement deep into Ukraine by rolling in from Crimea and Belarus. One Russia analyst told the Daily Mirror: “The terrying picture now emerging, is that in mid-winter mass Russian forces would invade Ukraine through Belarus in the north and up through Crimea in the south, heading towards the capital Kiev, an encirclement operation, splitting the country in two.”  The expert said the timing of mid-December for an attack would mean the numerous waterways in central Ukraine would be frozen over. This would mean military bridges would not have to be erected and an advance could proceed at high speed. By sealing a military deal with neighbouring Belarus Russian President Vladimir Putin has ensured his troops can access Ukraine via Belarus. It is believed the Kremlin’s war in eastern Ukraine is costing Russia billions of pounds every year, whilst the Russian economy has tanked in the past year. Western sanctions against Moscow have crippled its economy.

It forms part of a wider poundm investment into neurodegenerative diseases which devastate so many families across the Borders.ldquoI am proud to have played a part in pushing for this investment.

Some have been boycotted for refusing to apologise orthe apology is deemed insufficient.Her apology came more than a week after Dior was attacked over the photo at its exhibition in Shanghai, which pictured a model of Asian descent with tanned, freckled skin and darkened eyelids, holding a Dior purse.Critics deemed the photograph contrary to east Asian beauty standards of fair skin and said it perpetuated Western stereotypes of Asian faces, such as slanted eyes.At least one photo editor has praised her work in the past for creating an aesthetic that was aping neither Western magazines nor Japanese and South Korean ones. In , the Global Times described Chen as Chinarsquos answer to US photographer Annie Leibovitz, calling her a ldquoshining star with a unique perspective..removeDior removed the photograph, adding that it was part of an art project and not an advertisement. In a statement on its Chinese social media account, Dior said it ldquorespects the feelings of Chinese people and ldquostrictly abides by Chinese laws and regulations.Other luxury brands have previously been embroiled in controversies in China. In , a Dolce  Gabbana advertisement sparked public outrage after the Asian model in the ad was instructed to eat spaghetti and pizza with a pair of chopsticks. The videos were later removed.The photograph taken down from the Shanghai exhibit was shot in a similar style to a series of covers Chen did for British fashion magazine i-D that featured  young Chinese women from dferent ethnic minorities. Many of the women did not fit what has become a common definition of beauty in China mdash some had small eyes and others had freckles.Ding Yining, a photo editor at Sixth Tone, praised Chenrsquos work in a  article for the state-backed English-language features website.ldquoFrom her works, it would seem that Chen prefers female models with narrow, single-lidded eyes and a sense of traditional east Asian elegance, Ding wrote.Chen told Sixth Tone that ldquoas a professional visual artist, I believe that I should help more people recognise the face of modern Chinese beauty with greater confidence..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Chinese photographer apologises over  uinsulting u images as Dior pulls picture"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-say-today-covid-update-new-rules-introduced","story":"Nicola Sturgeon gave her weekly Covid update to Parliament today, during which she announced small scale changes to the vaccine passport scheme.However, these changes are not the anticipated expansion of the vaccine passport scheme, which the Scottish government has decided not to go ahead with.Last week, the first minister warned that vaccine passportscould be required in more venues like cinemas and theatres to help curb the spread of the virus over winter.But in todays announcement, sheconfirmedthat the Scottish government had decided expanding the scheme would not be necessary, instead announcing small changes to the current system which was introduced in October.Heres what we learned from Nicola Sturgeons Covid update today....

During that time, they provide habitat for wildle, capture carbon from the atmosphere, stabilise ground that is often unsuitable for other uses and reduce water run-off that can cause erosion.With estimated sales of in excess of seven million real trees sold in the UK every year, itrsquos clear that forestry also provides much-needed rural employment.You donrsquot need to worry about deforestation either: Christmas trees are a renewable resource, generally grown as a crop with up to  trees being planted for every two-metre tree that is cut down, ensuring that the environmental benefits of woodland are maintained and potentially even improved.As the seedling grows into a tree, itrsquos clear that real trees make positive benefits to our environment but once that tree leaves the forest or the nursery, your choices begin to matter.How can you help the environment  The first step is easy: buy a Scottish-grown tree from a local business and you minimise the carbon miles from the forest to your home.Most reputable garden centres in the area should be able to offer you a Scottish-grown tree, but other outlets may not. We recommend that you check the source before you buy!But itrsquos what happens to the tree after Christmas where you can make a real dference. Research shows that the way in which the tree is disposed of has considerably dferent environment effects.At one end of the spectrum, landfill is the worst possible solution for disposing of your Christmas tree, since decomposition and the release of methane negatively impact on the environment. Surprisingly, even burning the tree is preferable to landfill as that reduces potential emissions by over  per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, one of the most environmentally friendly solutions is to reuse the tree by chipping it for mulch or to compost it.Chipping simply accelerates the plant cycle that would occur naturally on the forest floor.This non-chemical process helps the tree break down more quickly than it otherwise would in the forest, naturally ing fibre and nutrients to the soil.Local authorities often offer a collect and chip service, and East Lothian Council have done so for a number of years now.Articial treesArticial trees, it is argued, are environmentally friendly because they can be re-used year after year and, for many, itrsquos the ideal solution for reasons of practicality and convenience. In fact, the key to determining whether an articial or a real tree is more environmentally friendly lies in the number of times you use the articial tree. Letrsquos consider the factors.Most articial trees are manufactured in China using plastic, PVC and metal, and these are then shipped to consumers around the world.The materials used in production and the global shipping distances involved in delivery combine to result in a considerable negative environmental impact from articial trees.And whilst the tree can be reused year after year, there still remains the problem of disposal at the end of its le articial trees are not recyclable and inevitably end up in landfill.According to the Carbon Trust, the carbon footprints for a m tree are:l Articial tree ndash kgl Real tree to landfill ndash kgl Real tree, chipped ndash .kg.Therefore, their advice is that you need to re-use your articial tree more than  times to equal the carbon footprint of a real tree that is responsibly disposed of. Many articial trees are not built to last that long and soyou decide that an articial tree is best for your lestyle, try to buy one that genuinely can be reused over at least  years.In conclusionCaring for our environment is a complex matter, andit only involved a single issue ndash such as the carbon footprint figures above ndash decisions would be easy. But itrsquos rarely that simple you only need to think about the many iables mentioned in this article to understand the complexity of the decisions we all have to make.We hope that this article offers you a brief overview that will help you decide which type of tree is best for you.As always, our plant team are happy to discuss the options with you and help you decide what tree ndash real or articial ndash is best for you.Theyrsquore also able to explain how you can get the very best from your tree and enjoy it throughout the Christmas season."},{"url":null,"title":"paralympian-leads-opening-brewerys-brand-new-visitor-experience","story":"Paralympic Games medallist Maria Lyle, who lives in Dunbar, was joined by members of Dunbar

To reduce the impact of this, the closures will be restricted to am to .pm which should enable school transport to operate with a minimum of disturbance.Outwith the road closure times traffic will be restricted to using one side of the road and will be controlled by temporary traffic lights which will result in delays during busier periods.A ersion route will be in place via the Aand the B from St Andrews Primary School to the First Churchill Barrier.Stagecoach has advised that during the hours of am – :pm, the X commercial service from St Margarets Hope to Kirkwall will ert via the Kirkwall to Deerness road past St Andrews Primary School to the First Barrier and on to St Margaret’s Hope as per the existing timetable. Due to the change of route and possible disruptions, OIC asks passengers to allow   minutes on current scheduled times as there are likely to be delays.During the period of closure, there will be an additional X service in operation from Kirkwallas per the current timetable which will serve as far as St Marys and back for passengers residing in the Holm area. Therefore, the pick up  drop off point for passengers will be from Park of Ayre and therefore there will be no service between the First Barrier and Park of Ayre during the period of closure.Posters notying passengers of the ersions will be placed on the X service, Kirkwall Travel Centre and affected bus shelters. It should be noted that passengers can track buses across Orkney on the Stagecoach App which would provide accurate timings.OIC apologises for the inconvenience this will cause during the period of road closure. For further information on the X timetable during this time please contact Stagecoach on   or visitwww.orkney.gov.uk transport for timetable information.As for the council#s flagstone repairs, the works on John Street have been completed, with all barriers and signs now removed and the section reopened, today, Friday, November .In Victoria Street, from Bank Lane towards its junction with Ferry Road at the fountain works have been completed and reinstatements are curing with barriers expected to be removed next week.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

Elsewhere, security officers check vaccination certicates before letting customers head towards the steaming sausages and kebabs.Despite the pandemic inconveniences, stall owners selling ornaments, roasted chestnuts and other Christmas-themed items in Frankfurt and other European cities are relieved to be open at all for their first Christmas market in two years, especially with new restrictions taking effect in Germany, Austria and other countries as Covid- infections hit record highs.Merchants who have opened are hoping for at least a fraction of the pre-pandemic Christmas sales that can make or break their businesses.Others are not so lucky. Many of the famous Christmas events have been cancelled in Germany and Austria. With the market closures goes the money that tourists would spend in restaurants, hotels and other businesses. vw,vw,px, px\"Lights illuminate a Christmas market in Berlin Jens Knauer, who crafts intricate, lighted Christmas-themed silhouettes that people can hang in windows, said his hope was simply that the Frankfurt market ldquostays open as long as possible.While Christmas is % of annual revenue for many retailers and restaurateurs, ldquowith me, itrsquos %, Mr Knauer said. ldquoIf I can stay open for three weeks, I can make it through the year.Sellers are on edge after other Christmas markets were abruptly shut down in Germanyrsquos Baia region, which includes Nuremberg, home of one of the biggest and best-known markets.Stunned exhibitors in Dresden had to pack up their goods when authorities in the eastern Saxony region suddenly imposed new restrictions amid soaring infections.Austriarsquos markets closed as a -day lockdown began on Monday, with many stall owners hoping they can reopenit is not extended. vw,vw,px, px\"The Christmas market in central Frankfurt Markets usually attract elbow-to-elbow crowds to row upon row of ornament and food sellers, foot traffic that spills over into revenue for surrounding hotels and restaurants. This year, the crowds at Frankfurtrsquos market were vastly thinned out, with the stalls spread out over a larger area.Heiner Roie, who runs a mulled wine hut in the shape of a wine barrel, said he is assuming he will see half the business he had in .A shutdown would cause ldquoimmense financial damage mdash it could lead to complete ruin since we havenrsquot made any income in two years, and at some point, the financial reserves are used up, he said.Butpeople have a little discipline and observe the health measures, ldquoI think wersquoll manage it, he added.Next door, Bettina Roiersquos guests are greeted with a sign asking them to show their vaccination certicates at her stand serving Swiss raclette, a popular melted cheese dish. vw,vw,px, px\"A man walks by a closed Christmas market in Vienna The market ldquohas a good concept because what we need is space, room, to keep some distance from each other, she said. ldquoIn contrast to a bricks-and-mortar restaurant, they have their building and their walls, but we can adjust ourselves to the circumstances.The extended Roie family is a fth-generation exhibitor business that also operates the merry-go-round on Frankfurtrsquos central Roemerberg square, where the market opened on Monday.Ms Roie said it was important to reopen ldquoso that we can bring the people even during the pandemic a little joy ndash thatrsquos what we do, we bring back joy.The latest spike in Covid- cases has unsettled prospects for Europersquos economic recovery, leading some economists to hedge their expectations for growth in the final months of the year.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, has cut his forecast for the last three months of the year in the  countries that use the euro from .% to .%. But he noted that the wave of infections is having less impact across the broad economy because vaccinations have reduced serious illnesses and many companies have learned to adjust. vw,vw,px, px\"Vender Nils Knauerbstnads at his booth at the Christmas market in Frankfurt Other European countries where the pandemic is not hitting as hard are ing to old ways.

Masks and social distancing will remain mandatory, organisers said.In Hungaryrsquos capital of Budapest, Christmas markets have been fenced off and visitors must show proof of vaccination to enter.Gyorgy Nagy, a producer and seller of handmade glazed crockery, said the restrictions initially stirred worries of fewer shoppers. But business has been good so far.ldquoI donrsquot think the fence is bad, he said. ldquoAt the beginning, we were scared of it, really scared, but I think itrsquos fine. I donrsquot think it will be a disadvantage.In Vienna, markets were packed last weekend as people sought some Christmas cheer before Austriarsquos lockdown. Merchants say closures last year and the new restrictions have had disastrous consequences.ldquoThe main sales for the whole year are made at the Christmas markets ndash this pause is a huge financial loss, said Laura Brechmann, who sold illuminated stars at the Spittelberg market before the lockdown began. ldquoWe hope things will reopen, but I personally donrsquot really expect it.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I think that I must still formally apologise to everyone, Chen wrote on her social media account.ldquoIrsquom a Chinese person, born and raised, I deeply love my motherland, she wrote. ldquoAnd I know, deeply, that as an artist, I have a responsibility to the mission to record and spread the Chinese peoplersquos culture.She joins numerous Chinese and foreign celebrities, brands and artists who have made public apologies following criticism of their work in state media. Some have been boycotted for refusing to apologise orthe apology is deemed insufficient.Her apology came more than a week after Dior was attacked over the photo at its exhibition in Shanghai, which pictured a model of Asian descent with tanned, freckled skin and darkened eyelids, holding a Dior purse.Critics deemed the photograph contrary to east Asian beauty standards of fair skin and said it perpetuated Western stereotypes of Asian faces, such as slanted eyes.At least one photo editor has praised her work in the past for creating an aesthetic that was aping neither Western magazines nor Japanese and South Korean ones. In , the Global Times described Chen as Chinarsquos answer to US photographer Annie Leibovitz, calling her a ldquoshining star with a unique perspective.Dior removed the photograph, adding that it was part of an art project and not an advertisement. In a statement on its Chinese social media account, Dior said it ldquorespects the feelings of Chinese people and ldquostrictly abides by Chinese laws and regulations.Other luxury brands have previously been embroiled in controversies in China. In , a Dolce  Gabbana advertisement sparked public outrage after the Asian model in the ad was instructed to eat spaghetti and pizza with a pair of chopsticks. The videos were later removed.The photograph taken down from the Shanghai exhibit was shot in a similar style to a series of covers Chen did for British fashion magazine i-D that featured  young Chinese women from dferent ethnic minorities. Many of the women did not fit what has become a common definition of beauty in China mdash some had small eyes and others had freckles.Ding Yining, a photo editor at Sixth Tone, praised Chenrsquos work in a  article for the state-backed English-language features website.ldquoFrom her works, it would seem that Chen prefers female models with narrow, single-lidded eyes and a sense of traditional east Asian elegance, Ding wrote.Chen told Sixth Tone that ldquoas a professional visual artist, I believe that I should help more people recognise the face of modern Chinese beauty with greater confidence.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

Credit: Victoria Jones PAGillian HallidayTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailLegislation introducing automatic le sentences for offenders who kill emergency services workers in the line of duty should be extended to Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster has said.The law, set to be introduced in England and Wales next year, follows a two-year campaign by Lissie Harper, whose police officer husband Andrew was killed while responding to a crime.The -year-old died from his injuries after he became caught in a strap attached to the back of a car and was dragged down a winding country road while investigating a late-night burglary on August , .Mrs Harper  previously said she was “outraged” over the sentences handed to the three teenagers responsible for her husband’s death.Known as ‘Harper’s law’, the legislation is expected to make it onto the statute books in an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, meaning it is likely to receive Royal Assent and become law early next year.Speaking to the Belfast , GB News presenter and former First Minister Arlene Foster said she was pleased to learn Home Secretary Priti Patel had backed Harper’s law.“I hope that the Justice Minister [Naomi Long] will follow her lead,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I would like to pay tribute to the campaign led by Lissie Harper after the killing of her husband whilst on duty as a police officer. I know that this is something emergency workers would welcome across Northern Ireland.”Mrs Foster also tweeted her support for a change in the law, tagging Ms Long in her post.The Department of Justice has been contacted for comment.Police officers, National Crime Agency officers, prison officers, custody officers, firefighters and paramedics are defined as emergency services workers.Mrs Harper said: “It’s been a long journey and a lot of hard work. I know Andrew would be proud to see Harper’s law reach this important milestone.”Henry Longwas sentenced to  years in prison and -year-olds Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers to  years for the manslaughter of Mr Harper, who was a Thames Valley Police traffic officer.Long, the leader of the group, admitted manslaughter, while passengers Cole and Bowers were convicted of manslaughter after a trial at the Old Bailey.All three were cleared of murder by the jury.The sentences prompted Mrs Harper to lobby the Government for better protection of emergency services workers.The Home Secretary said the new law was an important moment for frontline workers. Ms Patel added: “PC Andrew Harper’s killing was shocking. It is with thanks to the dedication of Lissie, and his family, that I am proud to be able to honour his le by introducing Harper’s law.”“Those who seek to harm our emergency service workers represent the very worst of humanity, and it is right that future killers be stripped of the freedom to walk our streets with a le sentence.”Separately, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, speaking to the BBC, said the law would not be retrospective, meaning PC Harper’s killers cannot have their sentences extended.The Court of Appeal previously rejected a bid by the Attorney General to increase their terms in prison.Mr Raab described PC Harper’s death as “harrowing” and paid tribute to “the amazing job” his widow has done in pressing for change.The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill is currently being considered by the House of Lords. Peers and MPs will have to agree to the proposed amendment before Harper’s law makes it onto the statute books.Related topicsArlene FosterDepartment of JusticeNaomi LongMore On Arlene FosterArlene Foster ‘delighted’ to be appointed director at peace-building organisation Co-operation IrelandArlene Foster ‘annoyed’ by advice to leave religion out of politicsIn court: Former DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly s to le as barrister PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionIs threat of SF First Minister enough to get DUP vote out My father held dying woman in his arms after blast: McAleeseMost ReadRathcoole Housing Executive workers down tools after death threatsSouth East Antrim UDA believed to be behind threat to contractors working in Rathcoole estateClaim NI can’t fund another lockdown doesn’t add up: public health expertArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudGlenlola Collegiate says ‘TikTok vandalism craze’ forced toilet closureTop VideosPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayNorthern Ireland Executive reinforces work-from-home guidanceLatest Northern IrelandClaire McNeillyOpinionBlack Friday: Streets or screens  The dilemma of big bargain ‘event’ and  deals to check outGovernment committed to rights safeguards in NI Protocol, Lord Frost saysTwo charged with attempted murder and kidnap after man found seriously injured in Antrim fieldJim GraceyOpinionGeorge Best is a Manchester United legend and my boyhood idol but he always made himself ordinary so he could make me feel importantToday#s headlines: Steer clear of Xmas parties, health staff urged...

Ms Hargey has said on several occasions she is committed to the reversal of social security service privatisation and ato in-house health assessments.SDLP communities spokesperson Mark H Durkan said he has been clear for years that in my view that Capita should not receive one penny more of taxpayer’s money for their administration of the Personal Independence Paymentsscheme.It is particularly galling to learn that they will now receive another £.m of public money over the next two years, he said.“We have repeatedly seen how the service offered by Capita not does provide value for money,” he said, adding that the y appeals process “leaves us with an even bigger bill to pay”.More signicantly this company leaves applicants traumatised due to the degrading and humiliating experiences they are subjected to and this should not have been allowed to continue,” he said.“This signicant amount of money could have been used to help deal with one of the many crises facing our people or gone towards reforming the PIP system or creating a way of evaluating those in receipt of welfare in a fair and humane way.Our Executive needs to cut its ties with Capita once and for all and stop rewarding these companies for their failure to adequately do their jobs. Minister Hargey also needs to provide clarity on her pledge to bring the assessment process in-house.DfC said: “To ensure value for money for the taxpayer, the Department for Communities has robust contract management arrangements in place.”Earlier this month, Capita apologised for any hurt caused to those going through the PIP process. Since , the firm has carried out around , assessments in Northern Ireland.Read MorePIP assessment firm Capita apologises for any hurt caused to applicantsCapita managing director Anthony King told MLAs on Stormont#s Communities Committee that the majority of PIP applicants have a high quality and empathetic experience, but he admitted this is not always the case.Often when things go wrong we can correct them very quickly, but in the small number of cases when things go wrong they can have very serious consequences for people and their families, he said.Obviously the more serious cases I am fully aware of and they can be deeply, deeply upsetting. I just want to take the opportunity today, in public, to say to anybody that has had a poor experience with Capita and been let down, that we are sorry. We do aspire to very high standards and we don#t always meet them we would like to apologise to those we have let down.Related topicsMark H.

I think that I must still formally apologise to everyone,” Chen wrote on her social media account.“I’m a Chinese person, born and raised, I deeply love my motherland,” she wrote. “And I know, deeply, that as an artist, I have a responsibility to the mission to record and spread the Chinese people’s culture.”She joins numerous Chinese and foreign celebrities, brands and artists who have made public apologies following criticism of their work in state media. Some have been boycotted for refusing to apologise orthe apology is deemed insufficient.Her apology came more than a week after Dior was attacked over the photo at its exhibition in Shanghai, which pictured a model of Asian descent with tanned, freckled skin and darkened eyelids, holding a Dior purse.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Critics deemed the photograph contrary to east Asian beauty standards of fair skin and said it perpetuated Western stereotypes of Asian faces, such as slanted eyes.It would seem that Chen prefers female models with narrow, single-lidded eyes and a sense of traditional east Asian eleganceDing Yining,At least one photo editor has praised her work in the past for creating an aesthetic that was aping neither Western magazines nor Japanese and South Korean ones. In , the Global Times described Chen as China’s answer to US photographer Annie Leibovitz, calling her a “shining star” with a unique perspective.Dior removed the photograph, adding that it was part of an art project and not an advertisement. In a statement on its Chinese social media account, Dior said it “respects the feelings of Chinese people” and “strictly abides by Chinese laws and regulations”.Other luxury brands have previously been embroiled in controversies in China. In , a Dolce  Gabbana advertisement sparked public outrage after the Asian model in the ad was instructed to eat spaghetti and pizza with a pair of chopsticks. The videos were later removed.The photograph taken down from the Shanghai exhibit was shot in a similar style to a series of covers Chen did for British fashion magazine i-D that featured  young Chinese women from dferent ethnic minorities. Many of the women did not fit what has become a common definition of beauty in China — some had small eyes and others had freckles.Ding Yining, a photo editor at Sixth Tone, praised Chen’s work in a  article for the state-backed English-language features website.“From her works, it would seem that Chen prefers female models with narrow, single-lidded eyes and a sense of traditional east Asian elegance,” Ding wrote.Chen told Sixth Tone that “as a professional visual artist, I believe that I should help more people recognise the face of modern Chinese beauty with greater confidence”.Most ReadRathcoole Housing Executive workers down tools after death threatsSouth East Antrim UDA believed to be behind threat to contractors working in Rathcoole estateArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudRevealed: Northern Ireland#s Top  Companies  – Full listClaim NI can’t fund another lockdown doesn’t add up: public health expertTop VideosPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayNorthern Ireland Executive reinforces work-from-home guidanceLatest WorldSouth Korean  to consider banning dog meat consumptionCautious opening for Europe’s Christmas markets as Covid cases riseBid to rescue trapped miners in Russia as  killed and dozens injured in fireAustralia sends troops and police to Solomon Islands amid unrestBlast near school in Somalia’s capital kills at least eightLatestFootball rumours: Barcelona keen on Cha duo Hakim Ziyech and Timo WernerGarth Brooks to perform five Croke Park gigsSouth Korean  to consider banning dog meat consumptionIndependent regulator for football idea endorsed in principle by the GovernmentMurdered sisters’ mother calls for Met Commissioner to ‘go’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eventhe K-pop band BTS and theSquid Game are ranked number one in the world, foreigners are still associating South Korea with dog meat and the Korean WarLee Won BokIt said authorities will gather information on dog farms, restaurants and other facilities while examining public opinion.The statement noted that “public awareness of their basic rights and animal rights issues are tangled in a complicated manner” when it comes to dog meat.Public opinion suggests “people have negative views both about eating dogs and legally banning it”, it added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The government says the initiative does not necessarily guarantee a ban, and the vague stance drew quick protests from dog farmers and animal rights activists.Farmers say the taskforce’s launch is a formality to shut down their farms and dog meat restaurants, while activists argue the government’s announcement lacks resolve to outlaw dog meat.Ju Yeongbong, general secretary of an association of dog farmers, accused the government of “trampling upon” the people’s right to eat what they want and farmers’ right to live.Lee Won Bok, head of the Korea Association for Animal Protection, called the government’s announcement “very disappointing” because it did not include any concrete plans on banning dog meat.About  million to . million dogs are killed each year for food in South Korea, a decrease from several million about - years ago.Thousands of farmers raise about  million to  million dogs for meat, according to the association of dog farmers.Ju said the farmers, mostly poor, elderly people, want the government to temporarily legalise dog meat consumption for about  years, with the expectation that demand will gradually taper off.Lee said animal rights organisations want a quicker end of the business.“South Korea is the only developed country where people eat dogs, an act that is undermining our international image,” Lee said. “Eventhe K-pop band BTS and theSquid Game are ranked number one in the world, foreigners are still associating South Korea with dog meat and the Korean War.”Lee accused many farmers of animal cruelty and other illegal activities when they raise and slaughter their dogs. Ju said activists “exaggerated” such information, and it only applies to a small number of farms.According to Lee, dogs are also consumed as food in North Korea, China and Vietnam.In September, President Moon Jae-in, a dog lover, asked during a meeting with his prime minister “ it’s time to carefully consider” a ban of dog meat, sparking a new debate.Dog meat is neither legal nor explicitly banned in South Korea.Most ReadRathcoole Housing Executive workers down tools after death threatsSouth East Antrim UDA believed to be behind threat to contractors working in Rathcoole estateArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudRevealed: Northern Ireland#s Top  Companies  – Full listClaim NI can’t fund another lockdown doesn’t add up: public health expertLatest WorldCautious opening for Europe’s Christmas markets as Covid cases riseBid to rescue trapped miners in Russia as  killed and dozens injured in fireAustralia sends troops and police to Solomon Islands amid unrestBlast near school in Somalia’s capital kills at least eightGermany passes milestone of , deaths from Covid-LatestIndependent regulator for football idea endorsed in principle by the GovernmentMurdered sisters’ mother calls for Met Commissioner to ‘go’Maximo Park, Example and Ella Henderson added to TRNSMT line-upRichard Osman shares update on Thursday Murder Club filmMikel Arteta reveals talks with Arsene Wenger about Arsenal ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Moneyneena woman, along with her husband Chris and young son Oisin, had just moved into their new home in Portstewart weeks before lockdown hit in March . The  year-old was on maternity leave at the time and toyed with the idea of releasing her own music. After uploading one of her songs onto her social media account, Kate was spurred on to keep writing following a positive reaction to her music. “I have been writing songs since I was  but I just never really got the chance to go down this road properly,” explained Kate, who is better known in Ballinascreen as Catherine Kennedy. “It really all happened during lockdown and maternity leave. The whole world shut down so I kind of found myself needing a creative outlet so I went down this path and started off with one single and it turned into the whole album.” Growing up in rural County Derry, Kate was inspired by the musical talent all around her. “Ive loved music as long as I remember. Draperstown is a great hub for music,” the former St Eoghans Moneyneena and St Patricks Maghera student said. “The likes of Maurice Regan and Glasgowbury brought music into the town. I actually live a mile from Glasgowbury so Ive always looked up to the scene. “Ive worked in Danny Ottersons music shop in Maghera and I worked in the Empire Music Hall as well when I was younger so I always had lots of music around me.” Even though she has been singing at wedding ceremonies and other events in local churches since the age of , with some encouragement from her older brother, Kate decided to explore songwriting. “My brother bought me a guitar for my seventeenth birthday and suggested I maybe try and write some of my own songs, so thats when it all started and it was always a nice distraction from doing A-levels,” she said. Fast forward  years and Kate has just released her second single Wrong Side of the Town from her upcoming debut album Fallen from Grace, due for release in the New Year. The new single, which features the unmistakable vocals of Cormac Neeson, lead singer of The Answer and successful solo artist. Despite the new song only being released five days earlier, Hotpress announced it as its track of the day on Wednesday. On Friday night past, Kate and Cormac performed the song live for the first time at an In the Round night of music with Sound of Belfast in the Empire Music Hall. The gig was one which Kate had been dreaming about for some time. “I used to glass collect thereand I used to look up at that stage and listen to all the amazing music so its a bit of a dream that this is happening,” said Kate. “Im a really big fan of Cormacs. He was one of the acts that stood out to me when I worked in the Empire. He was playing in his band The Answer and I had to rub my eyes to check it wasnt Robert Plant. He has just one of the best voices in the industry, I think. “I worked with Mojo Furys frontman, Michael Mormecha for the album and I told him that I would love Cormac to sing on this song and he just asked him and sent him the song and he said he was up for it. “Its really funny, a year before this all came about, I was at a gig and Cormac was playing at it. I said to my husband Chris how cool would he be on Wrong Side of the Town  I had the song written and had this all in my head and its happened. Its pretty cool how it worked out. “This is one of my favourite songs to date. I love the blues rock sound we have achieved using inspirations from some Deep South Americana  Blues music and some soundtracks I love, such as True Detective and Sons of Anarchy. “Wrong Side of the Town explores the often fine and blurry line that can exist between having a really great time, and that of self destruction. The song aims to look at this from ious angles.” Kate, who recently became a mum for the second time to baby Tomas, now three months-old, admits that her music doesnt fit neatly into any category and she is heavily influenced by a iety of artists. “I love a big range of music but Dolores ORiordan of The Cranberries is one of my icons. I also like Amy Winehouse. Theres also a big American theme running through my music,” she continued. “I call it alternative country rock – the closest thing to it would be Sheryl Crowe - it doesnt fit neatly into any category.” So, with her newest single receiving rave reviews and an album launch just around the corner, Kate says she is looking forward to more live performances and is even thinking about her next project. “Ive been delighted with the reaction to the singles – Wrong Side of the Town and Street Lamps - I got really great support for it and Im just looking forward to getting the whole album out and hopefully there will be a nice celebration for it. “Im also looking forward to being able to perform to a live audience. Ive played live over Zoom through a group called Mothers in Music with the Oh Yeah Music Centre who have been really supportive. “Charlene Hegarty from Maghera is the talent development officer with the Oh Yeah Music Centre and she has been helping us Mothers in Music as a group. Its been lovely to have her support. “Theres just something very special about playing live in front of real people. Its so dferent compared to performing over Zoom – its like night and day. Zoom was brilliant for the times that were in it but live music is where its at. Theres just something about the atmosphere and having people in the room at the same time. “Thinking about the future, I love Irish traditional music as well so Im kind of thinking along those lines for the next project maybe. Its something a bit dferent.” Kate says she enjoys making the trip home to Moneyneena once or twice a month and says she is delighted with the support she has received from locals. “I love Moneyneena. Its a gorgeous part of the world. I am delighted to still be living in County Derry, so Im not too far away. “Ive been really taken aback by how supportive people have been. Ive had really nice support and I couldnt be more grateful for their support and encouragement but I dont take anything for granted. Im just going to enjoy it,” she added.

Creator and writer of Derry Girls, Lisa McGee, saw the social media campaign and said yes to his request. Eamonn was born with cerebral palsy which affects his movement and speech. The -year-oldgraduated from his drama course in summer this year and wants to follow his dreams to be a writer and actor. Speaking to the BBC, Eamonn said: I want to inspire people to chase their dreams to write and act. I think its great to show that some things are possible evenyou have a disability. I had a massive smile on my face. His friend Sean added: For Eamonn to have a degree and have cerebral palsy is a massive deal for him and his family. Hes a massive Derry Girls fan so we decided to push hard to get on it. Eamonn messaged the cast directly and I tried whatever influence I have on Twitter to contact Lisa McGee too.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry film event to honour Bahai who sold his Titanic tickets overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry film event to honour Bahai who sold his Titanic tickets overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

He said: “Following a request to the Council, I worked with the charity Medical Aid for Palestine and Derry Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaignand the Guildhall will be lit-up in the colours of the Palestinian flag on November  – the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people. “Derry and Strabane Council supports the Palestinian struggle for liberation and backs boycott, estment and sanction of the Israeli Apartheid regime. “We encourage people to mark and join actions across Ireland on Monday November  to send a message of solidarity to the people of Palestine and one to the Irish, British, EU and US governments demanding an end of their complicity with Israeli Apartheids carnival of reaction. “We call on all political parties across the island, including those professing support for Palestine, to end engagement with organisations seeking to normalise Israeli apartheid. “Human rights and Israeli apartheid, just as it was in South Africa, is a contradiction in terms. “A state with equal rights for Arabs, Jews, Christians and all who live in historic Palestine is possible, but only through the removal of US imperialism and its backing of Israeli militarism. “November  is a day to celebrate all that is Palestinian, including the struggle over many decades for justice and freedom.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Ministers stated that working from home can help reduce the rise of Covid- but stopped short of ordering all employers to facilitate home working. However, Mr Clancy said that this weeks statement from the Executive has heightened concerns and stated that the number of “mixed messages” from Stormont has not provided sufficient clarity for businesses and employers which has made them worry about “being left in the lurch for a second Christmas”. He said: “The latest Executive decisions have done little except raise anxieties among business owners and leaders. “Even though it has been reinforced and reiterated by ministers, the ‘work from homepossible’ guidance has not changed since the start of the pandemic and, as such, this announcement by the Executive is merely tinkering around the edges. However, it has heightened concerns for businesses. “Mixed messaging from separate Executive ministers as well this week is harming business confidence. “We have the Health Minister saying one day that hospitality businesses may be required to close over Christmas, while the next day the First Minister says we are not ‘in a space where we can be looking at closure of businesses’. “These statements are wholly contradictory and do nothing to provide clarity or certainty for businesses at one of the busiest and most important times of the year. “Increased talk by ministers of restrictions or sweeping mitigations are deeply concerning for businesses. However, there has been no talk of financial supports or safeguards in such a scenario. “All this does is raise anxiety levels for small business owners and makes them worry that they’ll be left in the lurch for a second Christmas running. “It’s crucial that the Executive commits to clear messaging over the coming weeks and works together to suppress Covid cases. “We would also encourage shoppers and customers to continue to wear their face masks when out and about this Christmas and take sensible decisions which will keep everyone safe.” Chief Executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts warned of a knock-on effect that could hurt the retail sector and stated that the importance of the Executive implementing a support package to traders was “a matter of urgency”. He said: “Whilst we recognise the importance of controlling Covid- community transmission and the part everyone must play, the Executive’s decision to strengthen work-from-home guidance will have a signicant knock-on effect on our local high streets and independent retailers who rely on footfall from office workers.  Chief Executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts: If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for our high street retailers will be damaging  “The Christmas period is traditionally one of the busiest periods for many businesses, especially smaller retailers who are the leblood of our towns and cities. “After the severe impact of the pandemic, these businesses need all the support they can get. If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for our high street retailers will be damaging. “Independent traders have been hard-hit in the last  months and are only starting to get back on their feet. It is imperative that the Executive works alongside the retail sector and implements a support package to local traders affected by this decision as a matter of urgency.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry film event to honour Bahai who sold his Titanic tickets overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Ministers stated that working from home can help reduce the rise of Covid- but stopped short of ordering all employers to facilitate home working. However, Mr Clancy said that this weeks statement from the Executive has heightened concerns and stated that the number of “mixed messages” from Stormont has not provided sufficient clarity for businesses and employers which has made them worry about “being left in the lurch for a second Christmas”. He said: “The latest Executive decisions have done little except raise anxieties among business owners and leaders. “Even though it has been reinforced and reiterated by ministers, the ‘work from homepossible’ guidance has not changed since the start of the pandemic and, as such, this announcement by the Executive is merely tinkering around the edges. However, it has heightened concerns for businesses. “Mixed messaging from separate Executive ministers as well this week is harming business confidence. “We have the Health Minister saying one day that hospitality businesses may be required to close over Christmas, while the next day the First Minister says we are not ‘in a space where we can be looking at closure of businesses’. “These statements are wholly contradictory and do nothing to provide clarity or certainty for businesses at one of the busiest and most important times of the year. “Increased talk by ministers of restrictions or sweeping mitigations are deeply concerning for businesses. However, there has been no talk of financial supports or safeguards in such a scenario. “All this does is raise anxiety levels for small business owners and makes them worry that they’ll be left in the lurch for a second Christmas running. “It’s crucial that the Executive commits to clear messaging over the coming weeks and works together to suppress Covid cases. “We would also encourage shoppers and customers to continue to wear their face masks when out and about this Christmas and take sensible decisions which will keep everyone safe.” Chief Executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts warned of a knock-on effect that could hurt the retail sector and stated that the importance of the Executive implementing a support package to traders was “a matter of urgency”. He said: “Whilst we recognise the importance of controlling Covid- community transmission and the part everyone must play, the Executive’s decision to strengthen work-from-home guidance will have a signicant knock-on effect on our local high streets and independent retailers who rely on footfall from office workers.  Chief Executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts: If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for our high street retailers will be damaging  “The Christmas period is traditionally one of the busiest periods for many businesses, especially smaller retailers who are the leblood of our towns and cities. “After the severe impact of the pandemic, these businesses need all the support they can get. If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for our high street retailers will be damaging. “Independent traders have been hard-hit in the last  months and are only starting to get back on their feet. It is imperative that the Executive works alongside the retail sector and implements a support package to local traders affected by this decision as a matter of urgency.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry film event to honour Bahai who sold his Titanic tickets overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

However, Mr Durkan – who is also the SDLPs Justice Spokesperson – accused Ms Hargey of resting “on her laurels” and that her “lackadaisical approach” would leave those in desperate need of support in a vulnerable position. He said: “There is no denying that the winter period will present a huge challenge for already struggling households. “The cruel cuts to Universal Credit, spiralling energy costs and the economic fallout of the pandemic have created a perfect storm. “Yet despite persistent calls for an emergency support package or a Household Support Fund similar to that announced in England in September for vulnerable families, the Minister rests on her laurels. “Minister Hargey cannot laud the North’s ‘unique’ Discretionary Support Scheme as a cure-all amidst the unfolding cost of living crisis. “A scheme, which she seems to have forgotten failed serve its intended purpose of protecting people here, evidenced in theof pound million of unspent funds. “Again, Minister Hargey’s lackadaisical approach to protecting the vulnerable and in this case, outright dereliction of duty will leave people without adequate support at a time when they need it most.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.    Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.    The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.    Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Tommy Gallagher.Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Steelstown manager Hugh McGrath has urged GAA supporters around the county to back his side in their Ulster Intermediate Championship quarter-final. googletag.cmd.push After beating Donegal’s Cloughaneely in a dramatic preliminary round game on Saturday, the Oacuteg’s will now face Monaghan champions Donaghmoyne in Celtic Park in a fortnight’s time. “Donaghmoyne are a good outfit. I’ve watched them twice now and they’ll not pass up as many chances as Cloughaneely,” said the Down man. “It’s great to have a home tie in Celtic Park and it would be greatwe could get as many people out to support us as possible – I think this group deserve that. “It’s been a long road since last year and losing the final so the more days that you can get with big support, the better. “We have never had that many supporters out and around our own county, it’s been very much our own group within the city, and it shows. “The group is tight, it will always be tight, and we stick together. The more we see of the city clubs sticking together, the better. “For years it was all about parish rivalries in the city but there’s no need for it. “We’re all competing on the same  and the sooner we help each other and get everybody up to the intermediate level to start off with, the better for football in the city.” McGrath’s men dominated the game, but in their first run at Ulster intermediate football the nerves were certainly there, and but for the crossbar in the dying seconds the Ballyarnett men could have exited the competition. Neil Forester tracks his man on Saturday afternoon. Pic by Tommy Gallagher. For the manager, the character on display was no surprise. “It wouldn’t be a Steelstown gamewe didn’t make it exciting for everyone in the stands. It’s a dficult one,” he said. “We were in uncharted territory here and we just had to see how the guys reacted. The positive thing that we got out of it was the result obviously. “The performance wasn’t what we wanted it to be, but I think when we went behind in the first half we showed our character again. “I don’t think that should ever be questioned with this group. They showed what they’re capable of doing. “Even when they go behind, they don’t panic – they just go through their process and make sure they get out on the right end of the scoreline. “We bossed the entire first half bar maybe three or four minutes of it, but Cloughaneely are not champions of Donegal and playing Division One football all year for no reason. A certain Derry manager warned me during the week that Cloughaneely were a very good outfit and they’d be very hard to beat. He’s never usually too far off the mark and he was exactly right. “There’s always going to be a sting from a team like that and they showed what they’re capable of. I think we showed what we’re capable of too. We’re capable of digging deep, we showed what our bench can do as well. “We’ve as many good players coming into the team as have started it and for us that’s a positive. “We need to build on it and take the next step. For us it was about getting a win in Ulster, next step is two wins in Ulster and we’ll see where we go from there.”  PREVIEW: Ulster a chance to throw off the shackles for Steelstown  The intermediate champions take on Cloughaneely in Letterkenny on Saturday.

Pic by Catherine Comer.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A disappointed Barney McGrellis broke from the post-match team huddle as the Creggan supporters surrounded their winning team behind them. googletag.cmd.push Having just been on the end of an agonising one-point defeat at the hands of the Antrim champions, there was an obvious feeling of dejection. “Im absolutely gutted,” McGrellis told the County Derry Post. “We did everything in our power today to come out on the right side, and the things we needed to fall our way didnt fall our way. “Fair play to Creggan, they are value for it, but there would be a few decisions Id feel aggrieved at. “Roseannas sending off was very soft, and possibly the Creggan red card as well, but the girls rallied. “The one thing we always ask them is to have no excuses.” Tasked with picking up the talented Eavanne Martin, McGrellis reserved praise for the midfielder Orla McEvoy, who took on the role with relish. “Orla is an unbelievable athlete and put everything into that today,” said McGrellis. Orla McEvoy was outstanding for her side on Saturday. Pic by Catherine Comer. “Every time weve asked her to pick up somebody, the other person has tended to be an afterthought. “We got our match ups right, we set up pretty well, but we lost a bit of shape in the second half and couldnt get enough ball into the forwards to do damage.” While most teams have to wait the guts of a year, Rossa are in the unique position of being able to put things right immediately. They travel to Mullaghbawn this weekend as the  Bridie McMenamin Shield competition begins, and manager McGrellis says the team has a chance to push on and improve. “Theres a lot hurt and pain there today, and normally when that happens you have a year to wait to put it right, whereas we have the opportunity to go out next week,” he said. “Were missing a few players next weekend but well go down to Mullaghbawn and do the same thing as we always do look for no excuses and try and put on our best performance “To get a chance to bounce back so quickly is nice. They are an unreal group, theyre so close and there are a lot of family connections. “The sky is the limit,they knuckle down they can go places. Success might look dferent now when they go up to intermediate, but there is no reason they cant continue to be successful.”  Heartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final  The Magherafelt side lost out by the slimmest of margins.    Late scores see Loup edge tense U semi final  St Patricks will meet  champions Dungiven in the decider.    PREVIEW: Noisy neighbours to fight for Ulster junior camogie crown  Creggan and Magherafelt know each other well.

Friday’s results in the other group threw up St Killians Garron Tower as the team they would facethey beat Knock. In the end it was a comfortable enough morning in Lavey for Maghera against Our Lady’s  St Patrick’s Knock with an early goal from Oisin McNicholl paving the way for a - to - win. McNicholl had opened the scoring within the first  seconds with a breakaway point and four minutes later Knock’s best player and free-taker Eoin Pucci fired over an equaliser. Then in the sixth minute Eoin Scullion played McNicholl in for the goal. The sliotar seemed to die on the heavy pitch and McNicholl scooped it home from close range. Maghera never looked back with Knock very dependent on Eoin Pucci frees to keep them in contact. The Maghera half-back line of Dara McGonigle, James Friel and Fionn McEldowney was in control throughout with Eoin Scullion dropping back from midfield as an extra shield. Scullion and Shea McKenna were on top at midfield and Peter McCullagh was always available to run at the knock defence. It was - to - at the water break with four of the Maghera points coming from McCullaghand that gap stretched to - to - by the interval with Jarlath McCollum eventually getting Knock’s first score from open play in the thminute. McCullagh hit two more frees and Callum O’Kane took a fine point when he took his player on in the thminute. Eoin Scullion and free-taker Pucci exchanged points on the re-start, and then Cormac Mullan’s goal in the thminute made sure that there would be no way back for Knock. The spade-work was done by McCullagh but Mullan still had plenty to do before he crashed the sliotar past Tiarnaacuten Davis. Davis brought off a good save from Shea O’Neill at the start of the last quarter that only produced three points, all of them top class scores. Knock could claim the score of the game when Shea Pucci fired over left-handed from right on the side-line. But that point was cancelled almost immediately by a fine long-range effort from Callum O’Kane and Fionn McEldowney fired over another fine point late in the game. Both semi-finalsare due to take place next week with the final scheduled for the weekend of December  .

The winner will receive a prize package including specially commissioned Volunteer of the Year merchandise, a Translink Enterprise Plus travel voucher for two people to Dublin and a set of jerseys for their club youth team. Gaelic Football, Hurling, Camogie, Rounders and Handball clubs across Ulster are encouraged to nominate young people aged - years old whose actions best demonstrate the volunteering ethos and community spirit of the Association during the year. Encouraging the GAA community to seize the opportunity to celebrate its young people, Stephen Montgomery from Translink, said: “Translink recognises the importance of promoting an active and healthy lestyle and values the impact a strong community spirit can make in local areas – something the Young Volunteer of the Year Award is all about. “It is great to see this awardfor another year and I’d like to thank Ulster GAA for working in partnership with Translink to deliver this fantastic celebration of volunteering. I’d also like to pay tribute to all the clubs and coaches who train, motivate and inspire their players to be the best they can be, as well as the young people who volunteer hours of their time for their local clubs. Good Luck!” Ulster GAA President Oliver Galligan said: “Volunteerism is at the heart of everything that happens in the GAA across the province and we are delighted that our initiative with Translink recognises the positive impact that our youth members have with their clubs and communities through a wide range of volunteer activities, including coaching, well-being schemes, fundraising and committee membership. “At the end of the GAA season, I would encourage all of our clubs to celebrate their own young leaders by entering a nomination for this award”.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge. Based on the results that day, the Masters Association drew up teams of six plus one reserve for each age group -, -, - and so on.Jonny was duly notied that he was picked to run as reserve in the - category and so he turned up at Queens Playing Fields last Saturday, slightly concerned as to how he would cope given the standard of the runners.He had no need to worry as he paced it well and did himself and the club proud.He was rd in the end and completed the five lap muddy circuit in  odd minutes. He expressed his awe of the standard at the front of the race and felt that it was great to have the experience of being part of such a competitive event.This weekend sees the cross country season continue with a large EDAC squad heading to Comber for the Comber Cup and some juniors travelling to Santry in Dublin for the All-Ireland Even Age Group Championships as part of the Co Down team.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know. I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face. She just froze.Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it, but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB news - but said more must be done to tackle the hurtful abuse on social media particularly against women.Mrs Foster was welcomed by Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, who said her personal story was incredibly interesting.He remarked: ldquoArlene Foster was extremely gracious and gave very generously of her time and people in the audience responded to her warmth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  November 21%2C 2001  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash An appeal has been made by members of a Newcastle pressure group for more community support to help in the fight to keep the Rock Pool open.The Friends of the Rock Pool group, which formed in January following the news that Down Council was considering closing the  year-old facility because of rising overheads and ain visitor numbers, held a special meeting on Wednesday night.The event was convened because just a handful of supporters attended the action grouprsquos last meeting in September.As a result of this low turnout, letters were sent to members telling them the previous meeting had been ldquovery poorly attended and the survival of the Rock Pool ldquowould not succeed on the efforts of three or four people.Speaking during the meeting, the grouprsquos chairwoman, Mary Hull, said the Friends of the Rock Pool would only continue to existmembers ldquoworked together as a group.ldquoThe core we had at the start has sadly fallen away and we need to regroup.

a progress report on the continuing work to regenerate a number of key buildings.The work forms part of an ambitious townscape heritage initiative which is currently underway in the market town along with other similar schemes in Downpatrick and Killough.The White Horse Inn, one of the oldest buildings in Saintfield and which itself has featured heavily in the heritage initiative, was the setting for the progress report delivered by Mrs Harriet Devlin.The Saintfield Town Committee official, who is heavily involved in the project, paid tribute to the ious business and home owners who played key

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Launch of blog to help needs of BAME residents in district  ","story":"A NEW blog site for Newry, Mourne and Down Intercultural Forum has been launched.The forum was established in  to develop a strategic approach to identy the needs of black, Asian and minority ethnicgroups living in the district.Launched last week at South Eastern Regional Collegersquos Newcastle campus, the blog site provides a  in which each of the partners working together can share vital information to create an inclusive community that embraces ersity.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said: ldquoOn behalf of the council and the PEACE IV team, I would like to thank Forsythe Consulting for the effective facilitation of the Forum and RANE Digital Marketing and Kernaghan Consulting for their work on the creation of this online blog.ldquoIt will act as a vital tool in educating, advising, and engaging with the community on the important work undertaken by the forum and the interagency partners involved.The forum seeks to maximise resources and opportunities to promote equity, ersity and interdependence so that citizens with a BAME background feel recognised, fairly treated, safe and valued in the community.It is made up of representatives from the,Southern Health and Social Care Trust, The Ethnic Minority Centre, Police Service of Northern Ireland, Advice Newry Mourne and Down, Wah Help Chinese Community Association, South Eastern Regional College, Southern Regional College, Newry Chamber of Commerce, County Down Rural Community Network and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.The project is supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme which is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .

Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Had the result stayed that way, the Republic under Jack Charlton might not have qualied for the  World Cup.The pleasure of the Green and White Army at going ahead in such a crucial match, when Northern Ireland could not itself by that stage qualy for the tournament, was interpreted as deep sectarianism. But people who reached that conclusion were mis-interpreting the NI fans, who were celebrating for reasons such as the long rivalry between the two teams and the fact that NI were underdogs. Perhaps also there was a sense that the Republic’s much-discussed progress towards the finals was somewhat smug.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There had indeed that night been some disgraceful sectarian conduct, leading to a number of NI fans being excluded from the grounds. But not only was there no suggestion from any journalist or credible sources who attended the match that there was widespread sectarian chanting, it is still possible to watch the game online and see that there is no sign of such behaviour.Yet there has been a shocking but unfounded claim that fans chanted ‘Trick or Treat’, as a taunting reference to the Greysteel loyalist murder of Catholic civilians weeks earlier.Today our reporter Mark Rainey, who was at the game, helps to set the record straight — that the crowd at the game had been well behaved, which at the time was a relief to everyone given the then communal tensions due to Greysteel and the preceding republican massacre at Shankill.Why in so many contexts does this happen in Northern Ireland  Constant accusations of loyalist or unionist sectarianism, often involving exaggerations and distortions, and typically pushed by people who are convinced of their own rectitude.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo: Arthur Allison PacemakerPeter Hain said the current shadow secretary of state’s position is “absolutely correct” and “loyal to the Good Friday Agreement”.Lord Hain, who served as NI secretary in Tony Blair’s government between  and , made his comments after Ms Haigh was criticised for having a “puzzling” and “contradictory” stance on the UK.On Tuesday, Ms Haigh told GB News that the United Kingdom had already said it had no selfish interest in the Province.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is not my job be a persuader for the Union.”Ms Haigh’s claims prompted ex-Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken to say: “The approach of the shadow secretary of state is very puzzling and her comments are contradictory to say the least.”Mr Aiken added: “Certainly, nobody considers it even remotely likely that the Republic of Ireland’s government would adopt a stance of neutrality. If the shadow secretary of state has her way, we would be facing a future referendum campaign whereby the Dublin government would be campaigning actively for unity, but a Labour administration in London... not caring either waythe UK as we know it, continues to exist or not”.However, Mr Hain said that by adopting the position of an “honest broker” he was able to forge close links with both Dr Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness leading up to the  settlement between the DUP and Sinn Fein.“Partly the reason that they were able to come together was that I was able to build trust with both of them. Now, you can only do thatyou are trusted by all sides,” he told BBC Talkback on Wednesday.Commenting on the prospect of a border poll, he said: “That is determined by the Good Friday Agreement. I don’t advocate a united Ireland and more than I advocate a dferent option for Northern Ireland”.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Elsewhere, security officers check vaccination certicates before letting customers head towards the steaming sausages and kebabs.Despite the pandemic inconveniences, stall owners selling ornaments, roasted chestnuts and other Christmas-themed items in Frankfurt and other European cities are relieved to be open at all for their first Christmas market in two years, especially with new restrictions taking effect in Germany, Austria and other countries as Covid- infections hit record highs.Merchants who have opened are hoping for at least a fraction of the pre-pandemic Christmas sales that can make or break their businesses.Others are not so lucky.

Masks and social distancing will remain mandatory, organisers said.In Hungaryrsquos capital of Budapest, Christmas markets have been fenced off and visitors must show proof of vaccination to enter.Gyorgy Nagy, a producer and seller of handmade glazed crockery, said the restrictions initially stirred worries of fewer shoppers.

I think that I must still formally apologise to everyone, Chen wrote on her social media account.ldquoIrsquom a Chinese person, born and raised, I deeply love my motherland, she wrote. ldquoAnd I know, deeply, that as an artist, I have a responsibility to the mission to record and spread the Chinese peoplersquos culture.She joins numerous Chinese and foreign celebrities, brands and artists who have made public apologies following criticism of their work in state media. Some have been boycotted for refusing to apologise orthe apology is deemed insufficient.Her apology came more than a week after Dior was attacked over the photo at its exhibition in Shanghai, which pictured a model of Asian descent with tanned, freckled skin and darkened eyelids, holding a Dior purse.Critics deemed the photograph contrary to east Asian beauty standards of fair skin and said it perpetuated Western stereotypes of Asian faces, such as slanted eyes.At least one photo editor has praised her work in the past for creating an aesthetic that was aping neither Western magazines nor Japanese and South Korean ones. In , the Global Times described Chen as Chinarsquos answer to US photographer Annie Leibovitz, calling her a ldquoshining star with a unique perspective..removeDior removed the photograph, adding that it was part of an art project and not an advertisement. In a statement on its Chinese social media account, Dior said it ldquorespects the feelings of Chinese people and ldquostrictly abides by Chinese laws and regulations.Other luxury brands have previously been embroiled in controversies in China. In , a Dolce  Gabbana advertisement sparked public outrage after the Asian model in the ad was instructed to eat spaghetti and pizza with a pair of chopsticks. The videos were later removed.The photograph taken down from the Shanghai exhibit was shot in a similar style to a series of covers Chen did for British fashion magazine i-D that featured  young Chinese women from dferent ethnic minorities. Many of the women did not fit what has become a common definition of beauty in China mdash some had small eyes and others had freckles.Ding Yining, a photo editor at Sixth Tone, praised Chenrsquos work in a  article for the state-backed English-language features website.ldquoFrom her works, it would seem that Chen prefers female models with narrow, single-lidded eyes and a sense of traditional east Asian elegance, Ding wrote.Chen told Sixth Tone that ldquoas a professional visual artist, I believe that I should help more people recognise the face of modern Chinese beauty with greater confidence..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Chinese photographer apologises over  uinsulting u images as Dior pulls picture article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
