Onset for the disease is usually 65 and older.There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease currently, though various medication and management strategies may help to alleviate symptoms on a temporary basis. Not much is known about the cause of the disease, though about 70 percent of the risk is believed to be genetic. Other risk factors are believed to be hypertension, depression and head injuries.Named after German pathologist and psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the disease currently impacts approximately 29.8 million people worldwide as of 2015.Alexander Povetkin net worth: Anthony Joshua\u0027s opponent\u0027s wealth revealed ahead of fightThe Best FIFA Football Awards 2018: Everything you need to knowUnder Armour Project Rock: The Rock releases new Under Armour sneakers and clothingEuroMillions results: National Lottery numbers for Friday, 21 SeptemberBachelor 2019: Colton\u0027s cast, start date, spoilers and moreLil Wayne Tha Carter V: Weezy fans vent on Twitter after long-awaited album isn\u0027t releasedWhen is the X Factor 2018 final and how to get tickets revealedX Factor 2018 spoilers: Judges\u0027 categories, guest stars, final date and more revealed Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood star is celebrated with a Google DoodleWho is Khabib Nurmagomedov?

To me, if I\u0027m getting my picture taken, it\u0027s modeling, even if it\u0027s for my own brand.\u0027She joked and added she\u0027ll quit \u0027when people stop asking. Maybe that\u0027s the answer.\u0027Crawford continued: \u0027When I started modeling, I thought - because I dropped out of college - I thought I\u0027d model until I am 25 and then maybe I\u0027ll go back to school, or I\u0027ll figure out what I\u0027m really going to do with my life.\u0027I had no idea that I would be standing here today still doing modeling and getting my picture taken.\u0027Kaia Gerber exhibits her model prowess in scribble print...Cindy Crawford cuts a chic figure in polka dot blouse and...Share this article    The supermodel (pictured in 1991), who was signed by Elite Models aged 17, said retirement was not on her mind, after walking away from the industry in 2000 and returning in 2011          Crawford (pictured in 1990) continued: \u0027When I started modeling, I thought - because I dropped out of college - I thought I\u0027d model until I am 25 and then maybe I\u0027ll go back to school, or I\u0027ll figure out what I\u0027m really going to do with my life\u0027Crawford admits the industry has changed in some ways since her heyday, explaining: \u0027The act of modeling has not changed at all. \u0027When you\u0027re a model, you stand in front of a camera, or walk down a runway and that\u0027s still the same. \u0027But now there\u0027s this extra-added layer of keeping up your social media and I think there\u0027s a lot more pressure in a way, because it\u0027s daily. \u0027I always say it\u0027s like a little hungry animal that needs to be fed everyday and it\u0027s never full. It\u0027s always like, \u0027\u0027More, more, more.\u0027\u0027\u0027And so I think that sometimes for young models, and especially when you\u0027re young, you\u0027re not always so, \u0027\u0027Hmm, is this a good thing to post, or a bad thing to post?\u0027\u0027\u0027You know you\u0027re young you make mistakes. So I think it puts some extra pressure on them.\u0027 Crawford also revealed that the secret to her ageless skin is a super antioxidant extracted from a rare melon that\u0027s only ripe only two weeks out of the year in the south of France.          Crawford also revealed the secret to her ageless skin - a super antioxidant extracted from a rare melon that\u0027s only ripe only two weeks out of the year in the south of France          She said she became concerned about her skin when she was only 28, flying out to Paris to visit a special skin rejuvenation expert to obtain a dose of the ingredient She said she became concerned about her skin when she was only 28, flying out to Paris to visit a special skin rejuvenation expert to obtain a dose of the ingredient.Crawford said the melon antioxidant was essential to her Meaningful Beauty products after meeting French Dr. Jean-Louis Sebagh at the height of her career, which was \u0027like love at first sight\u0027.\u0027I would always see him whenever I was in Paris,\u0027 Crawford said. \u0027I think he\u0027s known as the melon doctor. Everyone\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027What\u0027s with those melons? Where can I get the melons?\u0027\u0027 \u0027But you can only get them in the south of France and you can only get them fresh for like two weeks out of the summer.\u0027 Crawford spoke of her pride at having not rested on her laurels despite earning millions as the face of huge advertising campaigns in the 1980s and 1990s.She described it as using the \u0027momentum from modeling and turning it into a business.\u0027The mother-of-two said: \u0027I think what\u0027s exciting to me is not only when women come up to me and tell me they love Meaningful Beauty, but when young models come up to me and say, \u0027\u0027I want a career like yours. I want to have a long career. I want to own my own brand. I want to be in charge of my own image.\u0027\u0027 \u0027So in that way, I guess it\u0027s very rewarding being a role model, especially as now my own daughter is starting her own path into the fashion industry and I\u0027m around a lot more young models and even her friends will come to me for advice, so it\u0027s sweet.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"If Diana worn seatbelt Harrys wedding says 9 11 pathologist","story":"    Princess Diana (pictured) would have walked away with a \u0027black eye\u0027 if she had worn a seatbelt, according to pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd, who worked on her inquestSince that day he has performed more than 23,000 post-mortem examinations, including on victims of murder, suicide, explosions, accidents, mass disasters and terror attacks.He was the pathologist in charge when 35 were killed in the Clapham rail disaster in 1988. He examined the drowned bodies after the Marchioness tragedy in which a Thames pleasure boat sank with the loss of 51 lives in 1989. He was in Bali after the terrorist bomb attacks in 2002 and carried out post-mortems after the London 77 bombings in 2005, having sifted through human remains in the aftermath of 911 in New York four years earlier.After Princess Diana died in August 1997, he re-examined her body for the official inquiry into her death. He also carried out the post-mortems on young mother Rachel Nickell, murdered on Wimbledon Common in 1992, and Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager stabbed to death in a racial attack a year later.Every day he confronts death and sometimes disaster. Yet of all these tragedies and others, familial, national and global, it was Hungerford that prompted the first symptoms in an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder so profound, it led him to thoughts of suicide.          \u0027Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces,\u0027 said pathologist Dr Richard ShepherdThree years ago — almost 30 years after he had driven through the town in the ghostly half-light that summer evening after the killings — Richard was piloting the small plane he flies for pleasure when he noticed that, quite by chance, he was flying over the town.\u0027I looked down and there was Hungerford,\u0027 Richard, now 65, recalls. \u0027It was as random as that. I started to feel something like nausea, but more ominous.\u0027It came from deep inside me, forcing its way through my body with such power I felt breathless. I felt unhappiness and dread a sense that something terrible was about to happen — even an urge to make it happen — and a ludicrous thought crossed my mind. What if I got out of the plane? I struggled to stay in my seat, to keep breathing, to control the plane.\u0027Then I flew over Savernake Forest and the feeling passed. But it had never happened before in the whole of my career and it was the first intimation that things were building up, an early sign of PTSD.\u0027During 30 years I\u0027d seen bodies in death, decomposition and after illness, crimes and disasters, yet it was the first time I thought my job could have emotional repercussions.\u0027          He also worked on Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in a racial attack in 1993\u0027I considered various possibilities. I was going to take my seatbelt off and crash the car at speed. I thought it wouldn\u0027t involve anyone else.\u0027But the nurse said: \u0027What about the people who have to sort it all out? And how will your family feel?\u0027Fortunately, the suicidal thoughts soon passed and within a year Richard had stopped taking medication.But the respite from work gave him time to write a memoir, Unnatural Causes, which is just published.\u0027It wasn\u0027t an exercise in self-analysis but it proved therapeutic to be a bit more introspective about my work,\u0027 he says today. \u0027The writing became a sort of therapy.\u0027And I think it\u0027s important people understand what we pathologists do, that we\u0027re not Dracula figures, that our job is a traumatic one and that society needs someone to do it.\u0027We need to know how and why our citizens die, that there isn\u0027t another Harold Shipman around.\u0027 (Richard was also involved in the case of the Greater Manchester GP who killed more than 200 patients before his arrest in 1998.)The man I meet is affable, easy company, with the fluency of thought and speech of someone accustomed to commanding an audience. Tall and long-limbed, with piercing blue eyes and tousled grey hair, he is relaxed in off-duty casuals.He has two children — Chris, 37, a vet, and Anna, 35, a hospital pathologist — from his first marriage to Jen, another doctor, and two grandchildren. When he married Linda, a widow, in 2008, he became stepdad to her three grown-up girls.Revealed: Orla Kiely and husband paid themselves £400,000 as...British museums and US hedge funds battle over £15m Titanic...Share this articleHis marriage to Jen, which ended in orce, was a casualty of their demanding careers. \u0027Our lives were hectic and complicated and our relationship sagged beneath our workloads,\u0027 he says. \u0027One of us was always rushing in as the other rushed out.\u0027His job consumed him. Once, his children walked unannounced into his study to find him stabbing a pillow with a ruler, trying to work out the mechanics of a murder.His ambition to become a forensic pathologist took root early when, as a schoolboy, he became enthralled by a textbook on the subject.When he dissected his first cadaver, the initial fear and revulsion was quickly usurped by a fascination that absorbs him to this day.He writes of a \u0027sense of wonder\u0027 at the human body: \u0027Its intricate systems, its colours and, yes, its beauty. For blood is not just red, it is bright red. The gall bladder is not just green, it is the green of jungle foliage. The brain is white and grey — and that is not the grey of a November sky, it is the silver-grey of darting fish. The liver is not a dull school-uniform brown, it is the sharp red-brown of a freshly ploughed field.\u0027He says he learnt early in his career to isolate himself from the horror of the bodies he dealt with every day, while engaging fully with the intricate business of examining them.He also had to learn to leave the sights of the mortuary behind as he walked through the door and out into \u0027the world of daylight, children and home\u0027.He wonders now whether this continual slipping between horror and mundanity might have precipitated his breakdown. \u0027It became harder and harder to clear the images from my mind,\u0027 he admits.          Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex ride by carriage following their wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018 in WindsorI ask, too, how he dealt with friends\u0027 fascination about his work. When he carried out the second autopsy on Princess Diana, for example, he must have been besieged by questions. \u0027People asked: \u0027Was she beautiful?\u0027 \u0027Was she peaceful?\u0027 \u0027Was she pregnant?\u0027 he recalls. \u0027I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadn\u0027t already appeared in the Press.\u0027Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they\u0027re pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?\u0027He leaves the question hanging, adding: \u0027I wish I could say she would have died whatever happened, but the fact is, if she had worn her seatbelt she would have been here for Prince William and Harry\u0027s weddings.He believes that, had she been strapped in, \u0027she would have walked away with a black eye or maybe a broken arm, but nothing more. Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces.\u0027He says, too, that there is no enhancement of the procedures and protocols, no extra level of care or commitment, for celebrities or royals apart from a more senior police officer being present.          Forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd (pictured) featured on Autopsy on NetflixHe recalls other high-profile cases: it was he who suggested that a forensic psychologist should be flown in from the U.S. to help solve Rachel Nickell\u0027s murder. And long before Colin Stagg was acquitted of the crime, Richard suspected that the actual killer, Robert Napper — now remanded indefinitely in Broadmoor high-security hospital — was guilty.He did so because he carried out a post-mortem on one of Napper\u0027s subsequent victims, Samantha Bisset, and noted similarities in the method of the two young mothers\u0027 murders both had been stabbed in a frenzied way.He is an expert on knives: he notes the angles at which blades penetrate flesh, the bruises made by the hilt, marks that indicate whether a wound is self-inflicted. And he has developed the capacity to sketch a murder weapon accurately by the track it leaves on a body. Invariably, he can also identify a knife used in a stabbing.\u0027I was always rooting around in the kitchen at home for a knife to stick into a joint of meat,\u0027 he says. \u0027I\u0027d use pork bellies, cow kidneys and joints of beef for stabbing exercises.\u0027He remarks that when he was called to perform a routine post-mortem on a young black man called Stephen Lawrence, who had been fatally stabbed, he had no idea he would give evidence so many times at future dates about the 18-year-old\u0027s murder.\u0027Public scorn at the failure to arrest Stephen\u0027s attackers reached such a pitch that it really began to seem that demands for an inquiry into the Met\u0027s investigative failures would be met,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027I was delighted by the strong move for change which forced a rethink in official and police culture.\u0027He has seen great advances, too, in methods of identifying bodies.Until 2000, fingerprints and dental records were used. He recalls the furore among relatives of those drowned in the Marchioness disaster when, advised not to see their loved ones\u0027 bodies as they were decomposed, it later emerged that some victims\u0027 hands had been removed for identification.\u0027In their position I would have been angry too,\u0027 Richard concedes. But breakthroughs in DNA technology meant that by the time of the 911 attacks, the dead could be identified swiftly by minuscule fragments of material alone.For those who worry that autopsies involve desecration or disfigurement of the dead, Dr Shepherd offers reassurance.\u0027When I perform a post-mortem, I am ascertaining the exact cause of death and doing my job with care and respect. And after I\u0027ve discovered the truth, the bodies are restored faithfully by mortuary technicians.\u0027I don\u0027t feel grief as I incise a body, but I do when I see others suffering their loss.\u0027Unnatural Causes: The Life And Many Deaths Of Britain\u0027s Top Forensic Pathologist, by Dr Richard Shepherd, is published by Michael Joseph."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/18/5021EDAC00000578-0-image-m-53_1536859532766.jpg","title":"Yoko Ono hand picked mistress John Lennon covered took lover","story":"    View of the back cover of the record album \u0027Two Virgins,\u0027 by John Lennon and Japanese-born artist Yoko Ono in 1968After nearly five years of being together, night and day, the myth of perfect love the couple had woven around themselves — ‘like Cathy and Heathcliff’ as Yoko liked to say in reference to Wuthering Heights — had been shattered.Sex was the last thing on his mind when John Lennon, then aged 25, was first introduced to Yoko Ono.The year was 1966. He’d wandered into the basement of an art gallery, where a very small Japanese lady in black, peering out from between two curtains of hair, was busily preparing an exhibition. It was called Unfinished Paintings And Objects By Yoko Ono, and was due to open the following day.Yoko — then aged 33 — didn’t recognise John. Then a little-known conceptual artist, she was on a visit to London with her husband and daughter and had seized a rare opportunity to publicise her work.To John, however, it all seemed very silly at first. But he liked silliness, so he decided to go along with it.‘Anyway, I’m looking for the action, and I see this thing called Hammer A Nail,’ he recalled. ‘It’s a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it, and a bunch of nails at the bottom, and I said: “Can I hammer a nail into it?” She said: “No”, and walked away.’But when the gallery owner told Yoko she’d just said ‘No’ to John Lennon, she walked straight back and asked him for five shillings.John said he didn’t have five shillings because he never carried money. ‘What if I give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer in an imaginary nail. Would that be all right?’ he asked.Yoko agreed that it would indeed be all right.At that point, he knew nothing about her, other than the fact that she was making a short movie, Bottoms (Film No. 4), having put an advertisement in a newspaper for ‘intelligent-looking bottoms’. She’d then filmed 365 of them.Was he attracted to Yoko? Unlikely. If he had been, she’d have known about it, because he certainly wasn’t shy about making his intentions clear. Yet there was something intriguing about her. She might seem half-crazy but she was an enigma, and he’d never met anyone like her before.One day, this odd little Japanese woman would change his life. But back then, John didn’t give her much thought he didn’t even go to her exhibition launch.Yoko, however, decided to pursue John by letter. Viewing him as a multi-millionaire with money to burn, she was determined to win his financial backing for her art.The idea that she ran after John, she’d say later, wasn’t true. Others might say she never left him alone.Finally, in October 1967, John caved in, agreeing to sponsor an exhibition that consisted of half of everything — a bed, a chair and a room — all painted white. He didn’t actually turn up to see it, but Yoko was starting to get under his skin.Then, to his wife Cynthia’s surprise, the Japanese lady turned up at a private meeting. The Lennons and the other Beatles had gone to see the assistant to the Maharishi, an Indian yogi whom they all planned to visit at his Himalayan ashram.\u0027It\u0027s an incredible day for me to finally go to bed with...They\u0027ll need a hedge fund! Owners of world\u0027s highest...More than just a ticket to ride! Stars come out for Paul...John Lennon broke up the Beatles, NOT Yoko: Paul McCartney...Share this articleYoko was already there when they walked in, sitting in a corner armchair. She didn’t explain her presence and John appeared not to notice her.Afterwards, things got even odder. As John and Cynthia walked towards their chauffeur-driven car, Yoko climbed in ahead of them. Even John looked surprised, Cynthia recalled, though he politely asked Yoko if they could give her a lift anywhere.‘Yes, please,’ Yoko said, giving the chauffeur her address. The journey passed in complete silence.‘What was all that about?’ Cynthia asked John afterwards. He said he didn’t know. What he didn’t say was that he’d already seen Yoko several times.A few months before, he’d invited her to a Beatles session at Abbey Road. She had not been bowled over. ‘Why don’t you do something more complex?’ she asked.John had then suggested they go to an assistant’s flat, where he confidently expected to have sex with Yoko. But she’d found his approach crude.Her rejection only made her seem more beguiling and mysterious. By the following month, John had decided that when he went to India, he’d take both Cynthia and Yoko with him — but he lost his nerve at the last minute. Had Yoko still expected to be going to India when she turned up at the meeting? It would appear so.Unwittingly, Cynthia made the break-up easier for John by going on two holidays in quick succession in 1968. After the first, she came home to find John and Yoko — wearing the Lennons’ towelling bathrobes — sitting cross-legged on the floor.It was obvious they’d spent the night together, but Cynthia gave John another chance. The next time he didn’t even wait for her to get home: he sent a minion to Italy to tell her he wanted a orce.The little Japanese lady had won. That same week, in May 1968, the new couple went public, with Yoko clinging to John’s protective arm.In private, he made her write down a list of all the men she’d slept with before they met.Then, as he told me, he made a list for her of all the serious affairs he’d had, going right back to girls in Liverpool whom Cynthia had known nothing about.          John Lennon and May Pang - John Lennon and May Pang, who was wife Yoko\u0027s secretary, had an affair at the end of 1970sSoon John and Yoko would dress in matching white suits, both parting their long hair down the middle. For John, it was a matter of ‘I am he as you are he as you are me and we are altogether’, as he’d sung in I Am The Walrus.In The Beatles, he’d always seen himself as the front man, but now he began to subsume his personality into that of Yoko. One of their first joint enterprises was to make a narcissistic film that merged their faces together.They were now a brand — ‘JohnandYoko’ — and John threw his energies into promoting it. There was Yoko’s balloon event — 365 white ones bearing the message ‘You are here’ were released — then a film of John smiling, which lasted over 30 minutes.Most critics viewed these as no more than Yoko’s vanity projects. For ‘JohnandYoko’ to catch the public imagination, they needed to do something seriously outrageous. So they did. John decided to have them both photographed naked from the back and front, and to use the images on their first joint LP, Unfinished Music No 1: Two Virgins.Then there was a film, Self Portrait, that focused for 20 minutes on John’s private parts. Yoko was at last becoming famous.As work began on a new Beatles LP — The White Album — John insisted she be with him in the studio. The first major casualty was the Lennon-McCartney songwriting relationship.Paul later told me: ‘If I started to think of a line, I’d begin to get very nervous. I might want to say something like “I love you, girl”, but with Yoko watching I always felt that I had to come up with something clever and avant-garde.‘John and I tried writing together a few more times, but I think we both decided it would be easier to work separately.’As PAUL freely admitted, he was annoyed with John, and jealous of Yoko. But he bit his lip and tried to keep his feelings to himself.‘It’s going to be a comical thing in 50 years’ time,’ he told George Harrison, ‘if people say that The Beatles broke up because Yoko sat on an amp.’Amps weren’t the half of it.Later, after Yoko suffered a whiplash injury when John pranged their car during a driving tour of Scotland, four porters wheeled a bed into the studio so she could watch proceedings in comfort, propped up on pillows.The fun was going out of being a Beatle. And, in private, John was now indulging in a far more dangerous kind of fun: heroin. Yoko had tried some at a party and enjoyed it, so he decided to have a go himself.Soon he was hooked. ‘I never injected,’ he’d say. ‘Just sniffing, you know.’ But he rarely did anything he liked by halves, so his denial is questionable.John — who’d always had a callous streak — would speak to Cynthia only once more before the orce. ‘My final offer is £75,000,’ he told the woman he’d once loved to distraction. ‘That’s like winning the pools for you.

Interestingly, Yoko was less keen than her lover on remarrying. ‘I didn’t like the idea of limiting myself to one man again,’ she said, though she eventually agreed to a low-key wedding in Gibraltar.John was jubilant at having married into the avant-garde intelligentsia.

Tantash accused Mr Rice (pictured) of breaching a 21-clause deal in which she loaned him money in return for him providing the intimacy missing from her lifeMr Rice and the woman received thousands of calls, and Tantash, who describes herself online as a creative design manager, was recorded telling her love rival she looked like a horse and quizzing a third colleague about their relationship.She also sent abusive emails from anonymous accounts.

They introduced me to a community beyond family and school. They were seductive and aspirational. I remember seeing Rolling Stone for the first time in a Belfast boutique in 1968 while wondering if I could afford a Ben Sherman shirt. It was a revelation, voicing a cultural shift that I only hazily understood but knew I wanted to be part of. I bought the magazine, not the shirt. Little did I know, its co-founder, Jann Wenner, would be my boss 24 years later.Like any business, a magazine’s first job is to make money for the owner, and that has traditionally been done through advertising and copy sales. The newsstand cover is crucial in this and the industry has spent millions over the decades trying to find the magic cover formula. Some titles have come close, such as the US weekly People, whose covers have been calibrated with particular brilliance. The received thinking goes something like this. A mainstream cover should be instantly recognisable it should have an attractive, accessible photograph with strong eye contact (we read the picture before the text and we prefer photography to illustration or pure type because it takes less time to decode) plus an easily digestible and relatable mix of cover lines peppered with the odd surprise it should have a tone of warm, light banter and one of the dominant colours should be “buy-me” red.But the covers in Uncovered are different – their newsstand numbers fluctuated between the dismal and the dynamic. I chose them because they broke boundaries and started conversations. They made a moment feel red-hot and meaningful. Some confronted taboos about race and sex. Some ridiculed hypocrisy. Some memorialised a catastrophic event. Some provided a voice that was absent from the mainstream. Some were rallying calls. Some bordered on the crude. Some turned design conventions upside down. Some ended up hanging in galleries, such as George Lois’s Esquire covers, exhibited in New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 2008.They are social documents with unique backstories. I wanted to hear these from the creative mavericks behind them. That’s why I start in the late 1950s prior to this, key players are unavailable. I end when covers were re-energised by the twin political thunderbolts of Brexit and Donald Trump, and the warp speed of the political news cycle. Today, there is an overwhelming sense that the post-1945 magazine era is ending. The internet has taken over as the engine of popular culture and decimated the print business model. On the bright side, there has been a surge of handsome independent niche titles, but as yet their pulling power is limited. With technology, the barriers to producing magazines have never been lower, but those to achieving success have never been higher.So what of magazines’ future? The former Spy editor Kurt Andersen hits the nail on the head: “Eventually, they’ll become like sailboats,” he says. “They don’t need to exist any more. But people will still love them, and make them and buy them.”Uncovered: Revolutionary Magazine Covers is published by Cassell (£30) on 4 October.

O was launched in April 2000 by Hearst and Oprah Winfrey, the entertainment mogul and philanthropist. This image of the magazine’s founder hit a national nerve, prompted “Froprah” mania and clocked up over 337m media impressions. The issue won two National Magazine awards in 2014.Lucy Kaylin: The topic of hair has deeply personal, psychological and political implications… the idea was to start a big, fun, frank conversation about it. As for the cover, we thought: “Let’s see if Oprah would collaborate on a really bold hair moment”. Adam Glassman, our cover magician, knew a wig maker, Kim Kimble. Andre Walker, Oprah’s long-time hairstylist, did an amazing job making it look natural on Oprah. Luckily, our cover model was very much into it. That was the secret sauce: Oprah’s enthusiasm.Adam Glassman: We made it as big and curly as possible. It was like, “OK, I want to be liberated and wear my hair natural like it is when I come out of the shower.” We’ll do an exaggerated version of that. The wig came on a headstand in a bright-pink travel box. It was like the unveiling of the crown jewels. We listened over and over to the soundtrack of The Lion King because Oprah felt like a lioness with this mane of hair. When we showed it to people before we went to press, they were very ided. Some asked if it was too much of a political statement. It really was not the intention.In the early 1970s National Lampoon, the satirical monthly created by Harvard graduates Henry Beard, Doug Kenney and Rob Hoffman, was the incarnation of hip for its predominantly campus-based readership. Its notorious January 1973 cover began as a proposed subscription campaign: “If you don’t subscribe, we’ll kill this dog and, if that doesn’t work, a cat, and the animal death toll will rise until you do.” The campaign did not run but it was the perfect cover for the death-themed issue. “The shot was extremely hard to get,” British-born Tony Hendra recalls. “When the dog looked straight out at the reader he simply appeared victimised. Then someone had the notion of actually pulling the trigger. The dog reacted to the noise and this was the result.”Without National Lampoon, there probably would not have been Saturday Night Live. It incubated talents like John Belushi, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner. Hendra, there from the start, had come from the comedy duo Hendra and Ullett, regular performers on US TV variety shows in the 1960s.Tony Hendra: The level of censorship on American television in the 1960s was acute. It basically meant that people of my generation could not mention or discuss any of the things that were on our minds, whether it was the sexual revolution, or liberation of any kind, and certainly not the Vietnam war. So it was a source of explosive frustration. Going to the Lampoon was like walking out of a dark room into sunlight.The dog cover was Ed’s idea. Casting was obviously crucial and the dog we eventually got was modelled on Freckles, my very sweet mutt who had a big patch on one eye. In a funny way, it was more moderate than a lot of the other covers we did around that period but it did nail the fact that what is really sacred for every American family is pets. So that was what gave it, if you’ll excuse the expression, legs. Were people outraged by it? Absolutely. We certainly couldn’t do that cover today without being shot, or banned for ever.From 1962 to 1972, Madison Avenue art director George Lois and American Esquire editor Harold Hayes created some of the most original, ideas-rich, uncompromising and incendiary covers in magazine history. Lois often worked with the photographer Carl Fischer, Lois creating the concept, drawing a tight sketch of each idea and directing them, and then Fischer bringing it to life.“People would say to me, ‘You got some balls doing those covers.’” says Lois. “I would say, ‘No, it’s Harold who has the balls.’ There’s no editor in the world who would do that now – allow me to choose the article in the upcoming issue, and then accept each cover I created with appreciation and pleasure.”“An Esquire cover of me drowning in a can of Campbell’s soup? I love it! But George, aren’t you gonna have to build a giant can of soup?”So said Andy Warhol to George Lois when he heard the cover concept. Lois had already done multiple photomontage covers for Esquire, but this visual joke – part mocking, part homage – ranks as one of his finest. “You could look at it as just funny, or you look at it as how fame swallows people – the absurdity of fame,” he later said. “But he really stood for something. Pop art was ludicrous to me, but I could see why it was catching on.”Carl Fischer: The basic shot was a soup can with the dirty lid open a certain amount so that we could get the logo in. I spent the day dropping children’s marbles, one by one, into the soup. We did a million splashes and finally got one that made a nice hole to drop Andy into.I photographed Warhol a lot. His mother and he lived up the block from me on Lexington. He would do anything to be on a cover of a magazine – and for no money. He ran an ad once in the Village Voice saying he was available for endorsing products.We had him come into the studio and said: “You’re falling into the ocean, just about to drown and you’re dying.” We did a whole bunch of pictures of him with his arms up, his arms out, screaming, whatever. George sent it out to a retoucher and they put the two shoots together.Cover caption: “Every day, people start out in the hope of a better life. We dedicate this issue to you. An especially large number of the refugees coming to Germany are from Arab countries. That’s why Zeit Magazin appears in German and Arabic.”The weekly newspaper Die Zeit launched Germany’s first magazine supplement in 1970. , introduced a double cover, two consecutive photographs, illustrations or type treatments that make a pithy point. This was a special on refugees that Simon Kuper from the Financial Times read “open-mouthed” because it “presented refugees not as helpless mute victims on sinking boats but as grownup humans with insights into their adopted country”.Christoph Amend: I had the idea in the last days of 2014, when I read the first reports about refugees making their way to central Europe. To edit, design and produce the issue was highly sensitive, so we hired Mohamed as a guest editor.Mohamed Amjahid: All the text had something to do with the new lives of refugees in Germany: learning a new language, fighting bureaucracy, getting over homesickness, facing racism. The issue featured many new citizens, not only those from Arabic-speaking countries. However, we decided to publish the texts in Arabic and German since most of the arriving people in 2015 spoke Arabic.Jasmin Müller-Stoy: We split every page into two. Arabic type is read from right to left, but our InDesign wasn’t able to type the Arabic font in the right direction. We had to figure out how to turn the cover in one direction so you can read it as German, and turn it in the other direction to read it as Arabic.MA: I sometimes turned the monitors upside down because it was easier or I printed the pages out, putting them in the middle of the room and running in circles. I am one of the few German journalists who speak Arabic as a mother language and I was the only one at the magazine who could read the whole issue. I felt a huge pressure. It was hard to translate the texts so they made sense at the same time.JM-S: It was tricky to choose a colour for the cover. We first thought about green, but not all Arabian countries have green in their flag and we didn’t want anybody to feel excluded. So we decided to take a neutral colour. Yellow seemed to be perfect. Mohamed helped us find a font that looked modern. We had this idea to use the first pictures that refugees took in Germany inside. They really appreciated this. We tried to do extra copies so they could get them. We took the magazine to several refugee camps in Germany.MA: Was there a message? Refugees welcome. Many German subscribers were amazed. Of course, some rightwing supporters complained that “their Germany will disappear now” because we had published in Arabic.CA: We never had so many requests from organisations and schools for extra copies. Friends from the magazine industry in New York wrote, saying: “We could never do that in America.” It was quite a ride to publish half of a magazine that you can’t read yourself.August 1958Magazine editor: Don SlaterArt director: Eve ElloreeCover artist: Dawn FredericksAlfred Kinsey’s 1948 book Sexual Behavior in the Human Male said that over a third of American men had had same-sex contacts and helped inspire the homophile movement. One came out of that political movement. The idea was to bring all gay people together as “one”.One’s cover artists and editors had to fashion a visual style that would evoke gayness yet avoid inciting backlash from postal authorities, vice squads or censorship groups. Most of the illustrations were drawn by two women who were a couple. A commercial artist named Joan Corbin drew under the pseudonym Eve Elloree during the 1950s, and in the 60s Dawn Fredericks took over: a rare example of female creative control.Their illustrations were non-threatening: the homophile organisations of the 50s were assimilationist they wanted to be accepted by society. What’s striking about this cover is how big the words are – huge letters proclaiming that in a shocking, daring way. But it’s not a menacing image. I’d describe it as a prideful stoicism that says: “I have a right to exist.” Craig M LoftinCraig M Loftin is lecturer in American studies at California State University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20519712140963dd1e306a36ef01803b4f9a6d2c/277_0_8411_5049/master/8411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52505258e2b4a430ce4fbe212b899ad8","title":"yayoi kusama infinity film victoria miro exhibition","story":"After spending the past four decades in a psychiatric hospital, her name written out of art history, Yayoi Kusama became an art-world phenomenon in the age of the selfieIn the past five years, more than 5 million museum visitors have queued – and queued some more – for a brief glimpse of the work of Yayoi Kusama. The 89-year-old Japanese artist, who for the past 41 years has lived voluntarily in a psychiatric hospital, has had large-scale solo shows of her work in Mexico City, Rio, Seoul, Taiwan and Chile, as well as major touring exhibitions in the US and Europe. Last year, she opened her own five-storey gallery in Tokyo. The Broad museum in Los Angeles recently sold 90,000 $25 tickets in an afternoon to its Kusama exhibition, causing the LA Times to ask if the artist was now “Hotter than Hamilton?”As the numbers have gone up, so the time that each visitor can spend in Kusama’s installations – her immersive “infinity mirror rooms” of coloured lights, and painted pumpkins and polka dots that reflect for ever – has gone down. In 2013 the David Zwirner gallery in New York was restricting time slots to 45 seconds for each viewer. Five years on, visitors to the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC, who queued for more than two hours, were down to a brisk half a minute.This autumn sees more new work on display at the Victoria Miro gallery in London – only two years since its last open-all-hours event. The exhibition coincides with the UK release of a film about the artist’s extraordinary life, Kusama: Infinity. The story of the making of the film is indicative of the ways Kusama’s fortunes have soared. Its director, Heather Lenz, first tried to get the idea off the ground in 2001. She pitched the story to every production company she could think of and was told the same thing by all of them. Her idea was “too arty”, Kusama had “no name recognition”, and “no one wants to watch a movie about a woman artist”. No longer.Speaking on the phone last week, Lenz acknowledged that the smartphone-friendly nature of the work is clearly part of the attraction – but said that should only lead to a deeper understanding of Kusama’s career.“Most people have seen her work on Instagram,” Lenz says, “but when they hear what she had to go through to achieve the success that eluded her for so long, they really connect with that. We did a few screenings and though most people knew the work, out of an entire audience only two people knew for example that she lived in a psychiatric hospital.”Lenz’s film reveals how Kusama’s life has been if anything more estranging than her obsessive work, and the ways in which one informs the other. It does it no harm as a tale of perseverance and triumph that it falls into neat chapters of Kusama’s self-transformation.In the first of these, Kusama’s childhood, the curious seeds of the art world’s favourite selfie-craze were sown. Kusama was born into a wealthy family in rural Japan that managed extensive plant nurseries, growing varieties of violets and peonies and zinnias to sell all over the country. From a very young age Kusama would carry her sketchbook down to the seed-harvesting grounds and sit among the flowers until, as in a fairytale – of the Grimm kind – one day she experienced the flowers crowding in and talking to her. “I had thought that only humans could speak, so I was surprised the violets were using words. I was so terrified my legs began shaking.” This was the first of a series of disturbing hallucinations – she calls them depersonalisations – that haunted her childhood.Those episodes seem to have been connected to the dislocations of her home life. Kusama grew up in a deeply unhappy family. Her father was a philanderer and her mother sent Kusama to spy on him with his mistresses, though when she reported back, she recalls in her autobiography, “my mother would vent all her rage on me”.Her mother tried to stop Kusama from painting – tearing the canvas from her hands and destroying it – insisting that she studied etiquette in order to make a good arranged marriage. Kusama kept on drawing. It was her way of making sense of her hallucinations: flowers from the tablecloth that enveloped her and chased her upstairs sudden bursts of radiance in the sky. “Whenever things like this happened I would hurry back home and draw what I had seen in my sketchbook… recording them helped to ease the shock and fear of the episodes,” she recalls.Many of the motifs that have become her trademarks were, apparently, rooted in this practice. The first pumpkin Kusama saw was with her grandfather. When she went to pick it, it began speaking to her. It was the size of a man’s head. She painted the pumpkin and won a prize for it, her first, aged 11. Eighty years on, her largest silver pumpkin sculptures sell for $500,000.After the attack on Pearl Harbor, when Kusama was 13, she was conscripted to work in a factory that produced fabrics for parachutes. In the evening, she painted intricate flowers over and over. The local paper, in a notice of her first exhibition, reported her producing 70 watercolours a day.Seeing stills of Kusama’s early life in Lenz’s documentary – her hair cut straight across her forehead, photographed among flowers – makes a stark and moving contrast to footage of the artist at work in her studio now. The same slightly bulbous eyes peer out from under a red wig as she joins up her dots with a magic marker, chewing her lip like a child. “To me,” Lenz says, “Kusama’s childhood trauma was instrumental in her work not just because of her difficult family, but also because of her society and the nightmare of the second world war.”Lenz came to understand these pressures more keenly because while making the film she herself married into a Japanese family and learned the history of her husband’s grandfather, killed by the bomb at Hiroshima, and her mother- and father-in-law who had an arranged marriage. “That gave me a greater understanding of her childhood,” she says. “The expectations of the time for a young lady, an arranged marriage, kids. Kusama boldly made the decision to leave Japan and go to New York while that was a pretty shocking thing to do.”That second chapter of Kusama’s journey began when she first encountered the work of Georgia O’Keeffe in a bookshop in Matsumoto, her home town. She found O’Keeffe’s address in New Mexico and wrote to her for advice about how she could make her way in the New York art world, sending some of her own intricate watercolours of surreal vegetal forms and exploding seed pods. O’Keeffe replied, puzzled at first why anyone, let alone a young woman in rural Japan, might want to do such a thing, but the curiosity developed over several years to a kind of mentorship. “In this country an artist has a hard time making a living,” O’Keeffe replied. “You will just have to find your way as best you can.”Kusama arrived in New York in 1958, aged 27, with a few hundred dollars sewn into the lining of her dresses, along with 60 silk kimonos and some drawings. Her plan was to survive by selling one or the other.In her own account, she subsisted initially on scraps of food including fish heads scavenged from the fishmonger’s rubbish, which she boiled for soup. She trailed her work around the city. “One day,” she recalls in her autobiography, “I carried a canvas taller than myself 40 blocks through the streets of Manhattan to submit it for consideration at the Whitney Annual. My painting was not selected and I had to carry it 40 blocks back again. The wind was blowing hard that day and more than once it seemed as if the canvas would sail up into the air, taking me with it. When I got home I was so exhausted I slept like the dead for two days.”Her breakthrough works, the Infinity Net paintings, emerged from an earlier series of watercolours entitled Pacific Ocean, which she had made in response to watching the tracery of waves on the surface of the sea when she had flown for the first time from Tokyo. The nets she painted were made from a repetitive singular gesture of impasto in little loops, like interlocking scales the longest canvases measured 30ft. One of these canvases sold in 2014 for $7.1m, a record for a living female artist. The first ones she sold to fellow artists Frank Stella and Donald Judd in 1962 for $75.For a while, Judd and Kusama lived in the same building on 19th Street in Manhattan. “She would sit around my apartment and talk, or I’d go down there and we’d talk,” Judd recalled in an interview in 1988. “She’d work right through the night, as far as I could tell. Most paintings were done in one shot. I don’t understand how she could do that, but she would start in a corner and then go across.”One of the startling things about watching Lenz’s film is the way that Kusama seemed to be written out of pop art history. There was a point in the 60s when she shared almost equal billing – and notoriety – with the likes of Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg. Part of this eclipse seems to have been by design – Kusama has long claimed that her original ideas were appropriated by the Wasp-ish men around her and passed off as their own.In 1963 she started making chairs and other objects covered, fungi-like, with white painted phallic forms made of stuffed fabric her pièce de résistance was a rowing boat, complete with oars, that she and Judd rescued from a junkyard. It was presented in a box-like space, the walls, ceiling and floor of which were papered with 999 silk-screen images of the phallic boat. She saw it as her own private aversion therapy.“I began making penises in order to heal my feelings of disgust toward sex,” she later wrote. “My fear was of the hide-in-the-closet-trembling variety. I was taught sex was dirty, shameful, something to be hidden. Complicating things even more was all the talk about ‘good families’ and ‘arranged marriage’ and the absolute opposition to romantic love… Also, I happened to witness the sex act when I was a toddler and the fear that entered through my eye had ballooned inside me.”There is a grim irony in this act of therapy in that her technique of “soft sculpture” appears to have been adopted by Oldenburg, and her repetitive wallpaper prints by Warhol. She despaired at the way the men around her found fame with her ideas.Lenz’s film seeks to expose that appropriation. “Every single Q\u0026ampA I do I get a question about how much the allegations that these white male artists stole her ideas were true,” Lenz says. “Obviously I checked all the dates and they all work out as she said. People who had degrees in art history still challenged this though it was as if they don’t want to shift their views. They know what they know, I guess.”Kusama found something like her ideal man in Joseph Cornell, the reclusive genius of the outsider art world, maker of surreal boxes of found objects, and a man who, then in his 50s, had always lived with his mother. Cornell became obsessed with Kusama, sending her a dozen poems a day, never hanging up from a phone call so he was there when she picked it up to dial. This was her only known romantic relationship, though “he didn’t like sex, and I didn’t like sex so we didn’t have sex”. He wasn’t an easy man. One time she was at Cornell’s house and they were sitting on the lawn. Cornell’s mother appeared, struggling up the garden with a large bucket of water. She tipped the contents over them, at which Cornell clung to his mother’s skirt and pleaded with her: “Mother! I’m sorry! Forgive me, but this person is my lover, please do not do such outrageous things.”After that episode Kusama cooled somewhat. She began her first experiments with mirrored infinity, in an octagonal room filled with stuffed phalluses, and became so depressed that on one occasion she jumped from her studio window (her fall was broken by a bicycle).She lost herself in other ways as the 1960s progressed. For one piece in 1966 she walked though some of the rougher neighbourhoods of the city, dressed in full Japanese national costume: kimono, white painted face, her plaited hair fixed with flowers and carrying an ornate parasol. The odyssey is captured in photos. Partly Kusama wanted to present herself as an outsider. Partly she wanted to project her singular identity as far and wide as she could (she had a Warhol-esque mania for fame). She hijacked the 33rd Venice Biennale in 1966 with Narcissus Garden, a lake of 1,500 reflective balls in which the viewer’s face was infinitely multiplied. She sold the balls for $2 each, “your narcissism for sale” read the ad, a gesture that foretold the artwork as selfie. The Biennale authorities stopped the performance, objecting to “selling art like hot dogs or ice-cream cones”.When the summer of love arrived, Kusama sought to position herself as a kind of high priestess of flower power, staging “Body Festivals” and “Anatomic Explosion happenings” in which she painted naked partygoers with polka dots. She took these happenings to sites around New York – opposite the New York Stock Exchange, on the steps of the Statue of Liberty – creating nude protests against the election of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam war. Jeanette Hart, one of her dancers in these performances, recalls how she first heard about Kusama from a friend, who said the artist would let Hart stay at her studio for nothing if she could paint her. “I was thinking ‘portrait’,” Hart remembers. “It never occurred to me that it meant literally ‘paint me’.” Kusama’s happenings appeared on the front page of the Daily News twice in one year: “Nudies dance on Wall St and the cops don’t pinch ’em.”On 25 November 1968 she staged – half a century ahead of its time – New York’s first “homosexual wedding”, for which she had created a “wedding dress for two”. She sold polka dot fashion designs from a boutique, with holes to reveal breasts and buttocks, which cemented her notoriety not only in America but also in her native – and deeply conservative – Japan. She was the scandalous exile. Media interest in her work had shifted from serious critical attention to exposés in the tabloids where her name became synonymous with skin painting and orgies.As the 70s backlash against 60s excesses began, and having become something of an outcast in New York, Kusama returned to Japan. She was deeply affected by the death of Joseph Cornell in 1972, and by her father two years later. She rented an apartment on the 10th floor of a tower block in Shinjuku, Tokyo, overlooking a large cemetery, and began to work on an elegy to Cornell in surreal collages. The hallucinations and panic attacks of her adolescence returned with full force, however, and she was hospitalised several times. In Lenz’s film there is some footage from an art project that saw Kusama alone in a park in the city, submerged under a seething pile of silk, unable to escape. In March 1977 she admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital.For some artists this might have been the end of things, but for Kusama it represented a new start. She found a way to manage her mania, and direct it toward her creativity. The hospital offered art therapy courses. She signed up, and never left.Kusama does not do interviews, but in the course of researching this story I was invited to ask her three questions about her curious life by email. What do you say? This businesslike exchange went as follows: “Was the enormous recognition you have received relatively late in your career a surprise to you? Did you ever lose faith in it happening?”“Long ago,” Kusama wrote back, “I decided that all I could do was express my thoughts through my art and that I would continue to do this until I died, even if no one was ever to see my work. Today, I never forget that my artworks have moved millions of people all around the world.”What have been the advantages for you of living in a psychiatric hospital? How has it informed your practice as an artist?“It made it possible for me to continue to make art every day, and this has saved my life.”How do you habitually begin your days in the studio? And how do you end them?“I have been painting, drawing and writing from morning until night every day since I was a child. When I arrive at my studio in the morning, I put on my work clothes and start to paint straight away, and I work right up until dinner time. I don’t rest. I am an insomniac. Even now, if an idea comes to me in the middle of the night, I pick up my sketchbook and draw.”Heather Lenz asked to film at Kusama’s hospital but it was not possible, out of respect for the other patients. Having had this brief exchange with Kusama, I wondered what Lenz made of her curious regime?“I think it was her choice – and that is in no way to belittle any of her traumas or her medical conditions. If you think about it, she had found this location where she was looked after and there was art therapy and it was close to her studio. She wanted to spend her time making her art – and here was a situation where she didn’t have to worry about washing her sheets or cleaning the bathroom or cooking. It is not a bad arrangement. If you look at the history of art, a lot of successful men have had wives or servants do that for them also.”Kusama sleeps at the hospital each night and works in her studio across the road six days a week. She eats sushi from the local supermarket. She makes her own clothes. She apparently has little interest in the wealth that has come to her late in life. She has a small team of assistants in her studio, and gallerists who look after her interests in New York, Tokyo and London. Glenn Scott Wright, co-director at Victoria Miro, is one of them.Scott Wright recalls how he first saw Kusama’s art at Modern Art Oxford in 1989. “I just walked in not knowing much about her and thought ‘these are absolutely amazing’.” He sought out more of her work at an exhibition at the CICA museum in New York later that year, the start of Kusama’s triumphant resurrection in the city, curated by Alexandra Munroe. The first time Scott Wright encountered her in person was at the 1993 Venice Biennale, when she was granted the whole Japanese pavilion. He has watched her star slowly rise over the past 25 years.One reason for this success, he believes, is the need to make amends in some way for the fact that Kusama was never taken up by the art establishment like her male contemporaries. “She was doubly an outsider – a woman, and a Japanese woman. She just wasn’t recognised in the way the white male artists were. In retrospect it is clear she was a very important figure both in minimalism and in pop art. Her work provided a link between the two, which was unique.”As well as that, he argues, Kusama has achieved the rare double of serious critical attention and immense popularity. “At the same time as the Tate retrospective was happening in 2012, including all this wonderful work from the 1950s and 1960s, she was launching a fashion range with Louis Vuitton, perhaps the biggest art and fashion collaboration ever, with thousands of shop windows. I think the nature of her work is that it has always had the capacity for universal appeal. Even from the early shows you could observe people of all ages opening up to it with a real sense of wonder.”Scott Wright goes to see Kusama regularly in Tokyo, probably three times a year. Generally the artist is painting when he arrives at the studio and he waits to let her finish before they discuss any business.“She paints on a flat surface and sits in a chair, but she will get up and move around,” he says. “She is not much interested in hearing art world gossip, she wants to talk about her own work.”I wonder how changed she is by success?“She doesn’t talk about it so much, but she says she always wanted Kusama to be everywhere, so she appreciates that.”The internet has granted Kusama that wish in ways she could not have imagined when she was sitting in her field of peonies as a girl. “I am determined to create Kusama world, which no one has ever done and trodden into,” she once wrote. As a student of narcissism she would perhaps have been amused to hear that one visitor to All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins recently took that desire literally when he stumbled into and shattered a pumpkin while trying to capture a self-portrait in a mirror.Yayoi Kusama: The Moving Moment When I Went To The Universe, is at Victoria Miro gallery, London N1, 3 Oct-21 Dec.

The Sunday papers are alive with stories that Theresa May is weighing up the possibility of seeking public support for her Brexit strategy. Voters could soon be trooping off to polling stations to elect a government for the third time in little more than three years.Given the disastrous result the last time the prime minister went down this route, it seems likely that May would only call a general election as a last resort. That said, the events of the past week mean that anything could happen.Labour is aware of that and will now be kicking itself that it spent the summer embroiled in an internal row about antisemitism rather than devoting all its attention to formulating policies and selling them to the public.The need to reach outwards is particularly important when your policy proposals are radical and the public mood is cynical, yet it was telling that Andrew Marr spent a lot more time on his BBC TV show questioning Jeremy Corbyn about racism than he did about what a Labour government would do in office.Labour’s approach to economic policy has changed fundamentally since the days when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown accepted much of the Thatcherite settlement, thinking the idea was to make markets more efficient and fairer. But Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, believe there is something structurally wrong with UK capitalism that needs to be fixed.In that respect, it is right to say that Corbyn and McDonnell want to turn the clock back to the 1970s and the analysis that underpinned Tony Benn’s Alternative Economic Strategy (AES), the thrust of which was that curing Britain’s economic problems was a supply-side matter that necessarily involved more than simply pumping up demand.Reflation was part of the original AES, but it also included public ownership, economic planning, import controls, industrial democracy, price controls and hostility to what was then called the European Economic Community. This was the pre-globalisation era, but even back then supporters of the AES said multinational companies were gouging consumers through excessive prices, shifting jobs overseas and using transfer pricing to avoid paying UK tax.The similarities with current Labour economic policy are obvious. Certainly, McDonnell would end austerity and increase public spending. But, as with the AES in the 1970s, the critique goes deeper. Put simply, the financial crisis of a decade ago exposed deep flaws in the UK’s economic model that have manifested themselves in low investment, weak productivity, a shrunken manufacturing base and a chronic trade deficit.To an extent, this leaves Labour at the mercy of the financial markets. If the City takes fright at McDonnell’s plans, the result will be that he will have to pay higher interest rates for his extra borrowing, with a dampening impact on growth. This argument – that public borrowing inevitably crowds out private investment – looks less compelling in the light of the massive increase in the budget deficit during and after the financial crisis, which occurred without any significant change to the interest rate paid on government bonds.The need to keep the markets onside does, however, explain why McDonnell has no plans to abolish the operational independence of the Bank of England. There is a simple reason why he has been quietly touring City institutions in the past few months to sell his strategy to the bankers: for Labour to be radical, it also has to be credible.That’s because there is going to be plenty in Labour’s next manifesto that the City and business in general are going to hate. There will be push back against the proposal to require firms that employ more than 250 people to reserve a third of the seats on their boards for worker representatives and to put a chunk of their profits into employee ownership funds.Any Labour supporter who thinks the battle with these entrenched vested interests is going to be easy is kidding themselves. The power of capital – especially financial capital – is far greater than it was when the AES was being pieced together four decades ago.There are those, on both the left and the right, who think this is all academic. The public, they say, did not buy this sort of radical stuff in the 1970s and early 1980s, and will not buy it this time either.This, though, might prove to be yet another false assumption. Thatcherism, a rightwing economic strategy, emerged out of the crisis of social democracy. Today it is conservative economics that is in crisis. As Robert Skidelsky says in his new book, Money and Government, a model that offers such “fabulous rewards to a financial plutocracy” has to be “fabulously successful to command allegiance”. And it isn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/636da5f449d5f0edb72259382db3e06df5dc8a7a/0_117_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76099ad80431ad6de861a240c34ecf0f","title":"opec predicts massive rise in oil production over next five years","story":"Increasing demand from airlines will more than offset reductions from electric carsWorld oil production will soar to new records over the next five years, as a dramatic expansion in demand from airlines offsets the arrival of electric cars, according to a report from Opec.In a forecast that will dismay environmentalists – and which questions the theory that oil company reserves will become “stranded assets” – Opec’s annual report significantly revised production estimates upwards. Most of the production increase will come from countries outside Opec, led by explosive growth from frackers in the United States, with China and India leading the increase in demand.Opec expects global oil demand to reach nearly 112m barrels per day by 2040, driven by transportation and petrochemicals. That is up from almost 100m today and higher than last year’s projection.The number of vehicles on roads across the world are expected to leap from 1.1bn now to around 2.4bn in 2040. In its central scenario, Opec expects just 320m of those to be electric, a number that climbs to 720m in a scenario where battery-powered cars take off rapidly.It said that if the higher prediction for electric cars came to pass, oil demand would only slip slightly to 109m bpd rather than 111.7m bpd by 2040, the report said.Opec revised downwards its forecast for the market share of diesel vehicles because of the fallout from the dieselgate scandal and electric strategy announcements by carmakers over the past year.The price of crude oil has jumped from about $50 (£38.29) a barrel in late 2016 to highs of $80 this summer, partly due to the cartel’s agreement with Russia to cut production for 18 months.Although the Opec report shies away from making price predictions, motorists are unlikely to see much in the way of relief on the forecourts. Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency warned there was a risk of oil prices spiralling higher in the coming months, posing a dilemma for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he looks to raise fuel duty.Most oil companies expect peak oil demand will occur in the 2030s, while more bullish predictions say it could come in the 2020s as climate change regulations bite.Opec, which was meeting in Algiers on Sunday to discuss how to share out an increase in output to bring down prices, sees the US as soaking up most of the growth in production over the next 10 years.“US tight oil is projected to grow very strongly in the period 2018–20, albeit slowing a bit thereafter, and to peak … in the latter half of the 2020s,” the World Oil Outlook report said.The report doubts whether the pro-fossil fuel regulatory pushes by the US president, Donald Trump, will help the US oil industry, citing the fact that production soared under the “overly burdensome” regulatory environment it faced under Barack Obama’s presidency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02824a4aeb73660e086e5c63704fa1056ded03ad/0_16_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde7f0eb8405f4d90002312d98cc4e68","title":"brexit chequers salzburg irish sea customs union","story":"The rejection of the Chequers plan at Salzburg was no surprise – the EU will never accept a fudge on the Irish borderDonald Tusk’s clear rejection of Theresa May’s Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit yesterday should not come as a surprise. The most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that it is not a negotiation, and never has been. Blessed with superior size, wealth and power, the EU has been able to dictate the framework and substance of the talks, and has refused any deviation from its red lines.The second most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that the EU will prioritise its economic and political cohesion above all else. That cohesion rests on two key outcomes: an unided single market and an open border on the island of Ireland.It is these principles that have led us to Salzburg. The EU will not accept the Chequers plan, which proposes a single market in goods but not in services, capital or people. It will also not accept any possibility of border infrastructure in Ireland, which is anathema to Dublin and, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, presents a credible risk of sectarian violence. That has duly paved the way for the Brexit endgame, which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has now confirmed: there will be a border for goods in the Irish Sea.The EU does not, however, want to antagonise or humiliate the UK, and has scrambled to defuse the drama of this development. Barnier stresses that most checks between Britain and Northern Ireland will take place in offices and warehouses, and only live animals and food products will need to be examined at ports themselves. But no amount of diplomatic politesse can conceal Brexit’s reality: one part of the UK will be economically split from another.Theresa May effectively guaranteed this impasse last December, when she agreed the Irish backstop. The backstop guarantees, as a last resort, Northern Ireland’s alignment with Ireland on the customs union and single market to ensure the free flow of goods. Northern Ireland would be permitted to retain the single market just in goods because the Good Friday agreement depends on it. But no such exemptions would ever be open to the rest of the UK. Although the EU was too coy to admit it at the time, this always meant that the whole UK would have to commit to the prospect of staying in the full single market and customs union, or else concede the erection of trade barriers within its territory.If May had been armed with political judgment, or merely cognisant of reality, she would have prepared the British people – and government – for that concession. She has instead wasted nine months denying she ever made it. It comes as little surprise that the EU has now taken the initiative where the UK refused.The prime minister has boxed herself in with promises she cannot keep. She insists on the ability to strike UK-only trade deals and end free movement of people, while refusing to accept its consequences. In Salzburg she announced “the idea that I should assent to the legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories is not credible”, but failed to acknowledge the lack of credibility in any other option. She resembles a desperate fugitive who urgently needs to escape a building but instead keeps inexplicably locking herself inside it.The most problematic consequence of the EU’s proposals is one that Brussels is most loath to spell out. This is not simply about checking goods. If Northern Ireland permanently operates a different customs regime from the rest of the UK and implements EU tariffs, then Northern Ireland must be exempt from any future UK trade deals. But it is almost inconceivable that the DUP – let alone the UK parliament – would ever agree to such a scenario. The DUP leader in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, has referred even to the checking of goods as “separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERMay consequently has two tasks. First, she must determine whether her government would survive opposition to an effective border in the Irish Sea from the DUP and Commons. But more important, she must decide whether she values the economic integrity of the UK more than the ability to unilaterally change Britain’s tariffs and end migration rights for Polish plumbers.The EU, for its part, knows it holds all the cards and recognises the danger of giving ground. Its priority is to accommodate Dublin, not London. It also concludes that a government so determined to leave must believe it can look after itself. Brussels has no reason or incentive to make any better offer.The government has never understood the Brexit process and therefore has always botched it. It expects the EU to treat the UK both as an equally powerful third country, and as a member state still deserving the EU’s protection. It is neither. And so in a battle of red lines, the UK will lose. That is the most brutal lesson of all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e74e3130293264e9dc49f54d5e27301ac41f06/0_0_4537_2724/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188628b0b48c85af41c291785c19a278","title":"european language brexit britain","story":"For someone who occasionally seems unsure whether their wife is Japanese or Chinese, Jeremy Hunt seems to speak pretty good Japanese.Unless bits of it were Chinese, obviously. Given the way things have gone lately for Theresa May’s government we probably shouldn’t rule anything out, but let’s just assume the Tokyo audience he addressed in their native tongue this week wasn’t just being polite and that he did actually deliver the whole speech in the correct language.Lately there has been some tinkering with grade boundaries to encourage uptake. But while mathematicians and scientists have gone to great lengths to popularise subjects once seen as geeky or intimidatingly difficult, there has been no concerted push behind French or Spanish.And if we’re honest, Britain’s solid international reputation for being rubbish at languages isn’t just down to the kids. How many of us slogged through years of irregular verbs and asking the way to the station, only to be reduced in middle age to fumbled holiday conversations in shops and frantic pointing?But watching Hunt reminded me of something I’ve been wondering for a while, which is whether the prospect of leaving Europe will finally make learning a language feel less like a slog and more like a thrillingly subversive act one great defiant two fingers to everything Brexit Britain stands for.Languages are lovely things to learn in their own right, of course, if you’re so minded living, breathing entities that weave in and out of each other, exchanging sounds and words and ideas. But they’re also one of the purest forms of soft power. Speaking to someone in their own tongue is a disarming act, a gesture of empathy and respect. If you’re not actually very good at it then in some ways all the better at least it’s obvious you’re making an effort, which is why typing furiously into Google Translate doesn’t quite have the same effect.Eventually, once they’re good enough to stop occasionally churning out scrambled garbage, robot translators will presumably put human translators out of business. But they’ll still struggle to convey what a human switching between languages does, which is a fundamental willingness to put oneself out in order to put someone else at ease. Speaking foreign languages is about meeting people halfway, building bridges and accepting differences – all skills sorely in need of some practice, judging by the current tone of public\u0026nbspconversation.But above all, languages open so many doors to understanding. There are few better ways of grasping why so many British negotiating gambits flop in Brussels than reading a German newspaper’s take on them. (I still have fond memories of sneaking into French government briefings at EU summits, the gist of which was usually that the French had conclusively won all the arguments, to compare them with the Downing Street version in which oddly enough it was generally the British who had triumphed.)And even to understand the construction of a language can shed light on a different way of thinking. What seems like basic politeness in English sounds almost weirdly apologetic if translated directly into anything from Spanish to Hebrew, while people translating directly the other way can sound rude, abrupt or stilted to English ears even when that’s not remotely the intention. A basic knowledge of how someone’s first language works goes a long way to avoiding small, grating cultural misunderstandings when they’re using their second.It’s true that English remains the lingua franca of big tourist resorts and business conferences. But the trouble with grandly relying on everyone else to speak your language is that it can make you oddly vulnerable. What stubborn monoglots often don’t realise is that they will only ever hear as much as the people around them want them to hear that private conversations and whispered asides will remain a closed book. If you really want to take back control, then learn a language, and with it the small covert thrill of eavesdropping on conversations that people don’t realise you can understand.But it’s Brexit that could turn an abstract intellectual pleasure into a small private act of defiance, both for grieving remainers and for those liberal leavers who actually meant what they said about leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. For those who can’t bear to see Britain defined by belligerent isolationism, who don’t want the rest of the world to think that this is who we are, then one tiny but practical way of showing it is brushing up on a European language and making a determined effort to use it. Cold comfort, obviously, for those who would rather Britain never left at all. But if the great rupture is coming, then we still have a choice over how culturally isolated we become. The least we can do is keep talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2324170e9ea60f30f8c0cb54ee32718d67090cad/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768bc0eb360dee42b509b7cd1c496918","title":"tesco jacks little englandism cornish camembert jacks","story":"The new Tesco chain prides itself on its British products – but it’s really selling the myth of post-Brexit self-sufficiencyJack’s dependence on Europe goes deeper than its shelf-stackers.

Years later, at the bank manager’s suggestion (his staff had trouble telling apart the many Jacob Kohens at the Mare Street branch), Jacob rechristened himself John Edward Cohen – Jack, for short.Now, almost a century after the son of Polish immigrants set up shop on an East End street corner, Tesco is attempting to one-up its continental competitors by vaunting its Britishness, using its founder’s “very British name” as proof. Yet these British credentials are as manufactured now as they were then. Jack’s, in this sense, is not a supermarket at all but rather a parable of Brexit Britain, an impossible dream of a nation sustained by its own wilful ignorance and nostalgic self-regard. Jack’s and its eponymous founder are fundamentally products of Europe, and no amount of Peckham Pecorino is going to change that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3394f844a59051638253cd8dad87722c680664f5/0_272_4329_2597/master/4329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7786dea49005467bc547f99383ce202c","title":"people vote brexit parliament labour","story":"Labour, the movement that prizes members’ democracy above all else, is now strongly in favour of a people’s vote on Brexit: that is the collective decision hovering over the party’s annual conference in Liverpool, and it speaks well of the wisdom of the Labour crowd.The balance of opinion in Liverpool is clear. The question, of course, is whether members will get the chance to vote unambiguously on the matter on the conference floor. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, told the Observer: “If the people’s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it.” Corbyn was more cautious on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, declaring – not unreasonably – that he would prefer a general election: “Let’s see what comes out of conference. Obviously I’m bound by the democracy of our party.” Doesn’t exactly quicken the pulse, does it?All the same, Labour will leave Liverpool clearly committed to a people’s vote, formally or otherwise. In the short term, this will assist Theresa May, who needs all the help she can get (though when does she not?). Humiliated by her soon to be ex-EU partners in Salzburg, she must confront her cabinet colleagues on Monday , many of them convinced that the Chequers deal is indeed pushing up the daisies.But at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, the prime minister and her remaining allies will say that Labour is playing reckless partisan games in the middle of a diplomatic process of great moment, reneging on its commitment to the 2016 referendum result, and proving that it is unfit for government. Indeed, that referendum defines the parameters and trajectory of her premiership: she became PM because a vacancy was created by its outcome. From the start, she characterised herself as the person who would implement that popular decision, by all and any means necessary. Even last year’s snap election – disastrous for her and the Tories – was driven by a desire to strengthen her negotiating mandate in Brussels with a decent majority in Westminster. The great gamble reflected the intensity of her wish to be recalled by posterity as the PM who successfully ushered Britain out of the EU, honouring the wishes of the voters.Trust me, May is more likely to run through fields of wheat – her personal Studio 54, remember – wearing a “Vote Corbyn” T-shirt, singing the Internationale and smoking a reefer than she is to endorse a people’s vote. Her tribe will like it when she scoffs in Birmingham at the proponents of a final say on Brexit, just as they liked the wannabe-Thatcher firmness of her post-Salzburg statement in Downing Street on Friday. Expect to hear a lot about “finishing the job”, “holding our nerve” and “doing what is best for Britain”.Rarely has conference season felt so introspective and confined. At precisely the moment that we should be raising our horizons as a nation and asking how to navigate these treacherous straits, the two main parties are looking inward and reverting to tribal type: fragmented, bickering, scoring cheap points when history is screaming that the time has come for bold thinking and statesmanship.So look ahead. Holding another referendum would indeed be a huge upheaval, suspending and dominating political life – yet again – for months. Under the terms of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the campaign itself would have to last at least 28 days – and that after the official campaign organisations on both sides had been designated. The Electoral Commission would need to endorse a question, which, it is already clear, would be a nightmare. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Labour’s biggest financial backer, said on Sunday that the ballot paper should not include the option to stay in the EU. Confused? You will be.Assume, though, that confronting such dilemmas becomes more attractive than maintaining our present course. Could a people’s vote get through parliament in the first place? Let us say, just for the sake of argument, that Labour (on a three-line whip), the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid and Greens voted more or less en bloc for a final say. That gets you to 309. But deduct perhaps half a dozen pro-Brexit Labour MPs like Kate Hoey defying this putative whip. Back to 303. We now need to get to 320 (the notional majority is 326, but Sinn Féin does not take its seats and the Speaker and three deputies do not vote.)It is true that 176 of the 317 Conservative MPs elected last year also backed remain in 2016. But it is a category error to assume that all of them would back a people’s vote in the Commons ision. To date, only Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Justine Greening, Phillip Lee and Guto Bebb have given public support to a fresh referendum (other Tory MPs are certainly considering their options).Would, say, 20 or more Conservatives break ranks and back a people’s vote? Quite possibly, and for one reason above all others: that the moment may soon be reached when to do otherwise would not only look unpatriotic, but (much worse for most politicians) utterly ridiculous. Only a few months ago, such an outcome would have seemed far-fetched. But the realm of the conceivable is expanding at hectic rate. Just watch. Ditch your preconceptions, and brace for impact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dda0db8a9127dcc42bd3975bd5a282969dccd6a/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c721b997b9eb0db6cbe8bf6041e6afb","title":"on my radar oona chaplin dark crystal doris lessing david hockney aniwa gathering","story":"The actor on her early love of The Dark Crystal, the shifting styles of David Hockney, and a New York gathering of tribal eldersGranddaughter of Charlie Chaplin, Oona Chaplin was born in 1986 in Madrid, Spain. She graduated from Rada in 2007 and, after making her TV debut in Spooks (2007), went on to star in Game of Thrones (2012-13), Black Mirror (2014) and Taboo (2017). She has also joined the cast of James Cameron’s forthcoming Avatar sequels. Her new film, Anchor and Hope, in which Chaplin and Natalia Tena star as a couple living on a houseboat in London, is in cinemas from Friday.Okwui Okpokwasili is a dancer and a choreographer and an incredible woman. Considering the current US situation in race and gender relations, she brings a deep compassion for everybody into dance but at the same time, the fight. She dances like nothing else – her routines are very weird and disturbing – and she makes very strong social commentary with a lot of heart. I’ve seen her twice and both times she’s blown me away. I feel like she understands a lot of things that I want to understand about how society works and how we can heal together.The Canopus in Argos series, Doris LessingThis is amazing. It’s a series of five books that will take you on a cosmic journey across the inner workings of the human psyche. It follows the travels through five realms of a Canopian emissary, Johor, and his allies. I suppose it falls under science fiction, although it’s much more than that. Doris Lessing has a gift for encapsulating the near-understanding of everything: she really gets the fact that we all almost get it at times, and then it slips away. I’d totally recommend it.David Hockney at LACMA, Los AngelesEvery time I go to a David Hockney exhibition my life is richer and fuller afterwards. He sends me into such a deep state of feeling, and I have clarity about where I stand before all of his paintings. I feel he looks at his subjects with a lot of compassion but also fully respects their weirdness. I’m interested in the way he has shifted his style throughout his life: he’s constantly reacted to the world around him as he perceives it, and painted that rather than being stuck in one style. Even the stuff he’s doing on the iPad is mind-blowing.I’m on such a massive journey with music right now – I’m playing and singing more and more – and this is the thing I’m most excited about at the moment. It’s a cultural event happening in New York this month the first one was in Ibiza last year. It’s 30 indigenous elders from all around the world that come to share their music and culture, and put forth projects for permaculture and language rescue and land buy-back. There will be traditional music, a prayer about taking care of Mother Earth, sacred ceremonies involving incense, and hapé, which is a different way of taking tobacco. I’ve been working with a lot of these elders for some years now, so it’s exciting to see all of them come together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02922f4f1970daaf6238d8e3335b6429766c39a8/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e455374342b9439af875a2bed32603f","title":"eight of the best coastal walks in wales","story":"Whether you fancy a stroll with fabulous sea views or a long-distance hike past a medieval castle, you’ll find it all on the coast of WalesThe Welsh coastline has been described as one of the best places on Earth to visit, and it’s not hard to see why. From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

Lots of people have bad memories of being picked last for a team or just feeling really uncomfortable in PE lessons. This programme is designed to stop that happening.”The scheme will run through the national network of teaching school alliances, training teachers in new activities from zumba to volleyball and encouraging school leaders to value PE.Last year the government doubled the funding for PE in primary schools to £320m a year, and 1 million primary school children are now taking part in the Daily Mile running programme, but secondary schools have been without any financial investment or national schemes in the subject for the last decade.A third of pupils leaving primary school are overweight or obese, making it more difficult for secondary school PE teachers to ensure their lessons are inclusive.The former Olympic sprinter Darren Campbell, whose company works in schools, said there was a link between sport and mental health. “Competitive sport is being taken away and it’s becoming all about taking part,” he said. “Life is competitive, just getting a job is competitive. Sport is life lessons, learning how to win and learning how to deal with defeat. We’re failing to prepare young people for disappointment.”Another Olympian, Denise Lewis, welcomed the focus on how teachers delivered PE lessons but expressed concern about what she saw while visiting schools.“The lack of coordination in young people is alarming. I’ve been to schools where children aged nine and 10 just can’t skip,” she said. “It’s great they’re addressing secondary school PE but I still believe that by the time children are in year 6, if they are fitter and more coordinated, they will be more readily keen to participate in exercise at secondary school.”Lewis also highlighted an issue facing teenage girls. “Most girls I see don’t have the correct fitting bras. They’re conscious of their shape while they’re participating in exercise, so they don’t commit fully. They’re participating with the handbrake on because they’re so self-conscious about their body.”She said teachers needed to consider innovative and sensitive ways to support parents in providing appropriate kit. Ross Myhill, the head of PE at Thomas Gainsborough school in Suffolk, one of 40 taking part in a pilot scheme, described the impact it was having, from training teachers to deliver activities such as yoga and handball to making the most of existing facilities through additional after-school clubs.“I’ve been teaching for 15 years and I don’t think there’s been such a hands-on scheme before. You have up to £20k to upskill staff to give secondary school students more opportunities and get them active.“We’ve got a rock climbing wall in school but – and it’s horrible to say it – we don’t have enough money in the school to be able to put people on a rock climbing course to deliver the lessons.”With the new funding, Myhill hopes to be able to offer lunchtime and after-school sessions, as well as opening up the facility to the local community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99cdd592719f6ab0e81fcf4df036aa48c7bda07/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a87fe35576f9aa5a5eeb93bf90f0243","title":"town v gown is the student boom wrecking communities","story":"For some, they represent the very best of British, hubs of learning and commerce attracting the brightest and the best from around the world who bring huge wealth to spend. They can even breathe hope into rundown towns and cities, with the promise of jobs and cash to rejuvenate areas deserted by traditional industries.But for others, Britain’s burgeoning universities are anything but a blessing, as the thousands of students they attract transform the neighbourhoods they move into, raising property prices, disrupting locals’ lives with their exuberant lifestyles, transforming areas that rush to cater for the tastes of their new young clientele. The process has even spawned its own, ugly term – studentification.Last May, local councillor Linda Holt – who later agreed that she had used inappropriate language – said the displacement of permanent residents by students was “a kind of social cleansing”.David Middleton, chair of the Confederation of St Andrews Residents Associations, said: “If it carries on like this we’re not going to have a town left.”These issues are being played out across Britain. Locals, upset at large numbers of students in their midst, recognise the economic boost they bring and stress their main gripe is with the universities and local authorities. The main complaint concerns accommodation, and specifically houses of multiple occupation (HMOs), the shared digs that have taken over town centres and neighbourhoods close to Britain’s 167 higher education institutions.Fife council wants to ban new HMOs in St Andrews. Students say it is their “right” to live in HMOs and are fighting the ban which, after a period of consultation, will be voted on next February. It could be quite a battle: nearly 2,000 students have signed an anti-ban petition and many have registered to vote in St Andrews. A spokesman for the university said an HMO cap “may make affordable accommodation for local people even more scarce”. With a rapid rise in full-time student numbers in the UK – up 660,000 in the last 20 years – there is high demand for student HMOs, which is great news for landlords – some good, some not – but causes problems for locals.According to the National HMO Lobby, a campaign group representing 50 residents’ groups in 30 university towns, it plays out like this: a proliferation of HMOs, which are popular with young professionals, as well as students, skews property prices, which become based on rental income. House extensions and conversions proliferate, often illegally, to squeeze in more bodies. Local authorities cannot afford to employ enough planning inspectors to keep check. Two-bedroom semis become five- and six-bed HMOs. Rubbish piles up, doctors’ surgeries become oversubscribed and shops close when areas become ghost towns out of term time.The noise and partying drives local residents to desperation, prompting more families to move out. Properties in a sea of “To Let” signs look tatty, areas become blighted and ugly. Yet at the same time the houses are unaffordable unless you are an investor. Resident communities are broken, with neighbourhoods lost to studentification.Yet the market changes so fast that in some areas we are already in an era of “destudentification”, as an over-supply of accommodation from new purpose-built blocks means students move on, leaving swathes of empty houses. This, say academics, can lead to “social, cultural, economic and physical decline”.Richard Tyler, chair of the National HMO Lobby, said: “I don’t think the government and many of the universities care very much. Universities want bums on seats, and many don’t really care where those bums go once they’ve vacated the seats.”The situation in Durham and parts of Manchester is extreme. In the past 30 years, the number of students at Durham University has grown from 6,000 to 17,400, and it plans to add another 4,000 by 2027.Most homes in the city centre, Costello said, are not participating in the economy for half of the year. “We have lost our local GP. We believe we are unique in having a Waitrose close for financial reasons.” Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Café Rouge and Pret A Manger have also shut. “All corner shops have gone and our Tesco  sells more vodka than milk during term time,” he added.People living in the south Manchester suburb of Fallowfield believe they have the highest density of students in Europe living in HMOs and halls of residence. It is “party central” for students, some of whom commute to Salford University. Social media allows students to advertise parties far more widely than ever happened before the mid-1990s higher education boom.One said: “You have to see it to believe it. Sometimes we come home and it’s like a festival on our street – hundreds of students on our road at two and three o’clock in the morning. In May, there was a party that went on for three days.“The speakers were incredibly powerful so walls were vibrating in homes on the next street. This is just one house. This story is echoed all around here.”In Brighton, hundreds of former council houses have become HMOs on estates in Moulsecoomb and Bevendean. Families are worried about the future of local primary schools, most recently in Coldean. They are exasperated by antisocial behaviour and furious with rogue developers and landlords.“Some developers have turned three-bedroom family homes into nine-bed HMOs,” said campaigner Jenny Burtenshaw, who helps to run the local social media group Family Homes not HMOs. “The roofs look awful, the gardens are disgusting, there’s rubbish everywhere, left in bags for seagulls and foxes to rip open because nobody in the HMO will take responsibility for it. We can’t let it carry on.”There was no stopping the spread of HMOs in Fallowfield, Durham, Brighton or anywhere else until legislation was enacted in 2010, by which time many neighbourhoods had already been lost to studentification. Until then, anyone could change a family home into an HMO without planning permission but the licensing of larger HMOs became mandatory eight years ago the latest change in housing law means that from next week, thousands more HMOs will also need licences.Local authorities can seek government permission to limit the effects of studentification by imposing stricter conditions on the planning and usage of homes. They can spread the load across the city. Local authorities in Manchester, Wolverhampton, Leeds, Nottingham, Brighton and some London boroughs have imposed tight controls, while others, including Durham, Bath and Chester, have not. Residents in parts of Birmingham are angry that, despite a student population of 70,000, there is no city-wide student housing policy. Overseas students – around 450,000 in the UK – usually prefer to live in purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA), the new “gold rush” for investors. In Coventry alone, there are 22 blocks of managed student rooms being built and more are planned. The rooms often cost more to rent than a house share – for example, an ensuite room in Manchester costs about £6,500 to £7,800 a year – but more British students are being tempted, which is expected to ease the demand for HMOs. The total value of student rentals in 2017 was £4.7bn, according to invest. All student HMOs are exempt from council tax but nobody knows how many there are. Student HMOs do not exist in any planning legislation. “The data is really unclear,” said Professor Darren Smith, an associate dean at Loughborough University, who invented the word “studentification” and has researched its effects for more than 20 years. The problems started, Smith said, during the education boom under New Labour. Students in Britain, more than anywhere else in the world, love to move away from home to study they also love to live close to other students.“So you end up with big concentrations in certain areas. It happened so fast that universities couldn’t provide enough on-campus accommodation. So landlords cashed in. The economic conditions at the time were for cheap mortgages, buy to let, dipping into the retirement pot…”The predicted fall in student numbers over the next four years will be followed by a renewed surge, said Smith. Resident groups want their councils to be able to control the effects when it happens. “Planning law doesn’t reflect student housing,” said Tracey Hill, lead councillor for private rented housing in Brighton. “It should be a separate category.” Brighton’s Labour councillors are making that point in a submission to the Labour party.The National HMO Lobby wants more: a national register of all landlords, and landlords to pay business rates so that local authorities can invest in protecting communities from high concentrations of HMOs.When the Observer sent a questionnaire to the National HMO Lobby, whose volunteers have been campaigning since 2000, the replies totalled 88,604 words, enough to fill a 350-page book.While the main points of contention varied, the most common were about the uncontrolled spread of HMOs a loss of community cohesion shortage of planning enforcement officers lack of university policing of off-campus behaviour by students lack of investment by universities in accommodation encouragement of massive university growth by some local authorities “ghost towns” in the summer and – again and again – antisocial behaviour, especially involving noise and rubbish.Many respondents had themselves been students and pointed out the many benefits to towns and cities of having universities. Even in St Andrews, the residents’ submission on the HMO ban says that both the university and its students were “a great plus for the town”.Will Hutton, an Observer columnist and principal of Hertford College, University of Oxford, said evidence showed the upsides of having a university in any town far outweigh the downsides.“It is no accident that every town with a university is more economically, socially and culturally vibrant than those that do not. Students are sources of vitality, energy and lode–bearers of the new – and fun to be around. They may put upward pressure on rents but they start new businesses aplenty and provide demand for existing businesses ranging from 247 convenience stores to clothes shops.” He added: “University academics and their research are sources of inspiration and intellectual energy. As a result, universities are major sources of direct and indirect employment – they are the anchor institutions of the 21st-century economy, and most city councils are figuring out ways to keep their students once they graduate. Do without them at your peril.”Residents who replied to the National HMO Lobby were more angry about bad landlords and the universities’ attitudes than iniduals’ behaviour. In April, a court in Birmingham ordered an “unscrupulous” landlord (the court’s words) to pay £182,000 in fines and costs for 31 breaches of HMO regulations, many of them relating to fire and safety issues, and failing to apply for licences. Campaigners also said that if students feel ripped off by landlords it was human nature for them to have little regard for the property they live in and, by extension, the wider area.Schools in high-density student HMO areas have closed in St Andrews, Leeds, Durham, Nottingham and Loughborough. Two primary schools in Brighton, in the areas close to the city’s two universities, started the new school year with two-thirds of their Year One places unfilled.The Residential Landlords Association, which represents about 60,000 landlords, believes imposing restrictions on HMOs is too late. Policy manager John Stewart said priority should be given to educating landlords, and teaching prospective students about living away from home. “Students don’t know how to budget, how to cook, how to clean, how to look after a property. They need to be taught about social responsibility,” he said.In 2004 Smith, who is writing a book on studentification, was commissioned by the prime minister’s office to write a guide on the subject. “It spelled out then that it was a national phenomenon,” he said. “It has become more deeply embedded since then. It is an international phenomenon. Students are now seen as discernible consumers. They have capital to spend, albeit debt capital. It’s a different world to when your tuition fees and rent were subsidised by the government, when you lived in grotty digs.”Smith believes universities, slow to react in the 1990s, have tried to appease residents by “putting together community strategies” since the 2000s. “There’s a lot of goodwill around,” he said. “It’s a process of urban change. I’m sure some residents’ groups want more action. But those residents are not going to get their neighbourhoods back that were there before studentification – that’s a thing of the past.”Residents in Fallowfield, Manchester, spoke to the Observer about the student influx but wanted to remain anonymous.One woman said: “We get shouting at all hours. We have to wipe sick off the car windscreen, we have people peeing against the house wall. There was the party where a floor collapsed through to the basement. These are not normal parties – they sometimes have bouncers, guest lists, drug deliveries, DJs. It’s frightening if you live next door to that.“We started to film the parties because the universities wouldn’t believe us. After that, the council and the universities tried to help but what they are doing is not nearly enough. I was a student myself but this is beyond anything I ever could have imagined.“The street noise can be more anxiety-inducing than anything. If you go to bed thinking, ‘Is it going to be a bad night tonight?’ you’re already on edge.”Drugs are also a problem. “At the beginning of the academic year there are new business cards dropped all over the area with someone’s first name, a number and a little sample of cannabis on them so you can call the dealer. My kids have been offered drugs from the age of 14. “Local politicians won’t champion our cause because of the student vote. We’re in the minority. Despite all this, we have a strong community spirit. Why should we move out? We choose to stay and seek a sustainable neighbourhood for the good of all.”Asked about its efforts to combat antisocial behaviour, the University of Manchester said that alongside Manchester politan University it had created a body that works with the police, the council and student unions to monitor and respond to off-campus issues. There is a landlord accreditation scheme, weekly community audits and a neighbourhood planning forum. The universities jointly created the UK Town and Gown Association to strengthen relations between students and residents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c6abb97d67b013b1daf6d2b3908db165a53176/215_675_6323_3792/master/6323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b84b3b59f7bf4b71eb6e6169ebf14c4","title":"hidden assets the fashion labels you need to buy right now","story":"That Australian brand with a flirty line in slips, those chic handbags, the vibrant raincoat… finding the best in undiscovered styleCan a label with more than 400,000 followers on Instagram really be under the radar?

The director and cast describe how a chance meeting led to a Sundance-nominated dramaeveryone, look this way. Everyone. Hellooo…!” The Observer photographer is having difficulty getting the Skate Kitchen crew to concentrate. Casual in front of the dramatic backdrop of a soaring Brooklyn Bridge, the young women straggle and chat, drag their skateboards, scroll on their phones, discuss what they’re going to do after this. “I’m gonna skate across the bridge,” says Nina Moran, 20. “It’s too hot!” says Ardelia “Dede” Lovelace, 20. “It’s my birthday today,” says Rachelle Vinberg (she’s turning 20). “I forgot until my mom called me. What am I doing to celebrate? I want to go for a run.”“Oh, it’s always like herding cats,” says Crystal Moselle. Moselle is the director of the Sundance-breakout Skate Kitchen, a coming-of-age film about an all-female New York skateboarding collective so closely based on the lives of the girls it features that it seems more like documentary than fiction. The lines are very blurred.Moselle was drawn to the group initially because of how they looked. She spotted Moran and Vinberg on the subway and approached them because of Moran’s noisy charisma and because it was so unusual to see young women with skateboards. “I took them for coffee,” she says. “Which they were really excited about, because they’d never been to coffee with an adult before.” Moselle’s first feature, The Wolfpack, which won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance festival in 2015, was a documentary about an extraordinary New York family of boys, the Angulo brothers, kept away from society by their father. In that case, too, Moselle just happened upon them: she saw the brothers walking on the street, and chased after them because they looked so unusual (they were dressed like the characters from Reservoir Dogs). The Wolfpack, as the title implies, was about the family group. Similarly, Skate Kitchen is about a crew: the friendship group of young women that Moselle met through Moran and Vinberg. “There’s something about the ensemble that I really love,” says Moselle. “How an inidual works within that.”Moselle hung out with the girls for a year: Vinberg, Moran, Lovelace and their friends Kabrina Adams and Jules Lorenzo (plus Lorenzo’s sister, Brenn, and Ajani Russell, who aren’t here). They all spent a lot of time at Moselle’s house in Brooklyn – “it was a safe zone” – and she listened to their conversations, interviewed them and eventually got them to rehearse scenes. For each scene, she didn’t tell them what to say, but gave them what she calls “beats” – significant moments – that they had to get to. Most of the incidents were based on real life.In the film, Camille, played by Vinberg, is banned from skateboarding by her mum after she severely injures herself. She “credit cards” herself, which is exactly as leg-crossing as you imagine. (“She hurt her vagina,” deadpans Moran. “Yeah, I’ve done that twice in real life,” says Vinberg.) Lonely and bored in her Long Island home, Camille connects with a Lower East Side female skateboarding crew via Instagram. She’s quickly accepted and, after her mum and her argue irrevocably, moves in with Janay (Lovelace) and her family. Though she is welcomed by the crew, Camille isn’t always at ease. Early in the film, the girls are walking in the street and Kabrina Adams is playing music from a speaker that hangs around her neck (she has it on today). As Junior Senior’s Move Your Feet blasts out, she and Moran start dancing around. Vinberg holds back: she’s more inhibited, not a dancer. This happened in real life, and was the cue for Moselle to develop Camille’s story: “She was timid and that was when I thought: ‘This is the dynamic we need in the movie,’” says Moselle.Camille is an outsider who’s accepted, and can’t believe her luck. But then she messes up. She becomes friendly with a boy skater, Devon – played by actorrappersongwriter Jaden Smith, one of the film’s few experienced actors – and everything goes wrong.Skate Kitchen’s strength is its intimacy. You are right inside its world, whether the women are talking about tampons and toxic shock syndrome, or they’re stoned and messed up at a party, or skating en masse around Manhattan streets. And that world is very true to life.“I’m obsessed with the idea of realism with film,” says Moselle. “I want to make films that feel real in every aspect. Even if it’s a period piece.” Originally, she wanted to do a documentary about the skate crew, but rejected that idea, partly because she was asked to make a short film for Miu Miu’s Women’s Tales series (That One Day – it features Vinberg, Moran and Lovelace and is akin to a Skate Kitchen precursor), but also because “with documentary, you have to stand back and observe. You can’t alter what’s going on. With this, I wanted to immerse myself, be a part of it.”Still, though the film is close to real life, there are differences. Despite the main plot point, all the girls are cool with the male skateboarders who feature in the film – “they’re our friends,” they say – and they already knew Smith, a fellow skateboarder, and whom they suggested for the part. (Moselle got him to move to New York and hang out with everyone for a few months.)But that’s not to deny that girls in skateboarding often get a tough time from their male counterparts, who vastly outnumber them in New York, as elsewhere. Moran has given a TEDx talk about the difficulties this can lead to. How when she started skateboarding, at 12, she was ridiculed by the boys she hoped to skate with. How when she worked in a skateboarding shop, she discovered she was being paid less than her male colleagues (she quit). How a boy she considered a friend told her that girls can never be good at skateboarding.Lorenzo, 20, who started doing tricks only a year ago, who only started doing tricks a year ago, says a lot of guys try to get involved: “They’re like: ‘Oh, do you need help with that?’ And I’m like: ‘Thanks, but I didn’t ask you!’ They just come over because you’re a girl. I already know how to do it, I’m just practising.”Moran: “It’s like when they say: ‘Oh, I didn’t realise you actually skated!’ I’m like: ‘Bro, really? You thought I carried the board like an accessory? Like it’s my purse?’”“It’s micro-aggressions,” says Adams, 25. “Everyone does it and we don’t even think about it, it’s just ingrained in society. Like when a guy talks to you when you’re clearly listening to music.”They all agree that it’s far easier to learn as a female skateboarder if you have other women to skate with. Though they come from different parts of the US, with varied family backgrounds, they all started skateboarding aged about 12, and spent hours on their own, just practising. “Did you ever do that thing where you wouldn’t drink water until you landed a trick?” says Vinberg. “I used to sleep in the skate park sometimes,” says Moran. “It was OK until it rained.”Skateboarding is a strange combination of efficient means-to-get-around and show-off tricks. It attracts outsiders, say the women, artistic types, into clothes and self-expression, sometimes with anger issues (Adams says she gave up doing tricks because when she was young because she used to get so mad: “I threw my board too many times.”). They all prefer the street-cruising aspect, “the freedom”. Some of the most warming scenes in the film show this: the group skating together, taking up space in a city in a way that most young women don’t. “Strength in numbers,” says Moran. “We’re more powerful as a group.”The film has brought the Skate Kitchen-ers to an international audience: they’ve travelled as far as Taipei, where Vinberg spent an afternoon skating around with a stranger, communicating simply by means of her skateboard (she let him share it). Their increased visibility has prompted other women to get in touch, wanting to learn “just simple stuff like what board to get, how to set it up”. Moran organises all-female skate meet-ups through Instagram, announcing a skate park, date and time: any woman that turns up wanting to have a gotry is welcomed.Some members of the group hope to do more acting, if they can fit it in with all their other projects. Lovelace paints, Adams dances and makes her own short films, Vinberg would like to direct. Moran likes acting too. “But really,” she says, “I just want to make an army of skateboarding women. Yeah. That’d be lit!”Skate Kitchen is out on Friday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b73b64cd7814c1019ffeb7626c9818b6cc94eee/0_1968_3324_1994/master/3324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80b2a6e6b5d1d8ab2ffa17b88602d09d","title":"nigel slater ricotta recipes","story":"Spread straight on to bread, baked, used in puds or scoffed in lumps, lovely versatile ricotta is a source of joyI made myself a slice of thick toast, its crumb chewy, its crust as black as soot, then spread the surface with a snowy mound of ricotta and pieces of jelly-fleshed apricot. This treat never quite made it to the table and I ate it while standing at the kitchen counter. Then, a few minutes later, a second piece of bread, this time untoasted with a swirl of the ricotta, its crest pushed down into a hollow deep enough to hold a pool of olive oil. Unmediated, almost spontaneous. Eaten out of pure greed after coming home with a fresh loaf and white cheese as soft as cream.Ricotta barely makes it as a cheese. Traditionally made from the whey left behind after the curds that will become cheese are removed and start their journey to the maturing room, this is the lightest, gentlest-tasting dairy product, next to milk. It has no body to speak of, and can be spread like whipped cream. I like it with strawberries. You can make ricotta al caffe, the famous desert with ricotta and espresso, or use it in a cheesecake to lighten the mixture of eggs, mascarpone or cream cheese.I like it folded into whipped cream as a filling for a sponge cake to be eaten for lunch with raspberries, though it is probably best known as a stuffing, with tiny nibs of candied peel and shards of dark chocolate, in a crisp, cigar-shaped cannoli. If you dust the finished pastry with icing sugar rather than trying to sweeten the ricotta itself, the filling is less likely to weep.For lunch the other day, I brought a dish of baked ricotta to the table, the cheese set into a firm soufflé with eggs and thyme. We piled it on to our plates with roasted tomatoes and spooned over the basil-scented juices. Slicing it like a cake I ate the leftovers the next day, with a dollop of tomato chutney.Salted ricotta, where the fresh curds are drained, salted and pressed, has been the most useful addition to my fridge this summer. The piquant logs of cheese have been crumbled into bowls of raw, roughly chopped peas, or cooked and skinned broad beans, or broken into tiny, gravel-sized nuggets and tossed with basil leaves and olive oil as a dressing for green-shouldered tomatoes. Add a squeeze of lemon and you have a vibrant dressing for the heart of a lettuce or raw shredded cabbage, or you could fold it through chunks of chilled watermelon.It is fair to say it works better as a seasoning than as a principal ingredient and yet many times this summer I found myself breaking off a chalky lump and wolfing it as I might a piece of feta. Another of my little standing-at-the-kitchen-counter pleasures.This is one of those recipes that works both hot and cold, though isn’t at its best served straight from the fridge. Feel free to add a pinch of dried chilli flakes or a little dried mint. I haven’t added salt to the mix but you may wish to, depending on the age of your parmesan. The older, firmer cheeses may well be salty enough.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Transfer the ricotta to a mixing bowl and lightly mash it with a wooden spoon.Break the eggs into a bowl, beat well with a fork, then fold into the ricotta with finely ground black pepper. Roughly chop the thyme leaves then mix with all but 2 tbsp of the parmesan.Fold the thyme and parmesan into the ricotta then spoon into an oven dish. Smooth the surface then scatter the reserved grated cheese over the top.Place the dish in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes until the ricotta has risen and the crust is golden brown. Serve immediately with the tomatoes below.Made with good, ripe tomatoes, fruity olive oil and big, peppery basil leaves, this dish can stand up as a light lunch, served with hunks of sourdough to soak up the juices. You could tuck a few olives among the cherry tomatoes and basil leaves, or a few fillets of anchovy.Slice the large tomatoes in half, then scoop out the cores and seeds. Place cut side up, in a baking dish. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and push into the hollows with the basil leaves, and season with pepper and salt. Fill each tomato almost to the top with olive oil then bake for 35-40 minutes until on the verge of collapse. Serve with the baked ricotta, spooning tomato juices over as you go.Salted ricotta has slowly become one of my go-to ingredients. I appreciate its ability – even a couple of tablespoons grated over warm vegetables – to bring things to life.shelled peas 250gparsley a few sprigstomatoes 150g, smallpea shoots 25gsalted ricotta 4 tbspolive oil for dressingBring a saucepan of water to the boil, salt it lightly then add the peas and cook for 4 or 5 minutes.

Well, regular in one sense but not in another given it is Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota who are sitting in front of a plate of delicious Portuguese custard tarts – pastéis de nata – talking about cricket.For Jota and Neves, who joined Wolves in July last year after playing together at Porto, this little corner of the Black Country feels like home away from home. Hélder Costa, another member of the sizeable Portuguese contingent at the club, is credited with discovering the place, which opened 13 months ago. Monica, who is from Porto, could not have timed things better in that respect, although she has no interest in football and was oblivious to the fact a number of her customers were household names and worth millions of pounds until she saw her boyfriend talking to them and asked how he knew them.Neves and Jota, who got to know each other playing for Portugal’s Under-21s, are terrific company. Humble and affable, they speak with such maturity it is easy to forget they are 21 years old. At times they are like a married couple as they finish off one another’s sentences, no more so than when the conversation turns to the slightly awkward question of how they compare Wolverhampton with Porto.“It’s not possible to compare, it’s completely different,” Neves says, diplomatically. “In Porto it’s a tourist city. It’s close to the river, the ocean as well, there’s a lot of history. The wine and the food also. And here it’s an industrial city. But we’re fine with it. We want to play football … in the best league in the world, so the city doesn’t matter,” Jota adds. “And we have a good home and our family with us,” continues Neves.The overriding impression is that Neves and Jota could not be happier. Jota talks about how much more comfortable he is off the field in Wolverhampton than in Porto, where the level of attention was suffocating at times, and both remark on how refreshing it is to be in a league where the ball is in play a lot more. “Time-wasting is one of the worst things we have in Portugal,” Jota says, sighing. “For example, when we played against Manchester City we still wanted to play when we had Jonny injured. But in Portugal, you’ll get a lot of players ‘injured’.”The follow-up question prompts Neves and Jota to react with laughter and a sense of incredulity. Given that their manager is also Portuguese, does he ever get invited to the birthday dinners? “Nooooooooo!” the two respond in unison, looking flabbergasted. “You can’t cross that line,” Jota says, smiling.Their level of respect for Nuno, who also managed them at Porto, shines through when they talk about him. “He’s a really intense and ambitious coach,” Neves says. “I think the most important thing is the motivation – he’s always motivated to do his best all the time. Even when we’re playing good, he wants us to play better. I think this makes the difference with him.”Everything comes a lot more easily with a ball at their feet. Neves has caught the eye this season with his wonderful range of passing, and it feels a matter of time before Jota, Wolves’ top scorer last season, opens his Premier League account. “We want to make ourselves look good in the best league in the world,” Jota says. “When it was our first game, against Everton, I was very emotional, because it really means something for me. When I came on to the field, I thought: ‘I’m here’.”Saturday’s visit to Old Trafford promises to be another special occasion, especially with José Mourinho in the opposite dugout. Neves, who grew up supporting Porto, can vividly remember their 2004 Champions League triumph under Mourinho, even though he was only seven. “I watched the final with my family,” he says. “We went into Porto to celebrate because all my family are fans. Mourinho is a legend at Porto.”Rather surprisingly neither Neves nor Jota has spoken to Mourinho, despite plenty of common ground, including when it comes to their agent. Jorge Mendes represents all three and it is interesting listening to Jota’s response when asked how important Mendes is from a player perspective.“He’s like my right arm,” Jota says. “I think from a player’s point of view, you feel you are with the best at his job. I feel there is no one better than him to manage my career, so I have nothing to worry about – just to do my job on the field. When you speak with him, he’s really ambitious and he says you can always do more. He’s very confident and believes in you more than you do yourself sometimes.”Monica could probably do with Mendes’s help, too, because sadly Aromas de Portugal is on the market. Monica’s father is ill and the family have asked her to return home, meaning she is trying to find a new owner. All the catering equipment is included in the price and the same goes for a distinguished list of regular customers, provided the place remains in Portuguese hands. “We hope it does,” says Neves. “We have alternatives. But the best place for us is here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90c14adbe49b3540887962224315138f63cd9172/0_156_3779_2268/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efee9a7be635e6b7e5ac318e4a9941f4","title":"arsenal everton premier league match report","story":"Alexandre Lacazette scored a beauty, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made the points safe and Unai Emery could toast a fourth consecutive Premier League win. Yet this was an afternoon when the margins were fine and the result could just as easily have gone the other way if Everton had turned up with their shooting boots on.Petr Cech was the star turn and Emery’s decision to persist with the goalkeeper ahead of the summer signing, Bernd Leno, was more than vindicated. Cech made five stops in the first half that ranked from decent to excellent and, more than anyone, it was the 36-year-old who created the platform for victory. He went on to save brilliantly from Michael Keane at 2-0 and again from the substitute, Cenk Tosun, to ensure a first clean sheet of the Emery era. Everton felt chiefly frustration and not only because Aubameyang’s goal that killed the game ought to have been disallowed for offside. It was not even a borderline call. The Arsenal forward was a full yard in front of Jonjoe Kenny, the last defender.The visitors had been the better team before the break and, on another day and against another goalkeeper, they might have been comfortably in front. The positive aspect for the manager, Marco Silva, was the fluency his players showed and how, initially, they knocked Arsenal from their stride. There was little wrong with his gameplan. The bad news was that it was not the first time Silva’s players had been guilty of profligacy it was a similar story in the home defeat by West Ham last weekend. Everton have taken six points from their opening six fixtures and this was their 21st defeat in 25 visits to Arsenal. They have drawn the other four.It was noticeable to see the Emirates Stadium was pockmarked by empty seats, particularly in the middle and upper tiers, and the atmosphere could best be described as subdued for long spells. Nobody quite knows what to make of this Arsenal team yet they are waiting to judge them.There was the sense of square pegs in round holes, with Aubameyang shoehorned in on the left and Mesut Özil stationed on the right – and struggling to suppress the urge to drift inside. The natural width must come from the full-backs Héctor Bellerín and Nacho Monreal.There were times when Arsenal lacked imagination but it would turn out well enough after Lacazette had turned the contest on its head. The irony was that – wonderful finish aside – the centre-forward was peripheral and Emery admitted afterwards he was about to substitute him when he scored. Alex Iwobi was stripped and ready. Everton were more coherent in the first half, more threatening – particularly through Richarlison – while their pressing panicked an Arsenal defence in which Shkodran Mustafi endured a couple of wobbles and Sokratis Papastathopoulos was forced off with a knee injury.Silva’s team could curse Cech from the second minute, when he made his best save. The Everton captain, Tom Davies, set Dominic Calvert-Lewin clean through but, one-on-one with Cech, the striker could not trick past him. Richarlison – back in the team after suspension – was in the mood. He took a lovely touch, rolled away from Bellerín and extended Cech while he would be denied again by the goalkeeper on 44 minutes. Everton could point to the Lucas Digne free-kick that Cech tipped over and the Gylfi Sigurdsson pass that released Theo Walcott in on goal. Cech was off his line to block.Arsenal’s only clear first-half chance came in the 12th minute when Aubameyang touched back Bellerín’s lovely cross for Monreal. His connection was not the cleanest but it still required a good stop from Jordan Pickford. Arsenal worked Lacazette into an inviting position on 41 minutes only for him to take a heavy touch while Aubameyang’s overhit cross kissed the top of the crossbar.Emery gave Lucas Torreira a first Premier League start and the defensive midfielder had some nice moments, although he got himself booked early on when he jumped into a tackle on Sigurdsson.Silva felt his team started the second half brightly but they would be floored by a one-two punch. There was amazement when Aubameyang’s goal was allowed to stand – he converted from Aaron Ramsey’s flick, which the midfielder executed with his trailing leg after a little stumble. Arsenal had snapped forward through Özil after a mistake by Kurt Zouma.Lacazette’s opener was marked by the highest class. Arsenal were chuntering over a non-penalty award, after Aubameyang had headed against Kenny’s hand at close quarters, but the moans were overtaken by smiles when Lacazette collected Ramsey’s pass, took a touch to set himself and picked out the far, top corner with his right foot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The most popular baby names of 2017 have been announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and while Olivia, Oliver and Muhammad – in its varied spellings – remain the most likely names to be heard shouted across the nation’s playgrounds in years to come, the inventiveness of parents shows no sign of slowing down.Aurora, Lyla, Orla, Edith and Hallie enter the top 100 girls’ names, while for boys, popular names include Leo, which enters the top 10, and Ralph, moving into the top 100.Sarah, the most popular name for girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since records began in 1904.Parents in England and Wales gave 28,222 different names to the 348,071 boys born last year, and 35,475 to the 331,035 girls. More parents seem to be aiming for something celestial, with Luna and Aria among the fastest-rising girls’ names in the past decade.The biggest climber was Harper, the name David and Victoria Beckham gave to their youngest child in 2011. Music and sport often provide inspiration, with 35 parents plumping for Kendrick for boys – perhaps with the rapper Kendrick Lamar in mind – and 50 calling their boys Kobe, possibly after the basketball player Kobe Bryant.However, the British political class does not inspire people so much. There is no Boris, Jeremy or Theresa in either of the top 100s, although Jacob was the sixth-most popular name in 2017, a year in which the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has grown in popularity in some quarters. There were only 11 Nigels born last year, compared with 50 Winstons.The names given to the newborns of England and Wales present a different and more erse picture than those registered when Britain joined the EU in 1973. Back then, Michael and Jennifer were the most popular names.There is also considerable regional variation. In Gwynedd, north Wales, Hari is the most popular name given to boys. In Blackburn, it is Zainab for girls. Amelia and Muhammad are most popular in Birmingham, Jack and Olivia in Bristol, and Arthur, Oscar, Florence and Lily in Tunbridge Wells.Muhammad was the 10th most popular name for boys, but if the alternative spellings of Mohammed or Mohammad were included, it would be about as popular as Oliver and its variants, such as Olly, across England and Wales, the ONS said.Two names that do not appear in the top 100s are Walt and Boo, the twins born this week to Chris Evans and Natasha Shishmanian, who had earlier nicknamed the boy and girl Ping and Pong, which do not appear either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29dd8682126b170603573c7416785e3eb2c691a3/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2064556b5421b2ea9066718565277cc6","title":"comcast 30bn bid for sky what does it mean","story":"What sort of business is Comcast, what will happen to Sky News and will Sky customers be affected?Traditional media companies are increasingly concerned about the threat from tech and streaming video companies such as Netflix. Sky is a very profitable business, with 23m customers across Europe and produces its own content. Opportunities to buy such a business are increasingly rare, helping to drive up the price to an extraordinary £30bn. There is also an element of revenge: Comcast lost out to Disney in the battle for the entertainment assets of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox but has now outbid its rival, albeit at a high price.Comcast is little known in the UK but is a major force in the US, where it owns a large cable TV and internet business. It creates its own content through NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC TV network and Universal Studios. However, the company has faced regulatory issues and was named “worst company in America” twice in recent years due to customer service issues.At the moment, absolutely nothing, as the deal will only be approved by Sky shareholders in October. Some analysts suggest subscription prices could rise to pay for the bid, but this could risk driving away customers. Sky is in good financial shape, paying less for football rights than it has in the past, and there is potential for other content to be shared across the wider Comcast group.Sky News has been the subject of much discussion during the bidding – not least because politicians and journalists watch it and are often invited to appear on it. A complicated deal was proposed by the government earlier this year in the event that Fox – and inevitably Disney – won but this is no longer required. But there are questions about how the Sky purchase fits with Comcast-owned NBC’s investment in Euronews, the pan-European news broadcaster that is being relaunched and is set to come under the NBC banner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3a3577c4b71cd9f7401c0ed091afebc513e1010/0_189_4585_2750/master/4585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a0f21f112e523c09f00b855b47efad3","title":"comcast sky rupert murdoch worldwide news","story":"Mogul’s influence on worldwide news is unlikely to be weakened by latest defeatRupert Murdoch’s dream of taking full control of Sky dissolved on Saturday night as he was outbid by the US firm Comcast. But anyone celebrating a setback for the mogul should be warned. The most isive figure in Britain’s media may still have the last laugh.Murdoch’s abrasive and headline-grabbing era in charge of Sky came to an end in a high-stakes auction. There was no head-to-head face-off across a boardroom table: it was a simple email that sealed the future of Sky after a bruising battle between Fox and Comcast. Shortly after 7pm the City of London Takeover Panel issued a short statement: Comcast had tabled a knockout £30bn bid, which was swiftly recommended to shareholders by Sky’s independent directors. Attention is now focused on what one of the most successful and criticised men in media business history will do next. In common with the battling media family on the Sky Atlantic TV show Succession, there are questions about where Murdoch will focus his business efforts, whether he can continue to maintain his current level of political influence, and when anyone – in or outside his family – will take over from the 87-year-old.Murdoch’s influence over the worldwide news business is unlikely to be weakened by the Sky defeat. He will continue to control News Corp, the newspaper and publishing business he split from his TV and film interests at the peak of the phone-hacking scandal. He will also retain control of the cable channel Fox News, where he has been a regular feature in the office, leaving him in charge of a global news business that also includes the Wall Street Journal, the Times and the Sun in the UK, and the publishing business HarperCollins.In addition to maintaining good relations with Donald Trump, his ability to influence politics in his native Australia remains solid he was recently blamed for the departure of the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Murdoch shows no sign of retiring. He suffered a bad fall on his son’s yacht at the end of last year, forcing him to rehabilitate at home and prompting speculation about the state of his health. But he has since recovered, to be featured in paparazzi pictures on the beach with his wife, Jerry Hall.In addition, his financial position is improved by cashing in on the enormous demand for media businesses as the industry goes through a round of consolidation that is driving up prices. He will also become a substantial shareholder in Disney, albeit with less control than he used to enjoy at Fox.The Comcast deal is likely to have a bigger impact on the Murdoch dynasty. James Murdoch, currently chief executive of 21st Century Fox and chairman of Sky, is set to leave the family business as a result of the Disney deal, despite at one point being tipped for a top job at the combined business.His older brother, Lachlan, is now is a better position to take over what remains of the Murdoch conglomerate, having returned to the fold in 2014 and currently serving alongside his father as executive co-chairman of News Corp.The Sky takeover still requires shareholder approval, but there will be rejoicing among senior Sky executives, set for a payday worth hundreds of millions of pounds thanks to a performance-related bonus scheme. Nearly half of all Sky employees – including some at Sky News – are on an employee share scheme, which could see them receive healthy payouts from the takeover.Alice Enders, of Enders Analysis, a media research service, said Murdoch had no real influence on this deal. She said: “The Murdochs have been out the picture since the Fox merger agreement with Disney was signed. They sold out to Disney. They didn’t make any decision in this auction.”Despite this, she said, the high price bid by Comcast was “a ringing endorsement of a company that Mr Murdoch built from square one”. “They don’t have any cash,” she said of the family. “The whole idea of Rupert is not to have a huge amount of cash around and to tie it up in a lovely company called Disney. They then have this big stake in Disney and it’s a company they trust. The whole destiny of the Murdoch empire is already wrapped with Disney, then with New Fox, and then with News Corp.”Disney, which is also preparing to launch its own streaming service to rival Netflix, could equally cash in on the Sky shareholding, which is now worth about £12bn after Comcast bid more than necessary to win the auction.The Comcast deal has been a bonanza for some hedge funds, as Sky shares more than doubled over the year. One firm sitting on an enormous profit is Odey Asset Management, run by Crispin Odey, who helped to bankroll the Brexit campaign. In another sign of the complex web of connections that tie the British political, media and business worlds together, Odey was once married to Murdoch’s daughter Prudence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d86350ce692587344681717fc38a5c1f30aba3b/0_72_6219_3731/master/6219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfdfb8f1eaaae84ce1de6e2bd9f8db64","title":"new york review of books editor free speech","story":"Economic pressures and social media are forcing the media to think twice about upsetting readersBy the time the 130,000 regular readers of the New York Review of Books picked up their new copy of the literary journal last week, the cover story had already cost the editor Ian Buruma his job. In a spectacularly ill-judged essay, the Canadian former radio presenter Jian Ghomeshi provided a lengthy reflection on all the bad things that had happened to him as a result of allegations arising out of his behaviour towards women.Incredulous and angry that the NYRB would provide a platform for public rehabilitation of an alleged sexual abuser, journalists and subscribers expressed anger and dismay at the publication. Seemingly unable to stop digging, Buruma responded to the criticism through an interview with Slate’s Isaac Chotiner in which he demonstrated an embarrassingly shaky grasp of the background to Ghomeshi’s story. The quote that ricocheted around the web showed a cringeworthy lack of awareness about how the story was perceived “The exact nature of his behaviour – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern,” said Buruma. And with that, he was gone.Journalists are meant to be experts in context, in joining the dots between facts and circumstance and synthesising them into, if not teachable moments, then certainly saleable narratives and thoughtful analysis.It is very difficult to imagine what would have made publishing a “Fall of Men” edition of the NYRB at this particular moment more acceptable. Maybe if John Hockenberry, another radio presenter who lost his job over allegations of sexual harassment, had not been featured in an identikit essay in Harper’s that week maybe if the NYRB essay had been fact-checked or just better written maybe if the women involved with Ghomeshi had been consulted, or the internet had never been invented, then Buruma would still be in post. His own analysis of the situation was that he had been “convicted on Twitter”. He told the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland: “As editor of the New York Review of Books, I published a theme issue about #MeToo-offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media. And now I, myself, am publicly pilloried.”Making heinous mistakes of fact or opinion is not an option for editors in a subscriber-driven world. Upsetting readers and sponsors in economically perilous times weighs more heavily on editorial decisions, or the reversal of same.After the New Yorker Festival puzzlingly decided to depart from its usual warm bath of celebrity-infused whimsy to book the dyspeptic extremist Steve Bannon as a headliner this year, the editor David Remnick then changed his mind and disinvited Bannon.Public shaming for what are perceived as poor decisions can have serious financial consequences for a newsroom. At the New York Times, the editorial pages have become an unlikely focus for regular reader outrage. When it ran the infamous anonymous op-ed from the White House a couple of weeks ago, it smartly offered readers the chance to ask questions about the piece and its decision to run it. A surprisingly high 23,000 questions were logged.The political environment in America, and the bullhorn of social media amplification, is changing how people think about freedom of expression. Free from the type of laws which patrol speech elsewhere, America has, in the past, relied on the strong social norms and the first amendment to keep order in the public sphere. Now, both journalism organisations and platform companies are feeling the pressure to exercise the right not to publish or amplify certain types of content.Social media and platform companies in particular say they are experiencing much more pressure to remove, restrict and take down certain types of content than to uphold free speech. The recent furore over the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose Infowars channels propagated ridiculous theories but also caused harassment and harm, demonstrated that even the largest companies who host the public sphere are not immune to public pressure or, indeed, rational editorial decision-making.How decisions are made about what reaches the public and what is suppressed is becoming a critical part of a wider political struggle between what many see as an over-amplified far right and what the right would describe as a liberal elite. Stories emerged last week that Google search engineers discussed how they might counter search results with offensively racist terms in them after Donald Trump issued a travel ban in January 2017. With midterm elections approaching in the US, the way news and information, and even opinion, circulates could not be more closely watched or hotly contested.In a report from the thinktank Data and Society last week, the researcher Rebecca Lewis collected information from a number of channels on YouTube to describe what she called an “alternative influence network”, comprising what she categorised as libertarian and right-leaning vloggers and YouTubers who employed the same marketing and search engine optimisation tactics as commercial influencers.Many of those linked in the report quickly rejected the findings or suggested the political categorisations were off base. However, the report’s identification of new types of network that operate outside the norms of mainstream media is undeniably true. Lewis highlighted the promotion and optimisation practices of such networks and suggested that the platform was designed to help exactly this type of activity, even if it did not initially imagine it would be supporting such content.Lewis’s conclusion included the idea that platforms such as YouTube should “govern content and behaviour for explicit values, such as the rejection of content that promotes white supremacy, regardless of whether it includes slurs”.The operation of YouTube channels promoting rightwing agendas might sit at the opposite end of the spectrum to the NYRB when it comes to editorial decision-making. However, the pressure from a networked public sphere is going to continue to reshape both, perhaps at a pace and in a direction for which neither are quite prepared."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fedac3d45c16ac206d3641173b87b787a17709/0_446_6264_3758/master/6264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5db7322567f8d0f7982b4e44f5a69e3b","title":"cat power i didnt know i loved myself when i was younger ","story":"Erratic stage shows, psychotic breakdowns, rehab… Cat Power’s chaotic life is in direct contrast to her soulful music. Now a new album and motherhood have given her a profound sense of calmCat Power, whose real name is Chan Marshall, meets me in the lobby of her London hotel, and things do not go as expected. First, she is warm and inviting, when her smoky, melancholy records had led me to expect someone much more remote. And second, she is immediately in full swing with her impersonation of my English accent. “Life in the old dog yet, eh!” she says, after we decide to go to her room to avoid the noise and the smoking rules. “Good old Blighty!” she adds, as we get into the lift. I didn’t see this coming – not from a woman who grew up in the Deep South of the US, where she learned to sing about drunks and devils and depravity while dodging them, and has been dodging them ever since. I didn’t know she’d be funny.“Aaaaand relax,” the 46-year-old says, sitting down on the rooftop balcony of her hotel room, after opening a bottle of red wine from the minibar and lighting cigarettes for us that she keeps in a leather pouch she bought in Mexico. As we talk, she tops up my glass but not her own, “I can get you drunk, but not me,” she says, because she has to go on stage tonight. If you’re a fan of Cat Power’s music, you might be thinking: “Well, hang on a minute, she was drunk the last time I saw her live, in fact she turned her back on the audience, muttered something inaudible, stopped in the middle of three songs and then walked off.” Such erraticism is indeed something her live shows became known for in her own life there were psychotic breakdowns, and she went to rehab for alcohol and prescription-drug addiction. Her diehard fans never wavered, though. For them, to know Cat Power’s heartbreaking, raw music is to love her unconditionally, giving her a rightfully elevated position in the American alt-rock scene, alongside contemporaries such as Sonic Youth and Will Oldham. Her blues singing and otherworldly coolness have also been noted by the fashion industry, with Karl Lagerfeld asking her to model Chanel jewellery after seeing her smoking a cigarette outside the Mercer Hotel in New York.Currently, she is on a wave of rebirth, having changed record label, surprised her fans by becoming a mother, and realised her mind was never what others thought it was. Her new album is called Wanderer, she produced it herself, and it has already attracted excitement with its first single, Woman, a duet recorded with Lana Del Rey. One music website explained that the astonishment at their pairing was because Del Rey gets called out for being too fake, while Marshall gets questioned for being too real. But we’re not here to focus on the things that women are criticised for – this is Cat Power’s female solidarity album. She even has a Rihanna cover version on it, which came about after she heard it in a car – and hated it.She explains: a few years ago she was collected from an airport by the man who was then her lover, and the song Stay, a ballad, came on the radio. He said fondly: “There’s my girl,” as she got into the car, and her spirits soared – until she realised he was talking about Rihanna. “I turned off the radio. It was just terrible. So I’ll never forget that song, right?” Yet, years later, she was in a car, again, and heard it from start to finish, “and I then realised why Rihanna is so loved – because of her piercing direction, her vibrating, easy vocal, her delivery. I was on my way to the dentist or somewhere and, fuck, I was bawling in a taxi.”One night she went to a karaoke bar – something she adores, private booths only – “and I found the song, Stay, and I sang it and sang it – then I said to my friend, ‘Do you mind if I sing it again?’ He didn’t care, he just wanted to get drunk and eat food. So I sang it 16 times.” When she started recording her album, she found herself singing it again. Her finished version starts with the chorus and then proceeds to disassemble its tight four-four rhythm into something else entirely. This album contains a lot of layered vocals, where she records herself singing the same line again and again, creating her own echo. I ask her how she knows when a song is finished, but she says it’s quite clear to her.“Like when you’re cooking at your house, you know when you’re done. The purpose is served.”Marshall grew up in a chaotic, poor family with a largely absent blues musician father and a mother from whom she would later become estranged. She has written about alcoholism, violence and assault and, on one song – Black – she sings of running all the way upstairs, to escape someone who “threw me in the bath with an ice and a slap  can of Coke down my throat  on his whole hands and knees”.In her late teens, Marshall got involved in the rock band scene in 1990s Atlanta, a community that she says was full of loss, with people dying of Aids or heroin overdoses before their talent had seen the light of day. (Marshall’s grandmother later told her she was so proud of her not becoming a drug addict or a prostitute.) She had sung in church but had no formal music education, and at about 19 she taught herself the guitar, “just making rhythms, but my best friend Shaun, who passed away, showed me where to put my finger on one chord. That minor sound – sad – is the representation of most of my songs.” On the piano, meanwhile, her trick was to miss out the white keys. “But then I had a lover in South Africa who played saxophone and piano in his jazz club, and one night after the show he showed me exactly where to put my fingers to make a triad.” In her 20s she moved to New York and found a studio where she could record albums Wanderer is her 10th.Talking to Chan Marshall, it is always clear to me what she means. Yet when I come to transcribe the tape recording, it is hard to write up some of the sentences that stop and start, the missing words. You’ll have to imagine the repetitive clicking that takes over her tongue, deep in rhythm, when she says that her grandmother was a farmer, or the swooping gesture her arm makes when describing a sacred musical space, or the direction in which she turns herself, eyes shut, when her mind is looking for a thought that has escaped her. You don’t make records like hers by inhabiting your body like everybody else does.Take the song In Your Face, with its slowed-down Cuban ballroom syncopation and lyrics about a man who protects his conscience with a military fanfare and by forbidding himself to think. Might this, paradoxically, be the first truly beautiful song about Donald Trump?She smiles and explains the title. “In Buddhism, your karma sits on your face. So, there may never be a justification publicly for that bastard – but perhaps one morning he’ll look in the mirror and realise he’s condemned.” She lets out a heartfelt “uuuuggh”, before saying these people come from cultures of hierarchy so there’s never just one of them maintaining the oppression. “It’s a pattern of power. But I think industrialised countries, the people, are becoming more infuriated. Rather than expecting a superhero, you know, a Churchill or a JFK to swoop in, I think people are actually becoming more and more open to paying attention to opposing positions.”So you have some hope? “Well, you have to have hope if you don’t then hopelessness leads to destruction. Or self-destruction. Implosion. Sorry. Sorry!”Marshall ends so many of her thoughts with “Sorry, sorry!” that finally I ask her to promise to stop apologising for herself. “You don’t know how many times I have promised that,” she whispers, with a bittersweet twinkle in her eye, just about managing not to say sorry again. But it is clear that creating peace of mind for herself is something she takes more seriously now. Her old record label, Matador, wanted her last album, Sun, “to be a hit record, and the pressure was overwhelming”. So she moved to Domino, where she felt she could have “some kind of sacred, secret space with this record. I didn’t want to think about what anybody else wanted. I only wanted to think about what arrived in my brain.”Something else that reinforced her, this year, was playing the 20th-anniversary concert of her album Moon Pix in the Sydney Opera House in May. It’s an album that she wrote, inspired by a nightmare when living alone in a farmhouse, and recorded in Australia in 1998, which was then described by Rolling Stone as her “breakthrough record”. The concert cemented something in her head about her own sanity her own power. Marshall met so many fans who wanted to tell her what certain songs helped them through: a brother’s suicide, madness, loss. The more stories she heard, the more she realised what her small act of creation had achieved. Plus, she found a power in the songs themselves that didn’t fit with her memory of the girl who had written them decades earlier. “I didn’t know I loved myself then, when I was younger. But when we played them, I realised the great love that I had had for myself. Those songs had been me trying to prove to myself, you know, it’s OK, you’re all right – but now I know that she did know that, she did know she was worth love.”During that show, Marshall also said to the audience: “I don’t know how many of you here were back with me when I was mad.” I ask her about that now.“You know, I felt like if I was… fucking wacko, then all these motherfuckers were wacko, too. And that’s the whole point, that we weren’t wacko. I definitely wasn’t crazy. And that’s one of the most calming things, the older that I’ve gotten – when I was younger, I wasn’t always able to find inner solidarity, but as I got older it was liberating. It doesn’t even matter if you’re an artist or not: the easiest way out of listening to the truth from a woman speaking it, is to tell her that she’s fucking crazy.”It’s like Sinéad O’Connor, who wanted to tell the world that Catholic priests were sexually abusing children. People wrote her off – but she was right.Three years ago Marshall had a son with a man she doesn’t name, whom she dated for months rather than years. (He is involved, and recently took their son for 10 days on his own, which she admits she found “nerve-wracking”.)“When I was pregnant there was a lot of fear… would I survive birth? When I was born my mom left me at the hospital. She wasn’t well. I think I was very afraid of feeling disconnection from the baby. So any time I’d have that fear I would think back to my great grandma who was a sharecropper, I’d think about what she had to maintain with dignity. Just unapologetic, incredible hard work that still exists on the planet today. And that’s what gave me strength. But it’s not wisdom that grips you when you become a mom – it’s awareness, a new awareness that suddenly just grips your life. It’s a new kind of fear.”As a fellow single mother of a sole child, I ask if she feels a pang when she sees nuclear families with two parents and a couple of kids. She says not as a mother, no, but as a kid she did. They moved house so frequently that she became curious about how other people’s families worked. “I was always the new kid, so I would go into new neighbourhoods to make a friend and I could see how nice it was, their lives: ‘Oh you guys make pancakes?’ And that’s how I live now, because I learned by watching all these humans. I ask my son what he wants for breakfast and I cook it for him. There’s so much happiness in the morning with us.”Might you fall in love again?“I’ll always be a romantic, I think most human beings have that part of their personality. But…” She groans, she smiles, she shuts her eyes. “It would be amazing to fall in love. That’s what everyone’s waiting for,” she says, finally. And she does not apologise.Cat Power’s new album Wanderer is released on 5 October on Domino RecordsFashion editor Jo Jones make-up by Jo Frost at CLM using Dior Backstage Collection and Capture Youth Skincare hair by Paul Donovan at CLM Hair using VO5 photographer’s assistant Sam Reeves fashion assistant Penny Chan This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

At the same time, efforts are under way to eliminate tampon tax and taboos around menstruationFrom the time we’re old enough to get our periods, girls can be made to feel ashamed of them. Everyone who sat in a classroom through those strange, secretive years will remember the absolute horror and dread of being caught short or having to ask a teacher for menstrual products. We learn not only to come prepared but to be silent about what’s going on too. It’s second nature for us to conceal the very fact that we have periods at all – hiding tampons and pads on the way to the bathroom, stuffed into pencil cases, bras, sleeves.If it was difficult for those of us fortunate enough to always have these products to hand, it’s shocking to consider the girls among us who are forced by poverty to go without them entirely. Several years ago the concept of period poverty began to rise in public consciousness in the UK. The Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake, a harrowing account of the realities of poverty in modern Britain, sent awareness of this particular struggle soaring. After its release, food bank managers around England reported that a scene in which a young woman named Katie is forced to shoplift pads sent toiletry donations skyrocketing.Of course, the problem isn’t confined to menstruation when an inidual or a family is living in poverty, it can mean they are forced to choose between eating enough or keeping the lights on and buying all sorts of hygiene essentials. A report by In Kind Direct – an organisation that receives donations from consumer goods companies and distributes them to charities – lists toothpaste, nappies, tampons, razors, deodorant and shampoo as items that had to be foregone by people living in poverty. It is vital that all of these essentials make their way to donation banks. But perhaps one reason that period poverty has especially caught public attention in the past two years is the particular problem of teenage girls, already at economic and social disadvantage, missing out on their education needlessly.Amika George, the teenage campaigner who started the #FreePeriods campaign, became engaged with the issue when she read an article about schoolgirls in Leeds who had been truant on the days of their periods. Concerned teachers had contacted Freedom4Girls, a charity established to provide sanitary products to Kenyan girls and women. Shocked that in modern Britain there were girls forced to choose between missing school and using unsafe alternatives such as socks, toilet paper and rags, George set to work.“I started a petition to call on the government to provide free menstrual products to girls from low-income families, and decided to spread the word and talk unashamedly, not just about period poverty but about menstruation!” she said in an interview with Vogue last year. More shocking to George, and many others, than the problem itself was the fact that nothing was being done about it by the government. Indeed, the fact that sanitary products are taxed as a luxury product means their prices are kept even higher than necessary, blocking more girls from accessing them.At the same time, girlguiding became much more menstruation-positive, with the introduction of a period poverty badge. Guides will be encouraged to discuss this as a social issue, support fundraising for donations, and explore how they feel personally about periods. An activity-led programme of education includes items such as role play of a scenario in which you’ve had a period leak while not at home. Doireann Larkin, the development manager of Tender, a charity that uses drama and the arts to help young people understand healthy relationships, fully supports the initiative: “We need to provide every opportunity for girls to feel confident and secure in school. By failing to address period poverty, we’re denying some girls the chance to focus and participate fully in class and increasing the disadvantage they might already be facing.”Guides will be able to get badges that are decorated with pictures of tampons, pads and menstrual cups, a fact that seems especially encouraging given how previous generations have been taught to hide such images. It’s a strange fact that, until recently, advertising for menstruation products would rarely show the actual product, using isolated fabric samples instead.The Homeless Period Project (HPP) addresses those already at their most vulnerable. While we may understand how desperate a homeless woman’s situation is, we rarely consider the logistical nightmare of menstruating without shelter and access to products. Local chapters of HPP set up their own fundraisers to donate to local shelters.These frontline activists and organisations are crucial. But so too is dismantling the taboo that exists behind all the secrecy and shame. We have to move on from the medieval idea that periods are dirty or not to be spoken of. That’s why young campaigners such as Grace F Victory are so important – she recently collaborated with the Always #EndPeriodPoverty campaign, which has seen the brand donate more than 5m pads directly to schools, a figure that’s estimated to rise to more than 10m donations by the end of the year. After her Instagram post of herself with a menstrual leak lost her hundreds of followers, she spoke out against them. Embarrassment is bad enough in and of itself, but when an inevitable bit of our biology causes us to miss out on daily life, there’s even more need to overcome it. We simply can’t accept that vulnerable young women are being blocked from their education.This is why ending period poverty needs to include taboo busting at its core. We can’t offer help to people too ashamed to ask for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ef739b6774f195bdc7c95af7a56bebba7762c9/7_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df7227ce8218f8f51f310de83d6377b","title":"european press no more forgiving than british over salzburg summit theresa may","story":"If she was hoping for a small crumb of comfort after what the vast majority of the British media saw as a “humiliating” and “disastrous” Salzburg summit, Theresa May did not find it in the pages of the European press.Coverage of the meeting, at which May was bluntly informed that the core components of her Chequers plan “will not work”, was generally focused as much, if not more, on the EU’s disagreements over migration policy as it was on Brexit.But the conclusion of the continental media, few of which made events in Salzburg their top story, was that the prime minister’s predicament was wholly predictable – the EU’s view of Chequers has been known since it was published, many pointed out – and entirely her problem. Commentators were downright scathing.Sheila Sitalsing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said May had “stormed the European continent like a Don Quixote”, Chequers plan and Brexit conditions under her arm: Britain wanted to “keep playing footie and snacking at the canteen, without paying any subs, wearing the club strip or doing bar duty”.The EU27 had “sent her packing in Salzburg”, Sitalsing said, where May had “desperately sought to win sympathy for a Brexit that would not send her population straight back to the Middle Ages”.Her threat that if she was replaced things might get worse “did not impress” EU leaders – but May still seems to believe their hard line “is just a negotiating tactic”. She has got it all wrong: “Poor Theresa May. Poor United Kingdom.”In the Spanish paper El Pais, Álvaro Imbernon Sainz said that since May took office in July 2016, her entire negotiating strategy had been “to postpone decision-making as much as possible, without putting together any kind of clear vision” – but the chickens were now coming home to roost.“The problem is that the differences between the two sides are not technical, but on fundamental principles, and time is beginning to run out,” he said. “Like a bad student who puts off the moment to sit down and study, it’s now up to the UK to make up for lost time.”Britain must “rediscover British pragmatism. For this, the Conservatives, and to a lesser extent Labour, must agree on a coherent and realistic position. Otherwise the historians of the future will be extremely hard on the current British political class”.In France, Le Figaro said May had been “caught in the trap of her ‘it’s me or chaos’” strategy. The prime minister’s Brexit plan was “dead and buried”, the paper said, after she “put her allies up against the wall” by insisting a no deal was the only alternative. “Unfortunately, her plan has met unanimous opposition.”For Le Monde, the EU27 had made plain that “the moment of truth” had come. The bloc’s leaders were “clearly singing from the same hymn sheet” and used the summit to sound the alarm, the paper said: “Brexit talks are in the closing straight – and the EU27 have, for the moment, no intention whatever of softening their stance.”The meeting was above all aimed at “putting maximum pressure on the British prime minister a few days ahead of her party’s annual conference”, it said, adding that the October final deadline set by Donald Tusk, the European council president, for progress on the Irish border was clearly significant.The paper quoted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying he had “perfectly summed up” the Europeans’ position on Brexit: Chequers “is not acceptable because it does not respect the integrity of the single market … Leaving the EU cannot be done without costs or consequences.”Tusk “flatly rejected Britain’s plan for future EU-UK trade relations”, wrote Germany’s Die Welt, adding that the EU27 had “categorically thrown out” May’s Chequers plan quite simply “because it fears it would lead to unfair competition from British firms”. Brexit talks, the paper said, “are deadlocked”.The Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung took the same line, quoting Tusk as saying “May’s Brexit plan will not work” and that negotiations were now at a standstill after “both sides camped firmly on their positions and no agreement was reached”.The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the EU 27 had “approached the British prime minister positively, but given little away”. Britain had “high hopes” of the summit, it said, but “the harvest was meagre”.The EU was walking a tightrope, the paper said: it had to be reasonably positive towards May while not budging, because: “British political drama is the greatest uncertainty around Brexit, and the horror scenario is that whatever is agreed with May proves worthless if she is replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7b1c630b893a1f544ffd0daaa54ee4ddd4b9b4/0_77_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=044473389bc76ff0448bb7c26968136b","title":"theresa may demands respect from eu in brexit negotiations","story":"PM gives combative speech after rejection of Chequers plan, stoking ‘no deal’ fearsTheresa May has accused the European Union of not treating the UK with respect in a deliberately combative address that prompted a sharp fall in the pound amid fears that it made a no deal Brexit more likely.Twenty-four hours after her Salzburg humiliation, the prime minister gave a hastily arranged televised Downing Street statement in an effort to reassert herself.Speaking from a lectern with two union flags behind her, May tried to accuse her counterparts of bad faith: “I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.”Her remarks came a day after the Salzburg summit where EU leaders frustrated by May’s insistence on sticking rigidly to her controversial Chequers negotiating plan embarrassed her when the EU council president, Donald Tusk, unexpectedly declared it “would not work”.May retaliated on Friday: “Yesterday, Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.” She called on the EU to spell out “what their alternative is”.But Tusk, the European council president, hit back hard at the prime minister, accusing her of bringing a “surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising” attitude to the Salzburg summit. He denied May’s claims that the EU had failed to explain its position to the British negotiators, claiming to have spelled out the problems in detail in recent weeks, although he insisted that “a compromise, good for all, is still possible”.Despite the heated rhetoric and plunge in sterling, EU officials are understood to be working on a counter-proposal to the Chequers plan, which is likely to appear in early October, after the Conservative party conference and a week before a make or break Brexit summit in Brussels.No 10 is calculating May can win support by appearing to stand up to the EU, although her critics in the party believe this would be the moment to give up the Chequers plan, or risk facing hostile activists at the party’s annual conference in just over a week.Several cabinet ministers put out statements of support. Penny Mourdant, the international development secretary, again emphasised the possibility of a no deal, saying that while voters “still want a deal” they would be “content to go without one, even folk who voted remain”.But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said that Salzburg was a failure and repeated that it was time to abandon Chequers. “There is still no reason to suppose that Chequers can work either for the UK or the EU.”Chequers proposes that the UK shares a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit in an attempt to prevent a return of customs checks for goods crossing the Irish border, a plan so unpopular on the right of the Tory party that Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned rather than support it.That would imply the UK would have to align itself more broadly to EU rules after Brexit to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland, a proposal that could be difficult for May to sell to her party.Hard Brexiters will step up their campaign against Chequers in the run up to the Tory party conference on Monday. D Davis and other senior rightwing politicians are expected to attend an event at which alternative “Canada plus” trade proposals will be announced.The EU, however, has said that while it would be prepared to discuss a Canada-style deal, that would mean not just taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, it would also mean the return of border controls in Ireland.The prime minister also signalled that the UK would unilaterally safeguard the rights of the EU citizens living in the country in an attempt to reassure them that the impasse in negotiations would not affect their status.“There are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay,” May said.Ministers are expected to confirm details in a couple of weeks, after the party conference season.The prime minister repeatedly rejected an EU backstop proposal that would see Northern Ireland remain inside the customs union if the UK was unable to agree a free trade agreement with Brussels in the orce talks.Ratcheting up the language on the issue, May said: “It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgment it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”In a rare direct criticism of a serving prime minister, Tusk made reference to the criticisms of Michel Barnier by the British government, and the refusal of the British side to work on a solution to the Irish border issue by October, as previously promised.“The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising”, he said. “The response of the EU27 leaders was to reiterate our trust in chief negotiator Michel Barnier and to reiterate our position on the integrity of the single market and the Irish backstop.But he added: “While understanding the logic of the negotiations, I remain convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible. I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised both the prime minister and the EU: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786006ca7cca2054f2fb2293012dd156823f5389/0_102_4577_2747/master/4577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0e1644b8e629f37fd07e7162952063b","title":"brexit corbyn under pressure from all sides over peoples vote","story":"Grassroots groups are pushing the Labour leader to back a second referendum at the party’s conferenceSenior allies of Jeremy Corbyn questioned the rationale for a fresh Brexit referendum on Sunday, as grassroots Labour campaigners ramped up the pressure on the party to shift its position towards a “people’s vote”.Corbyn raised hopes for a new referendum when he told the Sunday Mirror he would support the idea if members vote for it when Brexit is debated at Labour’s conference in Liverpool on Tuesday.“I was elected to empower the members of the party. So if conference makes a decision, I will not walk away from it and I will act accordingly,” he said.However, as more than 100 delegates gathered for a “compositing” meeting on Sunday evening to thrash out a Brexit motion that will be voted on by conference, a string of his senior supporters underlined their concerns about a “people’s vote”.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, whose Salford constituency voted leave, told the  she was concerned the Tories would be able to dictate the question.In the run-up to the Labour conference, local parties can submit motions on any contemporary topic for debate. After a concerted push by grassroots activists, more than 150 constituency parties (CLPs) have submitted motions on Brexit, an unprecedented number. For comparison, the topic with the second highest number of motions submitted – the NHS – has been put forward by 10 CLPs.However, the motions are not identical. The majority call for a second referendum directly, some express preference for an election, others call for an EEA-style Brexit. When different motions are submitted on one topic, delegates from the local parties who submitted motions, as well as trade union representatives, meet the shadow cabinet member responsible, in this case Keir Starmer, to agree a composite motion to be put to the conference floor for a vote. This is usually a compromise taking in all the elements of the different motions.\u0026nbspUsually this is a straightforward process, because there are only a handful of delegates and union reps in the room. This time, there are likely to be more than 100 people in the room from all the local parties who submitted motions, so things could get complicated.The final version is likely to be a compromise which expresses preference for an election but keeps the option of a referendum on the table. And Labour\u0027s governing body, the national executive committee, could offer a replacement statement of its own for the vote instead.“My worry about a second referendum is that they will be holding the pen,” she said. “What will the referendum be on?”And she added that some Labour-supporting leave voters might feel the party didn’t trust them. “I do worry about it, because I think a lot of people will feel sold-out,” she said. “Some people will think: ‘How many times do you ask before you get the answer you want?’”Another shadow cabinet minister, Richard Burgon, warned of what he called “a dangerous situation for the whole political class”.Asked about the prospect of a people’s vote, the shadow justice secretary echoed concerns expressed by shadow chancellor John McDonnell. “I have a real worry that it would unleash the populist right wing,” he said, adding: “I think the role of the Labour party now is to reduce isions and bring people together.”Meanwhile, Steve Howell, who oversaw Labour’s digital strategy in 2017 and has written a book about the campaign, warned that a referendum would be “a gift to Farage and co”.And Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite and a staunch supporter of the Labour leadership, told the BBC’s Jon Pienaar he doesn’t believe “remain” should be an option on the ballot paper in the event of another referendum.“The referendum shouldn’t be on: ‘Do we want to go back into the European Union?’”, he said. “The people have already decided on that. We very rarely have referendums in this country. The people have decided against my wishes and my union’s wishes, but they’ve decided.”Corbyn and McDonnell have both said in recent weeks that they will not rule out the possibility of a fresh referendum, if they cannot secure a general election. Labour strategists, however, fear they will alienate leave-backing voters in the party’s traditional heartlands if they appear to be seeking to reverse Brexit.Labour hopes that if Theresa May struggles to get her Brexit deal through parliament, it can push her to call a general election – allowing Labour to take over negotiations with Brussels.However, the party’s activists overwhelmingly favour a referendum, creating a rare rift between Corbyn and some of the members who joined the party to support him. Some delegates in Liverpool sported T-shirts and badges with the slogan “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit”.A “people’s vote” was overwhelmingly the most popular issue raised by constituency Labour parties (CLPs) that submitted so-called “contemporary motions” to conference – but the final wording was negotiated at a packed meeting on Sunday evening, chaired by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer.Starmer held a series of one-to-one meetings throughout the day in the hope of reaching a compromise.Grassroots delegates groups including the youth group FFS and the leftwing groups Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a People’s Vote held briefing meetings, to agree their stance.Around 75 delegates came for the briefing ahead of the composite negotiations in a room so packed that delegates had to sit on the floor, organisers said.Though Corbyn, McDonnell and others have repeatedly said they will not rule out a people’s vote, they are under pressure to agree to a firmer, favourable position.People’s Vote campaigners held a well-attended rally in Liverpool on Sunday, close to the conference centre.Labour is now due to elect a second deputy leader, alongside party veteran Tom Watson, as part of a controversial set of rule-changes agreed by delegates on Sunday. Some campaigners hope a pro-referendum candidate will stand, as a way of piling fresh pressure on the leadership over the issue.Eloise Todd, of Best for Britain, said, “Labour’s new female deputy leader should be someone who represents the grassroots of the party, and that means giving the people, not politicians, the final say on the Brexit deal, which is what the overwhelming majority of party members support.”Watson added to Corbyn’s discomfort at the weekend by telling the Observer his party should “go out and argue” for a new referendum, if Labour members demand it.“Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour party back to its members,” he said. “So if the people’s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it.” He added: “That is what happens when you return the party to the members.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9650ce5dbdcc118402d86605bf6689120971d417/0_154_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34675bbef4139ec4632d3ba74aa8d402","title":"guarded labour conference targets the enemy within","story":"The euphoria has worn off, progress in the polls has stalled and explanations are requiredA year ago, the Labour party conference in Brighton was more like a four-day celebration. Mostly of Jeremy Corbyn. Against the odds, the Labour leader had rubbed out the Tory overall majority with an energised campaign and the party had come back from the dead. It was a defeat that felt like a victory and the conference treated it as such. It became almost obligatory for every speaker to begin their turns with their personal thanks and indebtedness to Jeremy. The more critical the speaker had previously been, the longer the eulogy was expected to be. Tom Watson’s lasted for about 10 minutes. Even he was cringing by the end.Twelve months on and some of the euphoria has worn off. Despite the Tories having achieved nothing of any note and being openly at war with one another over Brexit, Labour has failed to make any progress in the polls. In a two-horse race for who would make the best prime minister, Corbyn is still coming third – just behind Theresa May and a long way behind “Don’t know”.The mood in the conference hall at Liverpool now is more reflective. Guarded even. Delegates sense there may be another general election in the offing and they want to know why they aren’t clear favourites to win it. Just imagine the shame of being thought to be even more hopeless than the Tories. Explanations are required.After finding one common enemy in the mainstream media – to make a point, the newspapers have this year been located in the dog exercise area – the conference hall settled down to try to agree what it would be talking about. Though not before deciding what it wouldn’t be talking about. It wouldn’t be talking about antisemitism in the party, because there was no need. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, said all outstanding complaints of antisemitism had now been successfully resolved. She didn’t explain how.What was needed was a system of permanent open selection where any MP could be deselected at any time. Any MP who didn’t do exactly what the constituency Labour party wanted when it wanted could be given the boot. “How can we tolerate MPs who defy the whip and vote with the Tories and the rightwing media?” asked one delegate. He’s going to have a hell of a shock when he discovers Corbyn voted against his party on 428 occasions, and seven times with the Tory majority. A token speaker who observed that MPs had to appeal to a constituency rather wider than a few hundred members to get elected was given the cold shoulder.Curiously, the one place where some kind of cooperation and unity was on offer was at Momentum’s fringe festival. In previous years The World Transformed has felt like little more than a cheerleading operation for Corbyn but now it has gone beyond that into something rather more serious. There are still a few fairly bonkers events, such as “Origami for Peace” and “A war-game based on ‘A Very British Coup’ in which 50 players re-enact the Labour party of the 1980s and try to prevent the malign deep state from frustrating the creation of a socialist vision”, but most are rather more what you might expect from the main conference.Hard to believe, but not so long ago Ed Miliband was considered to be on the far left of the Labour party. Now he’s more recognisable as a centrist dad – with a nice sideline as a chatshow host – but he’s still treated with affection, if not as royalty, by audiences and he managed to chair a panel on the economy in a way that managed to unite everyone, from the right of the party to the far left. Quite some feat. And one that may not be repeated again all week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63beca449c6db725027bf7334a55a37daba30ba1/0_142_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f68e2028cda95a68afb39b56b38cd3","title":"jeremy corbyn young labour activists party conference corbynista brexit","story":"Young members back the leader, but Brexit is a faultlineFive young Labour activists – all of whom voted for Jeremy Corbyn and back the grassroots revival – talk about the party, their politics and why they joined. But after a summer of rows over Brexit and antisemitism, is their support for their leader and would-be prime minister still solid?It was the former Labour leader Ed Miliband’s 2013 conference speech that inspired Dillon, then 18, to join the party, but it is the consistent swerve “back to the left, to what the party first stood for” that has the founder of Skipton Young Labour hooked.Now studying history and politics at the University of Hull, Dillon has seen himself go from “a curiosity” at local branch meetings, where he was always the youngest person in the room, to being part of a passionate, lively movement. “We knocked on doors and campaigned so hard in 2014, that we achieved our first Labour councillor in Craven district council in 20 years,” he says, proudly. “I was at the count and it was a fantastic night, it put that flame, that spark of hope that you can change things.”Dillon, whose dad works as an immigration officer and whose mum is a domestic cleaner, travelled to the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in central London to see Corbyn elected Labour leader in 2015.The charges of antisemitism within the party have been upsetting, he says. “We have a proud tradition of solidarity and standing up to racism and there is no room for antisemitism.” It is essential that the party “are actively rooting out and expelling those iniduals”, but he finds it “a disgrace that nothing at all has happened about the Tories’ Islamophobia”.Khan has already worked on two general election campaigns, stood for election as a local councillor representing his home ward in Kirklees, and spent nine months in Brussels working on education policy with trade unions across Europe. The late MP Jo Cox was his mentor. “She was really welcoming and invited me to a campaign session to learn the ropes and encouraged me to get involved with the trade union movement,” he says. Khan chats to me over the phone from his bedroom in Manchester, where he is studying politics and modern history. He grew up in Liversedge, West Yorkshire, on the same street – “just two doors down” – from where his mum, a teaching assistant, was born.“My family have always voted Labour but they weren’t massively involved.” Khan is a GMB trade union rep, a communications officer and an activist for Batley Labour. For him, like many of his peers, “Corbyn is a breath of fresh air because he’s shown the country that it doesn’t have to be the way it is.”Khan believes wholeheartedly in Corbyn’s politics. “He has bold economic policies, he has made a different political environment and he listens to people – see him in PMQs when he asks questions people have raised with him.”Khan is keen to see how the question of a second referendum will play out at party conference. “I’m a trade unionist and our line is that a final Brexit deal should be put to the public.”He plays down the isions within the party that are blamed on Corbyn. As for Momentum, he is impressed but hasn’t joined. “They’re doing a good job of mobilising and creating a mass movement. Their events – such as taking a festival approach at a traditional party conference – are a really good thing.”Khan wants his party “to keep making a difference to working people’s lives”. So, what now? “Focus on taking the Tories to task on a daily basis. Believe in the vision Corbyn puts forward for Britain.”Growing up as a Tumblr teen, many of the theories that shaped Mirwitch’s ideas on race, feminism and class came from essays and memes shared on an idiosyncratic corner of the internet. She is articulate, thoughtful and passionate as the chair of London Young Labour and a proud Jewish socialist.“I’m not a Corbynite,” she says, near apologetic. “I’m a Labourite, I don’t believe in factions. I didn’t back Corbyn originally because I thought he lacked credibility and was on a different page to where the public was.” She laughs. “I’m proud to have been proved wrong. Jeremy speaks really well and he’s straight-talking. Politically, I agree with his policies and so much of what he says and the 2017 general election proved people really believed in his vision.” What initially put her off? “Everything I was reading. The headlines – what people were saying about us being out of government for 1,000 years.”Mirwitch joined the Labour party at 16, after the coalition government came in, angry and frustrated at increases in tuition fees and cuts to the education maintenance allowance. Born in west London to a midwife and postman, now both retired, she went to the London School of Economics to read social policy and promptly got involved in student activism. “I really enjoyed it it changed my view of how we can organise and campaign. Knocking on people’s doors and seeing how you could change people’s minds was really inspiring.”What has she made of the party’s antisemitism crisis? “I don’t think Corbyn handled it wrongly,” she says, “but things could have been dealt with quicker. It’s always been an issue but it is a positive that people are talking about it and seem to care in a way they didn’t when Ken Livingstone repeatedly made his comments.” Sadiq Khan, she thinks, “is a fantastic example of how to rebuild the trust with the Jewish community”.For Mirwitch, the future is undoubtedly a socialist, Corbyn-led Labour. “It’s difficult as a young person in Britain today to be a Tory,” she says. “You look at the housing market we see the degradation of all our services, the effects of cuts… How can you support a leader like Theresa May or Boris Johnson running around being so awful unless you come from huge privilege?”Milligan is furious with the Labour leadership. The acting student and activist joined the party when she was in sixth form, initially inspired by Corbyn. “The default laziness was that I knew I would always vote Labour,” she says. Milligan stops to explain that she comes from “a long line of lefties”. Both her parents, who “met in communist Prague”, work for trade unions and both of her late grandfathers were former trade union general secretaries.“I didn’t think I needed to join Labour as a member, but actually, when Jeremy became leader, I felt really represented. The ideas he was talking about, like his view on using quantitative easing to fund public services, on nationalising the railways, they were economically transformative – but yes, I am disillusioned now,” she says, sighing. “I don’t feel represented any more.”Milligan says her friends from home often tell her to shut up when she talks about Brexit, but notes: “Even they’ve started talking about it when they found out Wetherspoons weren’t going to sell Jägermeister any more.”To her it’s clear that Corbyn and McDonnell “need to stop looking back at the EU as it was perceived in the Tony Benn years as a club for fat cats. They need to realise the Labour movement has made the EU work for us, we have turned it round and made it the bedrock of rights that no UK government can overturn on its own.”Little seemed more difficult to Cobb than getting her dissertation done. But as she worked in the university library through the night of the 2015 general election, something snapped. “I felt so frustrated watching the live coverage and knew I wanted to make a difference there and then.” She joined the Labour party – “I literally had to Google how to do it” – and has since become an active member of young Labour in Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, galvanised in large part by Corbyn.Has her support for Corbyn ever wavered? “No, not at all. He’s human! Look at him and his politics and what he says. Anyone who thinks the Labour party as a whole is antisemitic or that Jeremy is racist …” she pauses, exasperated. “It’s unfounded.”Cobb has made many new friends since she became politically active. “I didn’t know much before,” she admits, “but I’m also a Momentum member now as well and their meetings are really informative and you get a range of people from throughout the borough.”Some 15 to 20 members get together every month and Cobb has become a campaigner on everything from animal welfare to school cuts. “We had a lot of interest leafleting outside different schools,” she says. “We put together numbers on all the funding cuts affecting inidual schools and a lot of concerned parents got in touch.” For her, the future of the party lies in grassroots activism because “it engages local communities. Issues like homelessness, which is huge, need to be addressed by government but by us on the ground, too.” As for the party’s near future, Cobb is certain: “I can see Jeremy becoming the next prime minister.”• Additional reporting by Lindsay Riley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddcbde6e056f9ecee4b77fac81391523395fb58c/0_267_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f162332a206cc9d3366bc1fc18c7212e","title":"jezfest did not make a profit says labour","story":"Treasurer says party dipped into its reserves to meet cost of north London event in JuneLabour has confirmed that its one-day music and politics festival Labour Live did not make a profit. The party’s treasurer, Diana Holland, said she did not believe a desire to make money was the reason for running it.The event, nicknamed JezFest, featured speeches from Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, performances from the bands Clean Bandit and the Magic Numbers, and political discussions.More than 13,000 tickets were sold for the June event in Tottenham, north London. Prices were cut to £10 in an attempt to boost sales. After a slow start to the day, the festival was well attended by a erse audience.Johanna Baxter, a former member of the party’s ruling national executive committee, asked at the Labour conference how much the festival cost to organise, whether a profit was made and whether it would be repeated.Holland replied: “No, Labour Live did not make a profit. I don’t think that was why it was organised however, there was a net cost. It’ll be included in next year’s financial report.“But this was met by part of the reserve fund we have established in addition to the general election fund, so absolutely none of that was touched but we did use some of our reserves in order to fund that.”Corbyn’s keynote speech at the event revived memories of his appearance at Glastonbury last year as he called on festivalgoers to come together to eradicate inequality.He said the Conservatives were “incapable of governing” and ideologically wedded to free market economic theories that had led to a decline in both the quality and availability of public services.Political festivals are growing in popularity, with Momentum’s parallel event to Labour’s annual conference, The World Transformed, sparking spinoffs around the country. This month around 1,000 people attended the Big Tent Ideas festival in Cambridgeshire for a series of discussions on subjects ranging from heritage in the digital age to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use.Although the Cambridgeshire event was touted as non-party political, it was dominated by Conservative party members and centre-right ideas. It is unclear whether the festival, which took place in the grounds of a stately home, made a profit.Beyond party politics, the Byline festival – billed as promoting independent journalism and free speech – took place for a second year this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e99fed6e14acc9cf10b5c5bde1e0dc29a428175/578_375_3903_2342/master/3903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f8151e9fb8effd95989406188dc15c","title":"may to face pressure to ditch chequers plan in cabinet showdown","story":"Brexiters to set out alternative vision for EU exit, before cabinet meets for the first time since PM’s Salzburg humiliation Theresa May will come under intense pressure from leading Brexiters on Monday to ditch her Chequers proposals and back a free trade deal with the EU instead as she faces a bruising cabinet showdown in the wake of the disastrous Salzburg summit.The former Brexit secretary David Davis and leading Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg are among those backing a report by the Institute of Economic Affairs which is expected to set out an alternative plan for a hard Brexit departure from the EU.The launch, attended by a series of high-profile Brexiters, comes just hours before the prime minister comes face to face with her cabinet for the first time since her humiliation at the hands of EU leaders who rejected key elements of her Chequers plan.Immigration will be one of the key points of discussion at the hastily arranged meeting a week before Tory conference at which May is expected to argue for strict controls to reassure Brexiters and boost her leadership in the face of open revolt.Several cabinet ministers have privately expressed dismay at the fate of May’s Chequers proposals and are understood to be advocating a move towards a Canada-style trade deal. At least two are thought to be prepared to raise the issue directly.One cabinet source said: “Chequers in its present form is a non-starter for the EU so it’s time for us to look at the alternatives. We should at least look again at the prospect of a free trade agreement.”However, the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, was unequivocal on Sunday that such a proposal was “off the table” as it would mean reverting to the EU’s backstop solution for Northern Ireland which would create a hard border down the Irish sea.“People need to read the small print, not just of our proposals, but the EU’s proposals, because what they’re suggesting is not just a free trade deal but for us to stay locked in, or for Northern Ireland specifically to stay locked into the customs union,” he said.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKER“Now that would be a clear carve up of the United Kingdom. It’s off the table in the terms that the EU would even plausibly at this stage accept.”Those in cabinet backing a shift towards a Canada-style deal deny that it would lead to a border in the Irish Sea, although it would be dependent on the EU agreeing to soften its position on border checks if a Brexit deal looked within reach.No 10 sources said that alternative proposals for the border had already been rejected by Brussels. One said: “There aren’t any easy solutions to any of these problems. We know that the idea of a Canada-style free trade deal cannot and would not happen without the backstop.”One cabinet minister warned that colleagues should wait to see what counter-proposals to Chequers were put forward by Brussels in early October before looking at other options: “If they wholesale reject Chequers then we will have to do something before we get to no deal, but not until then.”It comes after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, appeared to suggest that the government was pivoting away from its existing plans towards a free trade deal, as demanded by the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party.There is also likely to be a standoff at the cabinet over the prime minister’s post-Brexit plans for immigration, with May and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, pushing for an end to preferential access for EU citizens and focus on a global migration scheme.Other cabinet colleagues, led by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, are understood to harbour some doubts about the proposals and are likely to argue the benefits of a flexible system for skilled workers. Hunt and Brexiter Penny Mordaunt will be in New York for the UN general assembly.Meanwhile, leading Brexiters will publish their alternative plan, written by trade guru Shanker Singham, for a future trading relationship with the EU, setting out the benefits of striking out alone to do deals with the rest of the world. It will also suggest a new regulatory environment and present their solutions for the issue of the Irish border.  At an event in central London, key Tory figures are expected to repeat their call for May to “chuck Chequers” and adopt their proposals instead, arguing that the EU’s rejection of her plans in Salzburg meant that they were dead.Raab also dismissed suggestions over the weekend that May could call a snap general election in the autumn to save her Brexit plans. “It’s for the birds. It’s not going to happen,” he told the BBC.He insisted the government would keep negotiating with the EU on the basis of Chequers: “This is a bump in the road. We will hold our nerve, we will keep our cool and we will keep negotiating in good faith. I think we need to keep these negotiations going,.”But Raab added: “What we are not going to do is be dictated to. The UK is one of the biggest economies in Europe, if not in the world. We have come up with a serious set of proposals … We are not just going to flit from plan to plan like some sort of diplomatic butterfly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4f1f4f55fa9a3b093fdc86ce216d1564fadcfb/0_155_5329_3197/master/5329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ca3367074045535f571bf6d70a97607","title":"sophie walker womens equality party interview","story":"The Women’s Equality party leader on what Brexit would mean for women, and why some MPs are thinking of defecting to her partySophie Walker founded the Women’s Equality party three years ago out of frustration with mainstream politicians’ progress towards gender equality. At the last general election she stood (and lost) in Shipley against the Conservative MP and men’s rights campaigner Philip Davies, renowned for his attacks on political correctness. She is a former journalist.Young women and girls’ happiness has declined sharply in a decade, according to a survey out this week – what’s that telling us?I think we’re a very long way from understanding that all of our systems are still built around a template of men, and women and girls face a deeply uncomfortable existence around the margins of that template. And until we start to redraw it in a way that understands that the old models don’t work, we’re never going to be able to solve that general unhappiness that is as a result of being second-class citizens.That survey did find more young women identifying as feminists…Yes, and that’s fabulous. It’s cheering to see attitudes toward the word feminism changing. I lived as a teenager through the late 80s and early 90s, the age of lad culture – Nuts and Zoo, the sudden acceptability of lap-dancing and strip clubs and banter. I think it set women’s liberation back a lot because there was this idea that you had to mould yourself around this very aggressive male model, and feminism was for whingers.Do you think #MeToo galvanised young women?It’s done some really important things, one of which is to awaken an understanding that women standing side by side achieve more than if we just keep swallowing the lines fed to us by the self-help industry, such as that it’s on us as iniduals to try harder to break down centuries of discrimination. The other important thing #MeToo has demonstrated is how quick vested interests are to trigger a backlash.Any specific impacts of Brexit on women being overlooked?When we talk about immigration, we are talking about people’s openness to travel and work. Any points-based immigration system based on minimum salary, assets and education will mean systems discriminating against women.Recently you tweeted that you said “clitoris” in your party conference speech and didn’t get asked on the radio to discuss it, but Vince Cable was invited on to discuss saying “erotic spasm”. Is that a double standard?What double standard are you talking about?Is it a gender thing, or because the Liberal Democrats have MPs and you haven’t?There’s a whole lot of stuff going on here. As soon as we set up the WEP we were dismissed as a funny little special-interest party – it took us six months to get out of the lifestyle pages. The lives, experiences and needs of women are seen as secondary to all the more important business rather than absolutely fundamental. Women’s experiences are always the thing you think of afterwards and it’s extremely frustrating to live that experience as a leader of a political party formed to change it.You aim to devise “nickable policies” - which one would you most like to see stolen?Equal investment in care as in construction: pound for pound the same investment in care as in physical infrastructure.

It’s an extremely difficult conversation, made harder to have by people seeking to shut down and silence opinions. We’re going to have a consultation of all our members to find a way forward and I’m working really hard to find options that don’t insist people have to come down on one side or the other.

By contrast, spending on the state pension will be £1.7bn higher by 2021.Field said the benefit cuts were behind increases in food bank use and destitution. He said: “A £37bn attack has been mounted on the living standards of many of our fellow citizens to such an extent that possibly millions struggle to keep on top of their rent, pay the bills and buy adequate food.“Likewise, an unknown number are unable to clothe their children properly before sending them to school where all too many of these children not only rely on free school dinners as a cornerstone of their diet, but on breakfast and supper clubs as well.”The reductions in benefit spending come during a period when costs have risen for the poorest families, leaving them using a disproportionately high share of their income on housing, fuel, food and childcare.Field called on the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to commit Labour to reversing cuts to working age benefits.The chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, Alison Garnham, said: “Cuts and freezes have taken family budgets to the bone as costs rise and there is more pain to come as the two-child limit for tax credits and universal credit, the bedroom tax, the benefit cap and the rollout of universal credit push families deeper into poverty.”A government spokesperson said: “We want our welfare system to provide a strong safety net while being fair and sustainable for the future. That’s why we spend around £90bn a year helping those that need it, including people out of work or on a low income.“But we are also committed to supporting people into work – the best way to lift people out of poverty. Since 2010, we have seen over 3 million more people find work and the number of workless households is at the lowest level since comparable records began.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294269797/Libby-Brooks.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24da21f9bbc736be7bad58838a7214d\" alt=\"Libby Brooks","title":"theresa may makes statement outside no 10","story":"Prime minister says UK needs to hear from EU on what real alternatives areThat’s all from the blog today, thanks so much for your comments. You can read the full story here:Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described May’s statement as “dreadful” and her tactics “hugely damaging”.“The Prime Minister’s statement was dreadful. The EU’s view of the Chequers plan was bluntly and clearly expressed in Salzburg yesterday, but should not have come as a surprise to the UK Government, given that it was not a new position.“Clearly, the Prime Minister has not been listening – Chequers is a dead duck but if her tactic now is to try and double down on those proposals and then seek to blame the EU for a no-deal outcome, then she will do huge damage to all of those she is supposed to serve.“It would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit and whose interests in this process have been ignored at every turn by the UK Government.“What the latest development shows more clearly than ever is that the only remotely workable way for Brexit to happen is for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. If the Prime Minister is not prepared to do that, then Brexit shouldn’t happen. A ‘No deal’ or ‘no detail‘ Brexit are simply not acceptable – particularly for Scotland, where we did not vote for any of this.”Yesterday, Sturgeon wrote to the leaders of the UK’s opposition parties asking them to join her in pressing for an extension to next March’s deadline for leaving the EU to avoid “an economic cliff edge”.Cabinet ministers have been responding on Twitter, including some warning the EU in stronger terms.The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has been an advocate for a soft Brexit, said she has spoken to May this afternoon and been reassured of her commitment to get a negotiated deal.Business leaders have reacted with some alarm to the comments by the prime minister on the distance between the two sides.CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said negotiators on both sides must change tack. “Rejection of Chequers helps nobody,” she said. “Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs.”Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also reproached both sides for the impasse. “While the Prime Minister’s determination to reach a deal is appreciated, businesses tell us over and over that the time for posturing from both sides is over,” he said. “Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said the summit was a “failure” and that the EU was not acting in good faith. However, he praised the prime minister, saying she had showed “steely resolve.”He said it was time to admit the Chequers plan would not work for both the EU and the UK and start making plans for a Canada-style free trade deal. May made it clear in her speech that the EU has said it cannot countenance such a deal without Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union to prevent customs checks on the border.“It is time for the government to start putting forward as its plan a Canada-style free trade agreement for the whole of the UK. This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU’s proposal,” he said. “Moreover, as every vote in parliament has so far shown, it is the one way which could command a majority in the House of Commons.“On the matter of the UK’s border with Ireland, the EU can have the solutions proposed by the ERG that respect the integrity of the Single Market and which have been supported by the DUP,” he said.“The Prime Minister has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies. The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.”The pound is on course for its biggest one-day drop in 2018 against the dollar, after Theresa May said Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an “impasse”.Traders took fright as May’s comments were taken as a sign that a no deal Brexit is an increasingly likely outcome of talks, creating uncertainty which unsettles traders.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that “no deal is not an option” and slammed the government’s negotiating tactics. However, his response does not include a demand that May drop her current plans and, interestingly, also calls on the EU to end the “political games.”Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.EU sources were relaxed about May’s speech. They see it as as a “positioning” ahead of the Tory party conference after what they see as a self-inflicted wound in Salzburg.May’s demands that the EU come up with alternative proposals are seen as domestic politicking as the EU’s position in Brexit has been clear from the outset.While May’s failure to come with a proposal on the Irish border nine months after agreeing to one incensed EU leaders, it is said that it was Downing Street’s briefing to British journalists that some member states were being more sympathetic to the UK than others that prompted Macron to intervene. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP who back up May’s minority government, said there was “utter inflexibility and bullying tactics” from the EU. He said the EU was not negotiating in good faith or within the parameters of the Belfast agreement. “It seems to be their way or no way,” he told the BBC. He said there would be no regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that the DUP could accept.Dodds said the issue of Northern Ireland had been “abused” by remainers and EU leaders. “The border issue has been elevated to a far greater extent than it should,” he said. The Lib Dems are the first out of the traps to comment on the prime minister’s statement. The party’s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says May should recall parliament, an idea unlikely to be popular with Labour who have their party conference next week.Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable,” he said. Instead of pontificating to television cameras, May must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.Here’s some more of the reaction:From the New Statesman’s Stephen BushFrom the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg:From the ’s Jennifer Rankin:From the WSJ’s Bojan Pancevski:Here are some of the key quotes from May’s statement in Downing Street. On the progress of the negotiations:I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago. On a Canada-style free trade deal and a customs border down the Irish Sea: It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.On the Irish backstop:The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. On red lines in the negotiations:As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.On her treatment in SalzburgThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.On the referendum result: The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.On the prospect of no deal:No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

There was enough in patches to get the job done and only a heavy defeat at home to Toronto on Friday raises a fraction of doubt that Leeds could be dragged into the Million Pound Game.It has been a season nobody associated with Leeds, the reigning Super League champions, could have expected or wished to endure but mercifully, the finish line is now almost in sight.While Halifax more than played their part in a compelling first half that ended 6-6, the weaknesses of this Leeds side were also exposed. “There’s lots going on behind the scenes that nobody will see,” Sinfield said. “But the off-season gives us a chance to press the button on some of those things and allows us to move forward.”Halifax, the Qualifiers’ only part-time side, played their part here – as they have done all summer. The first meeting of these West Yorkshire clubs for 15 years was anyone’s contest at the break with Richie Myler’s early try for Leeds cancelled out by Steve Tyrer’s effort five minutes before half-time.Had the ball bounced the other way in a couple of key moments thereafter, this could have been an even tougher afternoon for Leeds. But when Brad Dwyer scored twice in the space of six minutes it took the game away from the hosts who, under the new league structure in 2019, have a far better – and realistic – chance of promotion.“Leeds were nervous at half-time but a couple of class iniduals took the game away from us,” their coach, Richard Marshall, said.Dwyer was one of those, with his quick-fire double making it 18-6 before Liam Sutcliffe scored five minutes later. From there Halifax understandably began to tire and Leeds took full advantage with tries by Cameron Smith and Luke Briscoe settling any Rhinos nerves once and for all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd7ca441f4d4f6c5231c20117f265ba1315b061/0_151_5130_3079/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1567bb720d7aa8945976c57f0074ed87","title":"saracens gloucester premiership match report","story":"• Saracens 38-15 Gloucester• Injured Manu Tuilagi out of England training squadThe match had been billed as the battle of the fly-halves but in truth it was never really a contest. Owen Farrell comfortably outshone Danny Cipriani in their personal duel but, thanks to the performance of his dominant forwards – led by the relentless Maro Itoje – he had considerable help. Eddie Jones was not just being complimentary when he described Cipriani as “superman” last week but even the caped crusader could not hold back a tide as strong as this.As Cipriani did not play particularly badly, so Farrell was not flawless, his goalkicking aside. There were a couple of uncharacteristically loose passes but anyone in attendance eager to see Cipriani make a mockery of his England snub by upstaging the Saracens fly-half left disappointed.“Danny has had setbacks in his life before, otherwise he would be constantly in the England squad,” the Gloucester head coach, Johan Ackermann, said. “The good thing is he is an experienced player he has experienced the disappointment before.”Jones claimed Cipriani was a player best suited to a highlights reel last week but, save for a line break early in the second half and an assist for Mark Atkinson’s consolation try, there was little of note on show. Farrell’s would be more worth a watch, provided it included the lambasting he gave David Strettle for showing a moment’s hesitation when chasing his grubber. It remains to be seen if Jones intends to move him from inside-centre to fly-half for England but Mark McCall is in no doubt as to his quality when wearing No 10.“He was incredibly influential,” the Saracens director of rugby said. “It wasn’t just his skill set, his passing and kicking. The physical tone that he set was incredible. Vocally he’s off the charts as well. He’s just this incredible player who adds in every way.”Jones, with an England camp to prepare, was not in attendance but missed little he did not already know. Nine Saracens players were due in Bristol on Sunday night and on this evidence one could make the case for one or two more. This was a reminder of Saracens’ forward power against a Gloucester side who, while upwardly mobile, were given a harsh dose of reality.Itoje was deployed at blindside flanker – McCall’s take on which row he plays in was a pithy “it doesn’t matter” – and, while there was the occasional lapse in discipline, he was colossal. “He’s a guy in a hurry to be better,” McCall said. “He’s been good all season and today he was great again.”Along with Itoje, Mako Vunipola impressed, as did George Kruis and Michael Rhodes in the No 7 jersey and together they laid the platform for Saracens’ fourth consecutive bonus-point victory this season. It puts them top and, including the back end of last season, it is the 10th match in a row they have managed four or more tries – a Premiership record on the same day Richard Wigglesworth set his own for 266 appearances in the competition.With the wind at their backs, Saracens raced into a 24-3 lead at half-time – Itoje scoring two tries, Strettle the other – while Sean Maitland and Alex Lozowski added two more after the break. Saracens have been a little slow to move through the gears this season but here their forwards were in overdrive against Gloucester, unbeaten in their first three matches.A Farrell penalty was quickly followed by Maitland’s line break which freed Strettle outside him to score his first try back at Allianz Park since his return from Clermont. Gloucester had plenty of ball for the ensuing 10 minutes but struggled to make much headway, the odd wriggle from Jason Woodward aside, but too often the ball was coughed up in the face of Saracens’ relentless defence.Saracens’ second try came when Farrell, with the benefit of advantage, kicked high and caught Woodward on the hop behind the posts. The ball bounced up off the crossbar and into Itoje’s hands for a simple finish. His second was more difficult, albeit also from close in, and came after Billy Twelvetrees had put Gloucester on the board with a penalty. To compound matters the visitors had lost Lewis Ludlow (head) and Ruan Ackermann (knee) to injury.Maitland’s score early in the second half brought up the bonus point – Farrell floating a delicious pass just out of Twelvetrees’ reach for Alex Goode, who shipped on to the Scotland international. Lozowski came off the bench to add the fifth after a dart down the right by Liam Williams before Atkinson, another replacement, dummied over for the visitors’ first try. Charlie Sharples added the second but by that stage Gloucester’s goose was cooked.Exeter’s Ben Moon has been called into the England squad for Joe Marler, while Jordan Olowofela, of Leicester, has been called up for his clubmate Manu Tuilagi. Nick Schonert (Worcester) and Ben Youngs (Leicester) are also out with injury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1038456ae07419fc28a1a184546363f9db9921c/0_113_4530_2717/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6ff3e92bb04fc115c3a02ade08e261","title":"anthony joshua knocks out alexander povetkin in pictures","story":"Anthony Joshua beats Alexander Povetkin in seven rounds to retain his IBF, WBA Super, WBO \u0026amp IBO heavyweight titles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/207575aa16f820ec4dfb0780086ea07eac6a349f/0_372_5584_3351/master/5584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af5bb348d8813e22a0a854c3dc9b4da","title":"brett kavanaugh accuser set to testify before congress","story":"Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused supreme court nominee of sexual assault, to appear ‘despite actual threats to safety and life’Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, will testify before the Senate judiciary committee on Thursday, in proceedings likely to become a decisive moment in the confirmation of the conservative judge. A statement issued on Sunday by lawyers for the professor at Palo Alto University, who alleges Kavanaugh assaulted her at a part in the early 1980s, said an open hearing would take place at 10am on Thursday.Kavanaugh, who has denied the allegations, is also expected to appear.“Despite actual threats to her safety and her life, Dr Ford believes it is important for senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her,” the statement said.Ford’s lawyers confirmed that a number of other witnesses to the alleged assault would not be called. This included Mark Judge, a high school friend of Kavanaugh who was allegedly present in the room at the high school party where the violent assault is alleged to have occurred. Judge has said he has no recollection of events described by Ford and does not wish to testify.Senate Republicans on the judiciary committee, all of whom are men, are weighing up how they will question the 51 year-old. Reports have indicated that chairman Chuck Grassley is seeking to hire a female attorney to question the witness, a move Ford’s team have opposed.The issue was still unresolved on Sunday, according to the statement from Ford’s attorneys.Grassley has also rejected an application from Ford’s lawyers for her to appear after Kavanaugh, which would give her the opportunity to rebut his comments.Counsel for the chairman’s office wrote to Ford’s attorneys on Sunday to inform them Grassley would “do everything in his power to provide a safe, comfortable, and dignified forum” for the hearing.The outcome of Kavanaugh’s confirmation could determine the ideological balance of the court for years. Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement prompted Donald Trump’s second nomination, was the swing vote on a number of key decisions.Trump, himself accused by at least 16 women of sexual misconduct, has offered his full support to Kavanaugh. In a series of Twitter posts on Friday, he described the judge as a “fine man, with an impeccable reputation” and attacked Ford’s credibility, asking: “Why didn’t someone call the FBI 36 years ago?”A number of senior female Republicans hit back. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday: “Every accuser always deserves the right to be heard. But at the same time I think the accused deserves the right to be heard.”Haley added: “Accusers go through a lot of trauma. Some handle it one way, some handle it another. Regardless, it’s not something we want to do to blame the accuser or to try and second guess the accuser.”Senator Susan Collins of Maine branded Trump’s tweets “completely inappropriate and wrong”.“I was appalled by the president’s tweet,” she said. “We know that allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist.”Nonetheless, Republican senators on the judiciary committee have indicated they support Kavanaugh. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told Fox News Sunday he would view Ford’s appearance “from a prism of being reasonable and fair to Judge Kavanaugh”.He said: “Everything I know about Judge Kavanaugh goes against this allegation, goes against Dr Ford. I feel sorry for her, I think she’s being used here. People in my view are using her.”Democrats have urged the FBI to investigate Ford’s allegations, pointing to sexual harassment allegations made against conservative judge Clarence Thomas in 1991 by a law professor, Anita Hill. The FBI conducted a brief investigation into Hill’s claims with bipartisan support during Thomas’s confirmation process. Thomas was confirmed to the supreme court, where he remains, in 52-48 vote.Hill, who was a legal adviser to Thomas during his time in federal government, was called to the Senate to testify. She was publicly lambasted by a number of Republicans, some of whom are still on the judiciary committee. A number of Democratic senators have said they want Ford to avoid the same sort of hostile scrutiny.“I’m going to do everything I can to make sure she can tell her story free of intimidation and the kind of threats she’s getting for coming forward,” Mazie Hirono of Hawaii told CNN on Sunday. Hirono is one of four female Democrats on the judiciary committee.Ford alleges Kavanaugh was drunk at a house party in suburban Washington DC in 1982, and that he pulled her into a room, pinned her down on a bed and tried to take off her clothes. She also alleges he put his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming.In an interview with the Washington Post, she said she was able to escape but remained traumatized by the incident into adulthood, describing it as a “rape attempt”.According to a report in the Post on Saturday, Kavanaugh has been taking practice questions from White House aides. Citing anonymous sources, the paper reported that the judge grew frustrated by practice questions relating to his drinking habits and sexual experience, declining to answer some questions altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b751bc95cfd9ab9d699a11a0defc98a0044637/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ef4a5eebcbf265f03db77dbba69bd5","title":"what masculinity means when youre gay bi or trans ","story":"We’re in the middle of a ‘genderquake’ where the qualities traditionally associated with men are changing daily. So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

He will be a keynote speaker at The World Transformed fringe event in Liverpool on Monday night, discussing what he calls a new “era of the people” and is expected to meet Corbyn privately for the first time.At 67, two years younger than Corbyn, Mélenchon said he saw parallels with the Labour leader’s support base, including the structures of a mass movement and “the paradox of an older man representing a cause that has been powered by millions of young people”. He said it was striking that in UK and France – and with Bernie Sanders in the US – these were older leaders “in some areas seen as caricatures of a certain left and yet we’re also seen as representing something fundamentally different and new”.While Corbyn’s career was inside the Labour party, Mélenchon, a former Trotskyist who began politics as a student activist in the May 1968 movement, spent more than 30 years in the French Socialist party as a senator, a junior minister and was close to the president François Mitterrand, before quitting in 2008, criticising what he called the party’s rightwards shift.Mélenchon said he was not coming to Liverpool with advice for Corbyn but rather to “watch and learn”. He said: “The first of us who wins will be right. We absolutely need a victory that reverses the path of decline that history seems to have taken, where capitalism is triumphant and incapable of doing the minimum to protect people, incapable of handling the financial sphere or climate change. We need a country to reverse that.”Mélenchon said grassroots movements should build on the universal feeling that voters had had enough with ruling elites. “The whole of Europe is in thrall to a wave of ‘dégagisme’ – the desire to kick out a ruling political elite,” he said. He felt the UK’s vote for Brexit was an expression of that.Mélenchon, who championed France’s no vote in the 2005 referendum on the European constitution and who insists on a total renegotiation of what he sees as the EU’s dangerously neoliberal treaties, said he was watching Brexit closely.He said: “The British have a long history of independence and self-determination. They are a rebel people. I think in British collective memory, their extraordinary resistance to Nazism created a great pride and assurance, a self-confidence. The EU managed to make itself odious to the British, just like it has to other people in Europe.“The extraordinary thing is that Britain has a strong culture of democracy, so there was a vote ... I think the leaders hadn’t predicted that the people would respond by voting for Brexit. But they aren’t the only leaders who have been wrong in this area.“For someone like me, watching from the outside, the question is whether Brexit has fixed any of the problems that interest our kind of political movement. Is the sovereignty of the British people any greater after Brexit than before? For the moment, that’s not clear. But so far it has not changed the status and power of company boardrooms, it hasn’t changed the balance of sharing wealth and the UK hasn’t suddenly become more environmentally-minded than before. So I think the reasons which led the British people to reject the European Union will still be present in the everyday reality of the UK.“We’d be wrong to think that British voters’ concerns were simply focused on the country’s relationship to the EU. I think it was also about the relationship to a world that British people have just as much difficulty with as people in France: the financial economy, capitalism without a cause, the end of industry.”Mélenchon said he would continue opposing Macron at home, describing France Unbowed as “the grain of sand that is blocking the machine” of Macron’s proposed overhaul of welfare and labour policies.Asked if he was a populist, Mélenchon said: “For the moment, that word is often used as an accusation by those who fear the people and hate them. And to be clear, there are so many things that can be called populism that the word itself no longer means anything in particular. I don’t fight over words, I fight for reality. The reality is: who has the people with them? Some members of my movement use the word populist. I don’t use it, I create other political concepts and criteria.”Asked about accusations of antisemitism levelled against Corbyn, Mélenchon said: “I don’t believe it. He belongs to a humanist tradition, which is incompatible with antisemitism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f539c31137c8d1752c89a75157a2b4257024582/0_0_3596_2158/master/3596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f201962e8b9db72510c23ee83bc5ec62","title":"no regrets worlds biggest election loser runs for 96th time in canada","story":"John Turmel initially went into politics to legalise gambling and stop getting bustedThe first time John Turmel ran in an election, it was 1979 and his primary aim was to legalise gambling. While his door-knocking efforts earned him just 193 votes, the race marked the start of an obsession that would eventually launch the Canadian into the record books for having contested, and lost, the highest number of elections in the world.Some four decades on, Turmel has contested 95 elections, throwing his hat into the ring for jobs ranging from city councillor to MP. Often running as an independent, the number of votes he receives fluctuates wildly, from 11 to 4,500.Long-winded and prone to campaign ideas that fly in the face of science – such as describing climate change as a hoax – the perennial fringe candidate has racked up a string of bruising headlines over the years. “Super loser fails again,” read one article, while a recent radio appearance dubbed him “politics’ biggest loser”.Turmel is quick to wave off the criticism. “Am I feeling bad? No,” says the 67-year-old in an interview in his cluttered home office in Brantford, a small city of some 99,000 in southern Ontario.To the self-described professional gambler elections are not there to be won or lost, but rather a low-cost means of disseminating ideas.Turmel’s first foray into elections was prompted by a police crackdown on the underground blackjack games he was running in Ottawa. “I kept getting busted,” he says. “So I ran for parliament in 1979 to legalise gambling and stop busting me.”His platform soon expanded to legalising drugs and prostitution as well. “I was called the champion of the gamblers, hookers and dope smokers.”The idea blossomed into a fascination with what Turmel calls “a gentle kind of capitalism,” referring to interest-free barter arrangements such as “time banks”.These arrangements offer people the chance to create an alternative currency, backed by their own goods and services, explains Turmel. “People with no money can basically create their own tokens by monetising their own time.”Convinced that this was an idea whose time had come in Canada, he seized on the elections as a way to spread the word. “So that’s why I kept running,” he says.“I realised that I’m going to have to take advantage of every opportunity to explain how we could save ourselves from poverty, which is created by not enough money. We’ve got lots of wealth, lots of food, lots of clothes, we’ve just got not enough money to buy it.”Clad often in his lucky playing card tie and a white construction helmet emblazoned with the words “Turmel the Engineer” – a reference to his bachelor degree in electrical engineering – he has become a polarising fixture in Canadian elections, referring to himself as the “smartest man on Earth” while describing the masses as “slows”.In recent years he has eschewed going door-to-door for a far more confrontational style of campaigning showing up at all debates – including those he hasn’t been invited to – and regularly being escorted out by police.“I do zero campaigns,” he says. “I go and I sign up, I give them a press release and a press conference and then I’ll go home. And if there’s a debate, I’ll show up.”At times though his unconventional strategy has paid off one month after an Ontario newspaper described him as a “super loser”, a second article detailed the creation of a group committed to launching a local currency.“Mission accomplished,” says Turmel, a note of pride creeping into his voice as he holds up the two articles.The little that he does end up spending comes from his gambling winnings. “I live three blocks from the biggest poker game in the country which has allowed me to finance all my activities,” he says. Two years ago he started receiving a pension, which now supplants the income he says he once earned from poker.While he has stopped playing poker for the most part, he shows little sign of slowing down when it comes to elections – Turmel is currently running in his 96th election campaign, this time for mayor of Brantford, the city where he lives.Looking back on four decades littered with electoral losses, he turns combative when asked whether it has all been worth it.“Who cares? I’m doing my duty. I just show up, do my best – which is my duty – sit back and see what happens.”His voice calms as he adds: “I have no regrets. For a guy with no resources, doing it all with my winnings from mainly illegal games, what have I got to be ashamed of?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a926231b7e28b055edf9fb0812be4efb83b41666/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a65f2e4fb8dc0743adb2d079b5f0f08","title":"potsdam inside the worlds first autonomous tram","story":" goes for a ride on the new AI-driven Combino vehicle developed by SiemensNorbert Gresing shook his head as two teenage boys, deep in conversation and wearing earplugs, stepped out in front of his tram.“This is the type of situation I face every day,” said the tram driver, who has 25 years of experience under his belt, as he rang his bell. The boys, apparently oblivious to the green and white 10-tonne, 19-metre-long vehicle, appeared as bright green figures surrounded by fuzzy yellow dots on the screen in front of Gresing.In this case, the boys were not close enough that the tram had to brake, though it did slow down.But Gresing had little to do with the decision. He was merely sitting in the cab, his hand resting casually on a joystick in case he needed to intervene, while the tram drove itself.The world’s first autonomous tram was launched in unspectacular style in the city of Potsdam, west of Berlin, on Friday.  was the first English-language newspaper to be offered a ride on the vehicle developed by a team of 50 computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists at the German engineering company Siemens.Fitted with multiple radar, lidar (light from a laser), and camera sensors, forming digital eyes that film the tram and its surroundings during every journey, the tram reacts to trackside signals and can respond to hazards faster than a human.Its makers say it is some way from being commercially viable but they do expect it to contribute to the wider field of driverless technology, and have called it an important milestone on the way to autonomous driving.Travelling in real traffic from the tram depot of Potsdam’s transport company ViP, the articulated Combino model tram whirred its way through a high-rise housing settlement in the south-eastern district of Stern on Friday, contending with bikes, prams and cars which sometimes haphazardly crossed its path during the 3.7-mile (6km) route.Halfway into the journey on a windy day with leaves swirling over the tracks, an emergency was staged, whereby a Siemens employee pushed a pram onto one of the many unsignalled walkways running across the path of the tram. After its sensors alerted it, the vehicle responded by braking suddenly. Gresing calmly restarted the automated driving system once the woman had pulled the pram safely back onto the pavement.Along the track, the occasional tram spotter with a notebook and camera captured the historic moment.Gordian Stark, a visitor to InnoTrans 2018, an international transport exhibition taking place in Berlin, observed the tram in operation from the sidelines, and admitted he had initially been sceptical.“Truth be told, it does looks rather underwhelming, a normal low-floor tram, but closer up you see all the discreet technology like the sensors, and to see it tackle real-time traffic and to think this is the future, it’s a bit like what it must have been to witness the transition from horse-drawn to steam trams or gas to electric,” he said.As in many cities in the former communist East Germany, trams have formed the backbone of Potsdam’s public transport system uninterrupted ever since their introduction as horse-drawn vehicles in 1880. Promoted under communism as an efficient public transport method, it has since expanded to cover a route of 18 miles in length.With the city – currently having a population of 172,000 – expanding fast, it is seen as an essential part of its infrastructure. ViP is proud to boast of the new model that runs on renewable energy (wind and solar) and is able to carry up to 250 passengers as the most environmentally friendly form of public transport.Gresing, a native Potsdamer who grew up with trams, said at 63, and semi-retired, he was not concerned about his job security, though he admitted that some of his colleagues were.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theNevertheless, ViP has said in the event of the artificial intelligence (AI) trams being properly introduced, drivers would simply be deployed elsewhere in the system, such as to marshal passengers on the platform or to help people with disabilities or prams, and have vowed that the high-tech trams will not lead to job cuts.“Our main priority is safety,” said Oliver Glaser, the manager of ViP, which has 420 employees and ferries 33 million passengers a year. “And secondly we think it’ll improve efficiency.”Gresing said he only had to recall his most hair-raising experience as a tram driver to consider the advantages of an AI vehicle: “When an elderly man who had left his hearing aid at home pulled out in front of me in his car” . At that point he sounded his bell and managed to bring the tram to a halt. “No one was injured but the car was a write-off,” he said.“It can be a very stressful job: you’re responsible for 250 passengers at a time.

The protest and march was to call for members of the public to be given a vote on the final negotiations of the UK’s exit from the EU. Photograph: EPALabour is prepared to vote down any Brexit deal Theresa May agrees with the European Union in an effort to send her back to negotiate a better one, party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said.Speaking in Liverpool at the start of his party’s annual conference, Mr Corbyn said any deal would have to satisfy the six tests Labour has set, one of which is that it should have the “exact same benefits” as membership of the single market and the customs union.“We would vote it down if it didn’t meet out tests, in order to send the government – if it is still in office – straight back to the negotiating table,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.The Labour leader’s warning comes as Theresa May is being pressurised by Conservative Brexiteers to formally abandon her Chequers proposal following last week’s Salzburg summit. Boris Johnson and David Davis, who resigned from the cabinet in protest against Chequers, will on Monday endorse a proposal for a Canada-style free trade agreement instead.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Jacob Rees-Mogg said the EU leaders’ treatment of Mrs May served as a reminder of why Britain voted to leave.“The EU is blind to have turned down the Chequers proposal – it offers Europe almost all it wants, but in its greed it asks for more. As proposed it would leave the UK a vassal state, chained to rules it could not alter and denied the liberty it voted for. That, in its overbearing arrogance, the EU has rejected this has saved the United Kingdom from a bad deal,” he wrote.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed reports that the prime minister was considering a snap election as “for the birds” and insisted the government is sticking with the Chequers proposals despite Salzburg.“We have come up with a serious set of proposals. We are not just going to flit from plan to plan like some sort of diplomatic butterfly. We are going to be resolute about this and really press the EU to treat us with some respect,” he said.Mr Raab said that Britain would hold its nerve and continue to negotiate “in good faith” but he said the EU would have to show more flexibility if a deal is to be agreed.“If we just get this sort of ‘computer says no’ response from the EU we are not going to make progress,” he said.Meanwhile, at the Labour Party conference party officials are working on a Brexit compromise after more than 100 local organisations submitted motions on the EU exit to Labour’s annual gathering, said deputy leader Tom Watson.Many called for a referendum on a orce deal reached with Brussels while others demanded another vote on the basic question of staying in or leaving the bloc.On a day when 5,000 people marched through Liverpool to call for Labour to back a second referendum, general secretary of Unite Len McCluskey added his voice to warnings about holding a second vote. He said a ballot should be on the deal, not EU membership. Some Labour voters have threatened to switch their support to ensure Brexit goes through, he added.“There are significant numbers of traditional Labour supporters who are saying we’re going to vote Conservative because we don’t trust Labour to take us out of the European Union,” Mr McCluskey told BBC Radio 5 Live. “We’re coming out of the European Union, for us to now enter some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again I think would be wrong.”Mr McCluskey’s remarks come on the back of a YouGov poll that indicated more than 86 per cent of Labour members want a second vote. Delegates will debate the issue on Tuesday. – Additional reporting BloombergDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Alex WongGetty Images The Capitol is covered in mud.Somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind, I can recall a time when the sight of that white dome thrilled me. As a teenager, working for a New York congressman, I felt privileged to walk the same marble corridors where some of America’s most revered leaders had walked.I can also vaguely remember a time, back before the travesty of Bush v Gore, when I felt awe walking past the Supreme Court. And if I try really hard, I can summon the lost sensation of pride in covering the White House. But all that is utterly changed.It was wrenching to watch the futile Iraq war unfold, with its tragic echoes of Vietnam. It is jarring to think I could live through three sagas of impeachment. But I most dread the rhyming history we are plunged into now: the merciless pummelling of a woman who dares to obstruct the glide path of a conservative Supreme Court nominee.It is unnerving to think how far women have come, only to find ourselves dragged back to the same place.It has been almost exactly 27 years since the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings, and we are still defensively explaining – including to the US’s troglodyte president – why women do not always tell the authorities about verbal and physical sexual assaults, why they bury episodes or try to manoeuvre past them.We are still watching a bookish university professor from the west, who tried to anonymously report an alleged blight on the character of a man about to ascend to a lifetime of power, get smeared as a demanding, mixed-up, uptight, loony fantasist.I didn’t sleep the week of the Hill-Thomas hearings. At first I was feverishly trying to figure out what was true in their two diametrically opposite stories.But it quickly became apparent that Thomas was lying.His friends and supporters had talked publicly about how, at Yale Law School, Thomas was a regular patron of X-rated movie houses and enjoyed describing the porn to friends afterward.But that was not introduced into testimony by either the Republicans or the Democrats. Instead, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch – who is still on the judiciary committee at age 84 for this new kangaroo court – suggested that a man as esteemed as Thomas could not possibly know the language of porn, that anyone who talked like that was “a psychopathic sex fiend or a pervert”.Hatch preposterously accused Hill of scavenging her testimony about Long Dong Silver from an old law case, and her story about Thomas asking “Who put pubic hair on my Coke?” from the novel The Exorcist.No one was trying to figure out the truth or do what was best for the court and the country. Republicans only cared about ramming through a right-wing justice. Even though they were the majority, Democrats were cowed by Thomas wrapping himself in the charged symbolism of the civil rights movement he had always scorned. And they were gun-shy after criticism of their initial bungling of Hill’s revelation. (Does that ring a bell?) Joe Biden, the committee chairman, cancelled the testimony of Hill’s backup witnesses from work.Teddy Kennedy was mute, hobbled by his own past sins. The feminists were less concerned with Hill’s humiliation than with using her as a bludgeon to block a justice who would be devastating on women’s rights.After a three-day FBI investigation, the White House declared Hill’s charges “unfounded”. Then agents were pressured by Republicans into providing affidavits suggesting that Hill had embellished her testimony, as Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson wrote in Strange Justice.Anita Hill was alone, in a hearing room full of Republican liars and Democratic cowards, getting ripped apart as “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty,” in the immortal words of Kavanaugh pal turned Hillary henchman David Brock and this in front of her elderly parents, farmers from Oklahoma.Post #MeToo, the Republicans know they have to be more careful on the surface. Their wet work to discredit Christine Blasey Ford will have to be outsourced and done mostly outside the hearing room consider the sordid, outrageous attempt by Ed Whelan – a friend of Brett Kavanaugh’s who heads a prominent conservative think tank on, ahem, ethics – to throw suspicion on a lookalike classmate at Georgetown Prep. Backed by the Swift Boat public relations slimers, as Politico reported, Whelan even tweeted a floor plan to the house the student grew up in.Dr Blasey is dealing with some demonic forces not in play with Prof Hill: a vicious partisan internet that drove her out of her house and being discredited not merely by the White House but personally by a president who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault, who has consistently defended predators such as Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly and Roy Moore, and who is advised by the same man who enabled Ailes’s loathsome behaviour at Fox News.We haven’t forgotten our history. But we still seem doomed to repeat it. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2017 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except the South West of England where Isla was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the second year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Lily replaced Poppy in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Leo replaced Thomas in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2016.The statistics, compiled by the ONS, are derived from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.Baby names | 10 most popular in 2017The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.Nick Stripe, Vital Statistics Outputs Branch, Office for National Statistics said: Although Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2017, some fascinating changes took place beneath them.Leo entered the boys’ top 10 for the first time, whilst Hunter rocketed into the top 100, also for the first time, reaching number 78.Sarah, the most popular name for baby girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since our records began in 1904. Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and HallieThere were only two new entries into the top 100 most popular boys’ names in 2017 for England and Wales: Hunter and Ralph replaced Aaron and Jasper, which were in the top 100 in 2016.There were six new entries in the top 100 most popular girls’ names in 2017 in England and Wales: Aurora, Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia.The influence of popular culture continues to seemingly provide inspiration for new parents.

People want justice and stability and we will ensure accountability, he added.Solih had the backing of a united opposition trying to oust Yameen but struggled for visibility with the electorate, with local media fearful of falling foul of heavy-handed decrees and reporting restrictions.Preliminary results released by two private media outlets placed Solih in the lead with 58.1 percent of the vote in the two man race, with around half of all ballots counted.The Mihaaru and Avas news websites said their tallies were based on official results published by ballot stations across the country.Yameen, who was widely tipped to retain power, has imprisoned or forced into exile almost all of his main rivals.The poll is being closely watched by regional rivals India and China, who are jostling to influence Indian Ocean nations. The European Union and United States, meanwhile, have threatened sanctions if the vote is not free and fair.Many voters across the Indian Ocean archipelago said they stood in line for over five hours to cast their ballots, while expatriate Malians voted in neighbouring Sri Lanka and India.Males election commission officials prepare ballot papers for counting votes at a polling station at the end of the presidential electionThe Elections Commission said balloting was extended by three hours until 7:00 pm (1400 GMT) because of technical glitches suffered by tablet computers containing electoral rolls, with officials using manual systems to verify voters\u0027 identities.An election official said the deadline was also extended due to heavy voter turnout.Eight hours \u0026amp counting.

a trend also experienced by dairy shops across the country.The supermarket revealed that the cakes, often made of Gouda, Stilton and Brie, have become increasingly popular among newlyweds, with sales of cheese wedding cakes up an average of 49 per cent compared to last year.Andy Swinscoe the owner of The Courtyard Dairy in Settle has been selling cheese wedding cakes there for five years.He said that the cheese cakes give a good alternative for people who want to avoid sugar, and for couples wanting their wedding to be unique.One of the cheese cakes on sale at The Courtyard DairyMr Swinscoe explained: A lot of people like the whole experience - they come to our shop and taste all the cheese and it\u0027s a real experience.A lot of people want to avoid sugar and also a lot of people do not like fruit cake.People even take cheese home from these weddings as party favours.It\u0027s something a bit different and a talking point.We\u0027ve been doing it for five years - popularity has massively increased in recent years.After a banquet of rich food, revelers often enjoy a slice of cheese with a glass of wine rather than a piece of dense cake, he added.Jo Carman, Waitrose Entertaining Buyer, added: “There’s no doubt that a slice of cheese to celebrate a marriage is gaining in popularity.Couples who want to avoid sugar opt for cheese \u0026#39cakes\u0026#39With Waitrose, the bride and groom can opt for a completely British wedding cheese cake, including a Hafod Welsh Organic Cheddar, a Cropwell Bishop Stilton and a Cornish Yarg. The cake is a beautiful balance of flavours and textures, and pairs wonderfully with dry cider or a crisp floral Riesling.”Waitrose magazine news editor Alison Hepworth said that she opted for one as a centrepiece at my thrifty nuptials.  She said that as well as being easy to decorate they double up as the evening meal served with bread or biscuits and a few chutneys and pickles.She added: The news came of little surprise to me: cheese wedding cakes make sense because they are practical and great value but also beautiful.Comment: Despite the calls for a second referendum, Labour\u0026#39s Brexit stance remains as clear as mudBodyguard draws to a nail-biting climax amid hopes that it will return for a second seriesRich on borrowed time, warns Jeremy Corbyn Bodyguard, episode 6 recap: from Nadia to that walk, all the twists from a finale that kept everyone guessingBodyguard finale, review: excruciatingly anxious scenes were let down by an average plotLabour split looms over Brexit as Jeremy Corbyn backs a second referendum\u0026#39Majority of Cabinet\u0026#39 now supports move towards Canada-style Brexit dealLabour adopted anti-Semitism rules to \u0026#39ease\u0026#39 Corbyn attacks, says Len McCluskeyThree children in every classroom suffering mental health problem fuelled by social media, Barnardos chief warnsComment: We must ditch Chequers or be condemned to a crazed Corbynista takeoverPut Brexit talks with EU on backburner and open negotiations with rest of world, Theresa May toldFour sharks killed after attack on swimmers near Great Barrier ReefConcert pianist with Tourette’s Syndrome has accused top orchestras of branding him \u0026#39trouble\u0026#39Schoolgirl with allergy suffers fatal reaction to Pret baguette\u0026#39We\u0026#39re being bugged!\u0026#39 Anti-Chequers deal Brexiteers fear security services are monitoring calls and meetingsJeremy Corbyn accused of playing the \u0026#39victim\u0026#39 in Labour’s anti-Semitism row after appearing to backtrack on apologies to Jewish communityJoanna Lumley claims her famous Avengers photo was an example of sexist \u0026#39upskirting\u0026#39Russia blames \u0026#39misleading\u0026#39 Israeli intelligence for downed plane in Syria Mike Pompeo warns White House staff as he denies Rosenstein wiretapping allegationsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/09/rupert-murdoch.jpg","title":"rupert murdoch sky takeover auction comcast 21st century fox","story":"Created with Sketch.The media tycoon\u0027s first swoop for Sky in 2011 was derailed by the phone hacking scandalClick to followThe IndependentRupert Murdoch\u0027s company had valued Sky at £18bn back in 2016Rupert Murdoch has failed to gain full control of Sky after Comcast beat Fox with a £30bn bid for the broadcaster.The US telecommunications giant won out in a day-long auction overseen by Britain\u0027s Takeover Panel on Saturday.After the maximum three rounds of bidding, Comcast\u0026nbspoffered £17.28 per share compared to 21st\u0026nbspCentury Fox\u0027s £15.67 per share for the 61 per cent of the company it does not already own.Comcast owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US.Rupert Murdoch\u0027s News Corp reports global net loss of $1.4bnRupert Murdoch given government clearance for Sky takeoverMurdoch takeover of Sky \u0027not in the public interest\u0027, watchdog findsWith the Sky takeover, Comcast will become the biggest pay TV provider in the world, with around 52 million customers after adding Sky\u0027s 23 million subscribers.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: This is a great day for Comcast.Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team.This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.We couldn\u0027t be more excited by the opportunities in front of us.

But they come at a cost, and one that is not easy to swallow.And from Friday the Xs and Xs Max have gone on sale in the UK and around the world, meaning UK networks are battling to offer customers the best deals on the new iPhones.(The iPhone Xr, which might offer considerably better value for money, is not going to be released until October. It might be well worth waiting for: it has many of the same features as the Xs, but starts at £749 rather than £999.)Here are the various ways to buy an iPhone Xs now.Buying a phone is not necessarily the cheapest way of buying an iPhone, and it requires you to have the most amount of money to hand. But the flip side is that you get everything sorted out in one go, you won\u0027t have payments hanging over your head, and you\u0027re free to do what you want with the phone.iPhone XS launch in September 2018111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/11/aran-islands-cart-1950s-ireland.jpg","title":"travel ireland aran islands visit travel accommodation to do remote","story":"Created with Sketch.At the end of the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, playwright JM Synge\u0026nbspescaped to the\u0026nbspstripped back and simple life on\u0026nbspInishmore, Inishmaan\u0026nbspand Inisheer. Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/09/rupert-murdoch.jpg","title":"rupert murdoch sky takeover auction comcast 21st century fox","story":"Created with Sketch.The media tycoon\u0027s first swoop for Sky in 2011 was derailed by the phone hacking scandalClick to followThe IndependentRupert Murdoch\u0027s company had valued Sky at £18bn back in 2016Rupert Murdoch has failed to gain full control of Sky after Comcast beat Fox with a £30bn bid for the broadcaster.The US telecommunications giant won out in a day-long auction overseen by Britain\u0027s Takeover Panel on Saturday.After the maximum three rounds of bidding, Comcast\u0026nbspoffered £17.28 per share compared to 21st\u0026nbspCentury Fox\u0027s £15.67 per share for the 61 per cent of the company it does not already own.Comcast owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US.Rupert Murdoch\u0027s News Corp reports global net loss of $1.4bnRupert Murdoch given government clearance for Sky takeoverMurdoch takeover of Sky \u0027not in the public interest\u0027, watchdog findsWith the Sky takeover, Comcast will become the biggest pay TV provider in the world, with around 52 million customers after adding Sky\u0027s 23 million subscribers.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: This is a great day for Comcast.Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team.This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.We couldn\u0027t be more excited by the opportunities in front of us.

after summer heatwave, experts warnWater companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.Despite recent rainfall, they warned that parts of the north of England are under particular strain as reservoirs around Manchester, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent are very low.The current environmental situation is still fragile, and higher-than-average rainfall throughout autumn and winter will be necessary to avert spring water shortages.If rainfall is below average, water restrictions for the British public will be likely in early 2019.Historic sites across UK exposed by

James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, chaired the NDG meeting and said that early action and planning would be necessary to avert this situation.“Ensuring sufficient water for the public, the economy and the environment is one of biggest challenges we face as a country,” he said.“The Environment Agency will continue to work actively with the water companies and other water users to seek to ensure that.”Dry conditions over the summer were linked to\u0026nbspdevastating fires around Oldham and Bolton, and caused\u0026nbspdisruption to British wildlife including hedgehogs, birds and frogs.The Environment Agency responded to more than 300 dry-weather related incidents over the past few months, more than three times the usual number for the summer.Farmers accused the government of taking “little action” after environment\u0026nbspsecretary Michael Gove pledged to help them recover from the challenging summer conditions.Recent efforts to save water combined with spells of rain have helped the sector recover, but for some crops and species the\u0026nbspfull effects of the summer are yet to be seen.Water companies say they are implementing measures such as reducing leaks and identifying new water sources to prepare for next year.“But this is not just a matter for the organisations at National Drought Group,” said Sir James.“We all use water, and everyone has a role to play in ensuring we continue to have reliable access to it, so we encourage everyone to please use water wisely.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your

We very rarely have referendums in this country, the people have decided against my wishes and my union’s wishes, but they have decided.“So if the parliamentarians, if spineless Tory MPs, lose the courage of their convictions and won’t vote against whatever deal comes back, then my union and Labour’s policy at the moment is to say, ‘Well, if you are incapable of carrying out your functions in parliament, we should take the deal back to the people.”For us now to enter into some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again, I think would be wrongA YouGov poll commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign showed nearly 90 per cent of Labour Party members want another referendum, three-quarters would like to see a commitment in Labour’s manifesto – but critically, it shows that 93 per cent would vote to stay in the EU if they were given a chance.But Mr McCluskey said: “There are significant numbers of traditional Labour supporters who are saying, ‘We’re going to vote Conservative because we don’t trust Labour to take us out of the European Union’, despite the fact that Jeremy has said repeatedly ‘of course, we recognise the result, of course we respect the result, we are coming out of the European Union’.“For us now to enter into some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again, I think would be wrong.”Spelling out how he sees a new referendum playing out, he said the question must be narrowly confined to approval of any deal Ms May brings back from Brussels.Jeremy Corbyn has shifted significantly towards a new referendumCorbyn told Marr he is an \u0027antiracist\u0027, but he\u0027s not that good at itWorkers to make up one third of company board members under LabourCorbyn will back new Brexit referendum if Labour conference wants it Jeremy Corbyn will face an open goal if he backs a second referendumHe went on: “If the people vote against the deal then we are back to the other scenario. She has to resign, there has to be general election so that we have a new government.“And if that government is a Corbyn government, not only will we come out of the European Union but we will come out of it with a deal that will unite the whole nation.”Mr Corbyn said over the weekend that he would try to use Tory Brexit rebels to force the prime minister into an early election, possibly by November.To do this Mr Corbyn’s MPs and Tories from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group of Brexiteers would vote together against Ms May’s Chequers plan.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote

it was released on Friday.Activists are using it to share information and views, but also to set up campaign activity and – critically – to organise themselves ahead of the crucial vote on Labour’s stance on a People’s Vote on Tuesday.The Independent\u0026nbsphas launched its\u0026nbspFinal Say\u0026nbspcampaign for a People’s Vote on whatever the outcome of Brexit is, with more than 820,000 people having signed its petition so far.One person involved in setting up the new app, told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “This is the go to place if you think the party needs to come out for a People’s Vote.“It brings people together for what’s going to be the fight of our generation.”\u0026nbspIt comes as those in the\u0026nbspsenior echelons of Labour seek to finesse the motion that will be voted on to give caveated support to a new referendum, with Unite boss Len McCluskey\u0026nbspsaying on Sunday that any vote must not include an option to stay in the EU.McCluskey says second EU referendum should not inclide remain optionOn Saturday night Mr Corbyn said he would not “walk away” if conference\u0026nbspvoted for a motion calling on the party to back a new referendum. But some backing a final\u0026nbspsay are concerned that the motion voted on will only offer vague approval for a new vote.Then on Sunday, Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said: “The referendum shouldn’t be on, ‘do you want to go back in the European Union’.“The people have already decided on that. We very rarely have referendums in this country, the people have decided against my wishes and my union’s wishes, but they have decided.“So if the parliamentarians, if spineless Tory MPs, lose the courage of their convictions and won’t vote against whatever deal comes back, then my union and Labour’s policy at the moment is to say, ‘well, if you are incapable of carrying out your functions in parliament, we should take the deal back to the people.”A YouGov poll commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign showed nearly 90 per cent of Labour Party members want another referendum, three-quarters would like to see a commitment in Labour’s manifesto – but critically, it shows that 93 per cent would vote to stay in the EU if they were given a chance.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/08/rtr1l4a9.jpg","title":"labour private tenants renters unions conference jeremy corbyn jon healey","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Party says it will\u0026nbspgive renters new rights to control rental costs, improve conditions and increase securityClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour says the funds will support more than 11 million peopleLabour has pledged to plough £20m into setting up renters’ unions, with the aim of offering support to millions of private tenants across England.The commitment, which will form part of Labour’s next blueprint for government, aims to build on similar organisations in Germany, where renters’ unions are commonplace.\u0026nbspIt comes after the party announced it would also introduce a levy on tens of thousands of second homes and use the money to combat rising levels of homelessness.\u0026nbspLabour pledges to fund alcohol care specialists in NHS hospitalsCorbyn indicates shift in Brexit stance towards final say voteBacking Remain would risk abandoning Labour’s working-class votersThousands rally to demand Labour supports second Brexit voteLabour antisemitism row could cost party the next election, MP warnsWorkers to make up one third of company board members under LabourThe £20m fund made available by Labour will be staggered over a three-year period and help towards start-up costs, with organisations eligible to to bid for the cash to set up or grow independent renters’ unions.\u0026nbspIt is hoped the new organisations will become self-funding through members’ subscription fees and provide advice, advocacy and representation on behalf of the 11.5 million people in the private rental market.The move would ensure that renters have collective bodies to mirror organisations such as the National Landlords Association,\u0026nbspwhich lobbies the government on behalf of its 30,000 private residential landlords.\u0026nbsp“Tenants who rent from private landlords have been hit hard by the housing crisis,” said Labour’s shadow housing secretary Jon Healey.\u0026nbspHe added: “Labour’s new commitment is clear: we’ll give renters new rights to control rental costs, improve conditions and increase security. Renters’ unions help put power in the hands of tenants.\u0026nbsp“And the next Labour government will fund set-up costs for these unions across the country to support renters to defend their rights, and make the housing market fairer.”\u0026nbspIn a recent paper, left-wing think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research recommended the creation of a nationwide renters’ union and said England could learn lesson from Germany in terms of tenancy security, controls on cost, and tenant representation.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has stated that he will support a second referendum on Brexit if the Labour membership votes for one at this week\u0027s party conference.

Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg","title":"china uighurs human rights muslims orphanages xinjiang province reeducation","story":"Created with Sketch.‘It’s like my kids are in jail,’\u0026nbspsays 29-year-old mother living in exileStaff and agenciesClick to followThe IndependentChina is putting Uighur children in \u0027orphanages\u0027 even if their parents are aliveChinese authorities are putting the children of Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups into dozens of state-run orphanages across the western Xinjiang region even if their parents are not dead, as some 1 million adults in their families are sent to internment camps.The orphanages are the most recent manifestation of Beijing’s efforts to systematically distance young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture. Uighurs fear such efforts are erasing their ethnic identity, one child at a time.\u0026nbspIn Istanbul,\u0026nbspa dozen Uighur families spoke to reporters during the Muslim holy festival Eid al-Adha, which comes with large family reunions. Tables in every home were resplendent with traditional Xinjiang dishes like homemade noodles, freshly butchered lamb and crispy naan.\u0026nbspBut the Uighurs who fled China to avoid detention described the\u0026nbsppainful absence of the children they left behind – who they believe are now in the hands of the very government tearing their families apart.\u0026nbspSome did not want their full names used for fear of retribution against relatives still in Xinjiang.Every morning, Meripet wakes up to her nightmare: the Chinese government has turned four of her children into orphans, even though she and their father are alive.\u0026nbspMeripet and her husband left the kids with their grandmother at home in China when they went to nurse Meripet’s sick father in Turkey. But after Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, that\u0026nbspvisit became exile.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspher mother-in-law was also taken prisoner, and Meripet learned from a friend that her offspring, aged between three and eight,\u0026nbsphad been placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region\u0026nbspunder the care of the state that broke up her family.\u0026nbsp“It’s like my kids are in jail,” Meripet said, her voice cracking. “My four children are separated from me and living like orphans.”\u0026nbspMeripet’s family is among tens of thousands swept up by President Xi Jinping‘s campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities that has alarmed a United Nations panel and the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The UK Foreign Office also believes Beijing has “introduced intrusive security and surveillance measures and cultural restrictions” aimed at the Uighur people, including “re-education camps”.Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.\u0026nbspThe institutions are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture,\u0026nbspinterviews with more than a dozen people and a review of procurement documents suggest. The government has been building thousands of so-called “bilingual” schools, where minority children are taught in Mandarin and penalised for speaking in their native tongues. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory for children and, in one Kazakh family’s case, start from the age of five.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs fear that these measures are essentially wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in the US, Canada and Australia treated indigenous children – policies that have left generations traumatised.\u0026nbsp“This is an ethnic group whose knowledge base is being erased,” said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. “What we’re looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost.”\u0026nbspFor Meripet, the loss is agony it is the absence of her children and the knowledge they are in state custody. A year and a half after leaving home, the 29-year-old mother looked at a photo of a brightly painted building surrounded by barbed wire where her children are believed to be held. She fell silent. And then she wept.\u0026nbsp“When I finally see them again, will they even recognise me?” she asked. “Will I recognise them?”\u0026nbspWhen Mr Xi came to power in 2012, an early challenge to his rule was a surge in violent attacks that killed several hundred people and which Beijing pinned on Uighur separatists. Since then, he\u0026nbsphas overseen the most extensive effort in recent years to quell Xinjiang, appointing in 2016 the former Tibet party boss Chen Quanguo to lead the troubled region bordering Afghanistan.\u0026nbspChen rolled out unprecedented security measures such as the internment camps that hold Muslims without trial and force them to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. China has described religious extremism as an illness that needs to be cured through what it calls “transformation through education”. Former detainees say one can be thrown into a camp for praying regularly, reading the Quran, going abroad or even speaking to someone overseas.\u0026nbspThe camps are among the most troubling aspects of Mr Xi’s campaign to assert the party’s dominance over all aspects of Chinese life, which has drawn comparisons with Mao Zedong. Authorities heeding Mr Xi’s call to “Sinicise” religion across the country have shut underground churches, burnt\u0026nbspBibles, replaced pictures of Jesus with ones of the president, and toppled crescents from mosques. The party also has beefed up its ability to track the movements of its 1.4 billion people, with Xinjiang serving as an important testing ground.\u0026nbspIn Xinjiang, detention has left countless children without their parents. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, reporters interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China.\u0026nbspThe families say that among these children, 14 are known to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown because most of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained.\u0026nbspSome interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Others insisted their full names be used despite the risks, saying they were desperate for their stories to be heard. They pleaded with reporters to track down their families in Xinjiang, and one interviewee pressed a piece of paper into a reporter’s hand with a Chinese address scribbled on it.\u0026nbspThe regional government appears to be moving quickly to build centres to house the children of these exiles and of detainees. A review of procurement notices in Xinjiang has found that since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30m\u0026nbsp(200 million Chinese yuan, £22.7m) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, known variously as “welfare centres” and “protection centres”, with enough beds to house about 5,000 children.\u0026nbspIn July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine centres for the “protection of disadvantaged children” in the Xinjiang city of Hotan and several counties in Kashgar, Aksu and Kizilsu prefectures, inhabited primarily by ethnic minority groups. Most orphanages have a minimum of 100 beds mandated by the government, and some are much larger. One notice called for an orphanage in Moyu county with four four-story dormitories, coming to 22,776 sq\u0026nbspmetres in size – bigger than three\u0026nbspfootball pitches.\u0026nbspThese numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are being housed. It’s impossible to tell how many children of detainees end up at these schools because they also serve other children.\u0026nbspShi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, said that “authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they’re the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents”. But such services may not be welcome. A government report from Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in June last year acknowledged that relatives were resistant to “handing over” their extended families’ kids to the orphanages because they “lack trust or confidence” in the centres.\u0026nbspA friend told Meripet last November her four children were living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten in southern Xinjiang. The friend said Meripet’s sister-in-law had visited her children and was permitted to take them home for one night only.\u0026nbspThe school looks like a house-sized castle, with a bright marigold facade, orange turrets and blue rooftops. Its entrance is blocked by an iron gate and a walled enclosure lined with barbed wire. “We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland”, say the red characters emblazoned on one fence.\u0026nbspThe principal, who gave only her last name, Ai, told reporters that the institution was “just a normal kindergarten”. But the authorities’ anxiety was clear: armed police officers surrounded the reporters’ car minutes after their arrival at the school and ordered them to delete any photos.\u0026nbspGu Li, a propaganda official for Hotan who also immediately appeared on the scene, added: “There are really young kids here – some of them may even be orphans whose parents have died.”\u0026nbspHotan City Kindness Kindergarten (AP)A report published this February in the Xinjiang Daily, a party newspaper, called Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten a “free, full-time” kindergarten for children aged six and younger that provides accommodations and clothing to those whose “parents cannot care for them for a variety of reasons”.\u0026nbsp“Soon after many of the kids arrived at the school, they grew taller and got fatter, and quickly started using Mandarin to communicate,” the article said. Another state media report in January said $1.24m had been invested in the kindergarten.\u0026nbspSatellite imagery shows that the kindergarten had been constructed less than three years ago, just as an initiative was launched to strengthen “bilingual” education in Xinjiang. More than 4,300 bilingual kindergartens were built or renovated last year, according to the government. A report on the project in a state-run regional newspaper said such kindergartens taught children “civilised living habits”.\u0026nbsp“The children started educating their parents: your hands are too dirty, your clothes are too dirty, you haven’t brushed your teeth,” the report quoted Achilem Abduwayit, a deputy chief of the Hotan city education bureau, as saying.\u0026nbspLife in an orphanage could have a lasting psychological and cultural impact on children, said James Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.\u0026nbsp“You grow up as a ward of the state,” he said. “They’re told to be patriotic citizens, told that the identity and religion of their parents was abnormal, if not radical, and thus needs to be eradicated.”\u0026nbspMeripet has at least an inkling of where her children are. Her brother, a 37-year-old doctor named Aziz, has not heard any news of his three youngest children since his wife was taken to a re-education centre in June 2017.\u0026nbspAziz fled to Turkey more than a year ago after he received a call from his local police station ordering him to report to authorities immediately. More than half his neighbours had already been taken away to re-education centres or prison, he said.\u0026nbspNow the young doctor is often shaken awake by a nightmare in which his kids are huddling at the bottom of a cliff, their faces smudged with dirt, calling to him to hoist them up. Aziz walks for what feels like hours but cannot reach them. He awakens with their cries ringing in his ears.\u0026nbsp“If I could, I would choose not to have been born as a Uighur, to not have been born in Xinjiang,” Aziz said. “We are the most unfortunate ethnic group in the world.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA boat has capsized killing at 136 people in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.

The election was the first since Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup last year, and featured a close race between Mnangagwa and opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC Alliance). Deadly clashes broke out earlier in the week following the release of parliamentary election results, amid allegations of fraud by Chamisa and MDC supportersThe Chinese government says all 2.9 million students attending compulsory elementary and junior high school in Xinjiang will receive Mandarin instruction by this month, up from just 39 per cent in 2016.\u0026nbspEven preschoolers are steeped in the language. A former teacher at a “bilingual” kindergarten outside Kashgar said all lessons were given in Mandarin and the entirely Uighur student body was banned from speaking Uighur at school. A colleague who used Uighur to explain concepts to students was fired, according to the teacher, who lives in Turkey but asked for anonymity because she fears retribution against family in China.\u0026nbspLike all schools in China, this one immersed children in patriotic education. Kindergarten textbooks were filled with songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China”, the teacher said.\u0026nbspDilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, said officials regularly visited her children’s kindergarten in Kashgar and asked the students if their parents read religious verses at home or participated in other faith-based activities. The questions effectively forced children to spy on their own families. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she said.\u0026nbspHer seven-year-old daughter once complained that her throat was sore from chanting party slogans. “Mama, what does it mean to love the motherland?” she asked.\u0026nbspSome bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Xinjiang has long provided voluntary boarding school programmes that are seen as coveted opportunities for the best minority students. But several Uighurs asserted that in many cases boarding school was now mandatory for minority children, even though Han Chinese children could choose to continue living at home.\u0026nbspThe Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government has said the tuition-free boarding schools relieve parents of education and living expenses and help raise Mandarin standards, which will make their children more employable.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs say they do not want their culture erased.\u0026nbspGulzar Seley, who was detained in China along with her newborn son, is placed on a table in the home of her husband Halmurat Idris in Istanbul (AP)“If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I’m afraid they won’t be like us anymore,” said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang.\u0026nbspAdil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then five-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Monday\u0026nbspthrough Friday instead. The father called the policy a “terrifying” step towards extinguishing Kazakh culture.\u0026nbspA Uighur businessman in Istanbul, also named Adil, told a similar story. Adil’s son was nine\u0026nbspyears old when the school system automatically transferred him to a boarding school. All children of a certain age in their Uighur district were obliged to attend boarding school, Adil said. His son was only permitted to come home on weekends and holidays.\u0026nbsp“There were iron bars like we saw in a zoo in Kashgar,” Adil recalled.\u0026nbspDilnur said her neighbours too were only allowed to visit their kids at boarding school on Wednesday nights, and even then they had to hand them sweets through a fence.\u0026nbsp“The educational goals are secondary to the political goals,” said Timothy Grose, a professor at Indiana’s Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who has done research on Xinjiang boarding schools. “They aim to dissolve loyalties to ethnic identity ... toward a national identity.”\u0026nbspA government notice posted in February in Kashgar states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately – even if one parent is still at home. Students must be instilled with socialist values, the notice said, and be taught to “be grateful for education and love and repay the motherland”, and avoid the “75 types of behaviour that show religious extremism”. Such behaviour ranges from calling for “holy war” to growing beards and quitting smoking and drinking for religious reasons, the government says.\u0026nbspChina insists it guarantees\u0026nbspfreedom of religion, but Uighurs view the Chinese education system as a threat to it. In schools, children are taught to respect teachers more than their parents and may begin to criticise their parents’ Islamic faith, according to Byler.\u0026nbsp“The students, children, might question them and say, you know, this is backward, this is extremist,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Kashgar notice also said schools being modified to house students should place no more than 24 beds in one room – an indication of the programme’s size. In 2015, a sprawling new boarding school complex was completed on the outskirts of Kashgar, with the capacity to house 23,400 students and teachers, according to the state-run China Daily.\u0026nbspAbdurehim Imin, a writer from Kashgar, said a friend told him his 14-year-old daughter had been sent to a bilingual school in 2015 after his wife was arrested, ostensibly for receiving a gift of olive oil he sent her. When reporters visited what appeared to be his daughter’s school, Peyzawat County No 4 High School, a local plainclothes officer who identified herself as Gu Li said it was a bilingual boarding school. She said that while Uighur students had to study Mandarin, there were also Han Chinese students studying Uighur.\u0026nbspYet the exterior of the school bore bright red lettering that said: “Please speak Mandarin upon entering the schoolyard”. Barbed wire around the campus extended for miles, with rows of tall apartment buildings marked as dormitories.\u0026nbspA historian at the University of Sydney, David Brophy, said the move towards boarding schools brought to mind Aboriginal children in Australia who were forcibly separated from their families in the 1900s and placed into state-run institutions that discouraged indigenous identity.\u0026nbsp“Should China’s policies continue in this direction, we may be talking about a Chinese version of the Stolen Generation,” he said.Since coming to Istanbul by himself in 2014, 42-year-old Imin, the writer, has led a solitary existence in a dimly lit apartment with bare walls and stacks of writings. For the first year, he avoided looking at photos of his children.\u0026nbsp“We are dying every day,” Imin said. “We cannot see our kids, we cannot see our parents. This is an eternal torture.”\u0026nbspIn December, he was sent a photo of his daughter wearing a traditional Chinese “qipao”. He deleted the picture because he could not bear to look at it, he said, and could not sleep for nearly a month.\u0026nbspImin also has four other children in Xinjiang. Last summer, a friend who had visited his home in Kashgar told Imin that two of them had been killed in a traffic accident while his wife was in prison. He does not know where the other two are.\u0026nbspFeeling helpless, he wrote verse after verse in mourning:\u0026nbsp“I will go... to tear down your dark, endless night ...\u0026nbspI will go, to embrace again my hometown ...\u0026nbspI will go, bearing my sorrow to your tomb.”\u0026nbspElsewhere in Istanbul, Meripet’s house was quiet during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holy festival heralded by large family reunions. In a room at the end of the hall, there rose the distant laughter of relatives’ children.\u0026nbspShe flipped through the photographs she keeps in her purse: Abdurahman, the oldest Adile, her only daughter and her two younger sons, Muhemmed and Abdulla. Meripet has a fifth child, a son named Abduweli who was born in Turkey. She calls him “my only light”.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes I wonder if I will go crazy from this pain,” she says. “I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope – I know one day I will see my children again.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/secondary/bono-brexit-populism-1519936.jpg","title":"Brexit latest bono populism andrew neil european populism EU brexit paradise papers","story":"Demanding we all seek the same \u0026ldquouplifting, positive vision of he EU he told the with the Washington Post: \u0026ldquoEurope needs to go from being seen as a bore, a bureaucracy, a technical project, to being what it is a grand, inspiring idea.The pro-EU veteran rocker has been using his fame to subject Britons to his options on the bloc by unfurling a giant EU flag at his concerts - whether fans voted for Brexit or not.Desperate to have his say in European politics, he has even penned his own articles in an array of newspapers from Brussels\u0026rsquo member states, including a piece in German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine that read that \u0026ldquoEurope is a thought that needs to become a feeling.On the subject of populism, he told the US publication: \u0026ldquoI love our differences, our dialects, our traditions, our peculiarities.\u0026lsquoVoiceless Bono left waving EU flag!\u0026rsquo U2 star mocked as gig cancelledBrigitte Macron wears slinky blue mini dress to meet U2\u0026rsquos Bono The pro-EU veteran rocker has been using his fame to subject Britons to his options on the bloc (Image: )This prompted a flurry of other replies from Mr Neil\u0026rsquos thousands of followers (Image: TWITTER)                BREXIT BOMBSHELL: May\u0027s NOT kidding EU - Army of 7,000 civil servants\u0026ldquoAnd I believe they still leave room for what Churchill called an \u0026lsquoenlarged patriotism\u0026rsquo plural allegiances, layered identities, to be Irish and European, German and European, not eitheror.He added: \u0026ldquoThe word patriotism has been stolen from us by nationalists and extremists who demand uniformity.

One chap has already offered to pay US$2,000 for one.\u0026ldquoOur funding comes to an end at the end of November 2019 and what we really need is more mainstream support. All it takes is around \u0026pound150,000 to \u0026pound200,00 to run these project effectively.\u0026ldquoAt the moment we have 400 people in our books, many of them elderly who suffer from loneliness, or illnesses or all manner of things and by attending our projects at the Annexe are finding a new purpose in life.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out?

If so, Donald ought to get himself to a doctor.Or maybe it’s that one with a thin stalk and a big yellow head the size of a dinner plate.If so, Stormy had better get herself to a doctor.A “RELATIONSHIP expert” has warned us all about dodgy body language  we’re out on a date.Tracey Cox says we shouldn’t fidget, for a start.

When they bring the black pepper, don’t sneeze on her pasta.4. If you do sneeze on her pasta, stir it around a bit when she’s not looking.5. Don’t use a bread stick to excavate the contents of your ear.6. Don’t keep checking the football scores on your phone. And shouting loudly: “Lee Gregory! 85th minute! Get IN you f***er!”7. Don’t ask the lady at the next table  she’s up for a threesome.Follow that stuff and you can fidget away to your heart’s delight. You’ll be OK.THERE’S a crisis in our wildle. Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday.

But it’s still way short — and the Government’s remedies are woefully timid.Sajid Javid promised a huge shake-up when he ran housing.

Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.FROM child abuse images to terrorism, Facebook is a platform for evil it seems unable or unwilling to prevent.Now it is hosting ads for people- smuggling gangs luring children to their doom in the Mediterranean.A new low, even for a tech giant with apparently no moral compass.Since Facebook now admits it is a publisher, why isn’t it regulated as one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This lot are more Bugsy Malone than Al Capone.Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic European Union showed their true colours.This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.But even before the Prime Minister had been the subject of calculated attempts to humiliate her, we saw just how detached from reality Europe’s leaders have become.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.This isn’t based on the half-baked “democratic” argument clung to by never-were and past-it grandees at home, such as Andrew Adonis and Lord Heseltine.They just want us to be given the chance to vote the “right” way.

He sets the timetable and makes decisions over which engines should be scrapped. The problem with today’s railway ­system is that there is nobody who takes on the role.That was made clear in the report by Professor Stephen Glaister, the chairman of the Office Of Rail And Road, into the chaos that paralysed the railways in May following an extensive timetable change.In a logical world, you might think, dear rail passenger, that Chris Grayling, the Secretary Of State For Transport, is the man in charge. After all, he is the one who pops up on TV when there is good news to announce, such as the opening of a refurbished ­station or the introduction of new trains, but you would be wrong.Grayling refuses to take responsibility, recently telling a Parliamentary committee that “I don’t run the railways”. Yet his civil servants in the Department interfere with the railways all the time. They make decisions over what ­services should be run, the fares to be charged, what new trains should be bought and which private company should operate them.Prof Glaister’s report makes clear that Grayling was deeply involved in making the decision to go ahead with the timetable changes, even though the ­industry was not prepared for them. If Grayling was not in charge, then he should have made sure that someone else was — but failed to do so.It’s clear from the report no one has overall responsibility for the ­railways, and that’s why they are in such a mess.Prof Glaister’s report highlights the fact that the railways were simply not ready to cope with the wholesale ­timetable changes, which were focused around ­services through London on the Thameslink lines and across the North, and ­overall affected nearly half — 46 per cent — of trains on the whole network.The report shows that the railway ­simply could not cope. The changes brought the service to its knees, resulting in thousands of services being ­cancelled and countless others delayed. Many passengers in May were left standing at stations for hours as ­successive trains failed to turn up.On one branch line in the Lake District, services were cancelled entirely and temporarily replaced by a diesel-hauled heritage train — which proved to be more popular than the usual service, especially as it was free.The introduction of the timetable resulted in the worst performance of the railways in more than a decade, with one in eight trains running late during this period. The after-effects are still being felt today, with daily cancellations and delays, and it will be several months before things are back to normal.Prof Glaister does not mince his words and found every part of the industry wanting. Network Rail, which is responsible for drawing up the timetable, “did not take any action” back in the autumn when it was clear there would be trouble ­implementing the new schedules.Two train operators, Govia Thameslink and Northern, “were not sufficiently aware” of the problems and failed to inform passengers when disruption ­occurred, while the Department For Transport and the Office Of Rail And Road itself watched these events unfold without doing anything or questioning whether the introduction of the timetable should be postponed.The irony is that the timetable changes were introduced to increase the number of trains available to commuters. In ­particular, in the North, the opening of the new Ordsall Chord linking ­Manchester’s two main railway stations was designed to improve services in the region.However, because Network Rail failed to ensure that more platforms were built at the biggest station, Piccadilly, rather than improvements for local passengers the result has been longer delays and ­numerous cancellations.That is precisely the sort of lack of co-ordination which happens because ­British Rail was broken up on its privatisation in the 1990s into more than 100 companies. Passengers are paying the price for that mistake today.The biggest error was to separate the services, run by companies including ­Virgin and Arriva, from the infrastructure, which is in the hands of Network Rail , when, in fact, the railways run much better as a single entity.Ironically, the Prime Minister at the time, John Major, had wanted the railway to be sold off as just four or five large companies that ran services and were responsible for the tracks and stations, but he was overruled by the Treasury, which wanted competition between ­companies — something that has simply not happened.As a result of the timetable chaos and other recent problems on the railways, such as the failure of the East Coast franchise and overspending on ­electrication schemes by Network Rail, Grayling has launched an inquiry into the state of the railways. It is the fourth such inquiry in the past decade and the others have largely been ignored.This time there is an obvious and clear solution. Create an organisation ­independent of the duffers in Whitehall who keep on interfering with the railways, and make sure it is headed by a Fat ­Controller who has power to make ­decisions over the whole railway, ­including the timetable, investment plans and ­services.Inevitably, this will at first have to be a publicly-owned body, since Network Rail is currently owned by the Government.But to appease any Tories opposed to renationalisation, Grayling could say that eventually it might be privatised — though given the experience of the crisis-ridden past 20 years, that day may well be a long time off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the best speech of her le.

We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boycott her.”Corbyn supporter Lynn Braben added: “Maureen Lipman shouldn’t be allowed to be in Corrie.“The right to be political isn’t the issue but she is alienating viewers who support Mr Corbyn by basically calling them Holocaust supporters.”And Daphne Miles said: “She used to be one of my favourite actors, until she started being routinely abusive about Corbyn.”Polling by YouGov which was released today suggests Labour could miss out on 900,000 votes in the wake of the party’s anti-Semitism crisis.That is larger than the margin of victory which the Tories secured in last year’s General Election.Euan Philipps of Labour Against Anti-Semitism told the Sunday Times: “This poll delivers a damning judgment on a Labour leader who has lost the moral authority to lead.“Jeremy Corbyn’s foolish and misguided decision to spend an entire summer baiting the British Jewish community appears to have backfired drastically, and turned thousands of vital swing voters away from the Labour party.”A separate poll, carried out by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, shows 40 per cent of British Jews have considered emigrating - up from 31 per cent in just a year.And 90 per cent of those asked said they believe Labour is harbouring anti-Semites."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436216051-e1537698153522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kalta volcano iceland to erupt in explosion 2010 cloud","story":"Katla, a “highly hazardous” volcano in Iceland, is showing tell-tale signs it could be about to blow its top, according to researchers.Icelandic and British volcanologists have detected Katla— Icelandic for “kettle” or “boiler” — is emitting carbon dioxide on a huge scale which suggests magma chambers are filling up fast.According to the Sunday Times, the scientists believe it could be an indicator that an eruption could be brewing which would overshadow the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in 2010.This saw a vast choking veil of boiling-hot ash drt into the worlds busiest airspace, effectively grounding all European air travel.A research report recently published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that Katla was releasing between 12 and 24 kilotons of carbon dioxide every day.Only two other volcanoes in the world are known to be generating more at the moment. In the journal, the team wrote: “Through high-precision airborne measurements and atmospheric dispersion modelling, we show that Katla, a highly hazardous subglacial volcano which last erupted 100 years ago, is one of the largest volcanic sources of CO2 on Earth, releasing up to five per cent of total global volcanic emissions.”Sarah Barsotti, co-ordinator for volcanic hazards at the Icelandic Meteorological Office, said: “There is no way of telling when it will erupt, just that it will.”Just north of Hekla, scientists have long been keeping their eyes on Katla.Katlas last eruption was 99 years ago in 1918 – the longest it’s been dormant since the 1100s.Of its past ten eruptions, eight took place between September and November - when its thought glacial melting creates the necessary conditions for magma to burst forth.It is this glacial ice – hundreds of metres thick – that most worries locals.Should such an explosion happen, the ice covering the volcano will melt, flooding the surrounding areas so severely that authorities have plans in place to evacuate Iceland’s entire southern coast.Evgenia Ilyinskaya, a research fellow in the Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics at Leeds University, told RUV, the Icelandic national broadcasting service, that the volume of CO2 indicated something signicant.She said: “There must also be a magma build-up to release this quantity of gas.“It is well known from other volcanoes, for example in Hawaii and Alaska, that CO2 emissions increase weeks or years ahead of eruptions. “This is a clear sign we need to keep a close eye on Katla. She isn’t just doing nothing, and these findings confirm that there is something going on.”Ilyinskaya and her team did sound a not of caution that more studies were needed to confirm whether the amount of magma was increasing over time. But another volcanologist, Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, professor of geophysics at the University of Iceland, was more skeptical about the eruption fears.The prof argued more research was needed to say whether the emissions were growing or they were normal. On his department Facebook, he said Katla could act as an exhaust vent for gases released deep in Iceland’s southern volcanic belt and that emissions could also be cyclical, unconnected to any unusual activity."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433539498.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit secretary dominic raab computer says no","story":"The Brexit Secretary attacked EU leaders for refusing to show enough imagination to strike a win-win deal - as he doubled down on Theresa May’s negotiating strategy.Mr Raab dismissed recent turmoil in Brexit talks as “a bump in the road” and insisted the PM won’t abandon her Chequers proposals.Speaking after the Salzburg summit where European leaders shot down Mrs May’s plans, the Brexit Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show today: “It’s clear a change was made very late on by the EU in their response.This is a bump in the road - we will hold our nerve, we will keep our cool and we will keep negotiating in good faith.What we are not going to do is be dictated to.

And John McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn hopes to topple Theresa May before Christmas to start reversing the damage of her war on the poor, disabled, public services, education and health. The Shadow Chancellor also said Labour is plotting a 15-year revolution in power that will put workers’ rights, the NHS, social care and industry at the heart of a bid to make Britain a fairer place to live once again. With the Tories in disarray over Brexit, the possibility of an autumn general election looms.  And in an exclusive interview with the Mirror, Mr McDonnell said: “We’re ready… and we’ll win. “I want the election as soon as possible. Eight years of Tory austerity has left people wanting real change. So we’ll provide them with a radical manesto. “We could be in place tomorrow. I think the third term will be our most exciting. “I think  the last election had lasted another week or two, we would be in government. “Everyone thought that was a flash in the pan, there was talk about ‘Peak Corbyn’. Actually, we’ve consolidated that. The polls now are between 38 and 44, permanently. We need another 4 or 5% to get into government. “Once we get into government, that first Queen’s Speech will be popular. We will put money into people’s pockets, provide a real living wage, restore trade union rights, end \u0026shyprivatisation and start investing in public services and in the infrastructure that will give us the jobs.  “I want the Tories held to account for what they’ve done. Apart from eight years of austerity, their handling of Brexit has had a direct impact on the economy and people’s living standards. “I want them held to account. I want them out.” Mr McDonnell, 67, will today deliver a keynote speech at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool – as the party maps out its vision of a Britain for all. It will unveil a radical plan that includes renationalising water, rail, energy and mail within the first five years of government. A National Care Service to tackle the social care crisis and end cuts will be launched. Labour is also planning a National Education Service to slash classroom sixes and increase teacher input.  Billions of pounds will be pumped into the NHS to restore it to the service that was the envy of the world until the Tories starting dismantling it. And workers could be \u0026pound500 a year better off with the launch of “inclusive ownership” of big firms in a bid to narrow the wage gap between staff and bosses. Mr McDonnell will tell delegates: “Workers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the s that it makes. If Labour does last three years, Mr McDonnell will by then be 82. But he insisted the next generation of MPs is ready for the \u0026shychallenge of keeping the party in power. He added: “You’ve got the likes of Becky Long-Bailey, Richard Burgon, Angie Rayner, Kate Osamor. They’re committed, working class young people, with an eye for detail, really good advocates of our policy.” Mr McDonnell demanded the PM quit over her Brexit handling.   He said: “Theresa May has proved herself \u0026shyincapable of negotiating her way out of a paper bag. I have no sympathy for her. “She’s got us into this mess, she’s got a responsibility to the country to go. Asked whether he believed the PM would secure an EU deal, he replied: “She’ll get some form of deal, probably a fudge. It won’t be one that even her own party will support.” Labour has set six tests for any deal including a strong relationship with Europe, the same rights, \u0026shyprotections and benefits as now and fair migration.

Benefits chief Margaret Greenwood refused to rule out the bombshell move after flaws and cuts in the system forced thousands of desperate families to foodbanks. The policy sht comes ahead of Ms Greenwood\u0027s address on Monday to the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool - where she will launch a year-long review into redesigning the “toxic” benefits system. Labour\u0027s official policy is to “pause and fix” UC. But disabled activists want to go further and “stop and scrap” it. Now Ms Greenwood has said she is “looking into” whether the multi-billion pound system should be scrapped entirely – adding: “We\u0027re not ruling anything out.”   Real Britain Fringe 2018: The Mirror takes powerful stories from Wigan Pier project to Labour Party Conference  In an exclusive interview with the Mirror, she also:  Said Labour would ban all benefit sanctions for people who turn up late to a JobCentre Confirmed Labour would end the benefits freeze by raising rates in line with inflation every year - something party chiefs stopped short of saying in last year\u0027s general election Claimed her ambition is to end all private firms carrying out disability benefit tests - but didn\u0027t fully commit to doing so Revealed Department for Work and Pensions  staff call their system the circle of hell.  Last week Tory ministers claimed ditching UC and reverting to the old system would cause massive disruption and be “complex and expensive - because the changes have become increasingly embedded. But the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary said: We need to query that assertion. Because we need to know exactly what is and is not practicable to do. Asked  she could envisage Labour wanting to undo the whole of UC, she said: This is something we\u0027re sort of in the process of looking into.  Asked  she ruled out scrapping UC in its entirety she said: We\u0027re not ruling anything out, because we think it\u0027s important to be on top of all of the detail of it before making a decision. Ex-teacher Ms Greenwood became MP for Wirral West in 2015 – ousting now-Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey. During her speech she will announce a consultation into redesigning the entire benefits system, “changing the narrative” from punishment to support. It will invite contributions from Labour members, benefit claimants and charities and aim to form the blueprint for a new system by this time next year. She said Tory ministers have “vilied” people on benefits. “I meet a lot of people in their middle years who say \u0027I can\u0027t face going to the Jobcentre because I find it too humiliating\u0027,” she said.  “Well that\u0027s absolutely wrong, because those people have worked 20, 30 years, they\u0027re entitled to get support. “They shouldn\u0027t be made to feel that somehow there\u0027s a stigma attached to them.” She added: “If you talk to people working in the social security system at the moment, I\u0027ve had it described to me as the circle of hell. “We\u0027re not going to be squandering money on a punitive regime which at the moment seems to have lost sight of itself. It seems to be punishment for punishment\u0027s sake.” Labour plans to take the \u0026pound240million spent running benefit sanctions – which dock people\u0027s payments for a month – and spend it instead on “employment and careers support”.  Sanctions would not be wiped out completely, she admitted, but she claimed the system would move away from “punitive” measures. “We\u0027re not going to be saying we won\u0027t do anything  people are defrauding the system, of course we will,” Ms Greenwood said. “But when it comes to using a stick to beat people, when it comes to forcing people to jump through hoops, we\u0027re not prepared to do that.” Ms Greenwood told the Mirror she would ban any benefit sanctions for turning up late to a Jobcentre appointment. She added: “At the moment someone can be sanctioned for being late for a Jobcentre interview, missing the bus, and lose a month\u0027s money. “We think this is really punitive, unnecessary and highly damaging. “So what we\u0027re going to say is we will not continue with that regime. We will absolutely stop the punitive sanctions regime.”  But sanctions could continue for people who miss their entire appointments. Ms Greenwood said: “You\u0027d have to look at what the reason was why they missed it.” The review will also look at the privately-run “assessments” for disability benefits PIP and ESA. The tests are regularly branded a failure after two-thirds of appeals against them were successful. Labour has vowed to scrap the current system but has not said what would come in its place. Asked  she would rule out outsourcing the tests to private firms in future, Ms Greenwood said: “I\u0027d have to look at the costings of that. The ambition would be to, certainly.” Meanwhile there was confusion over Labour\u0027s policy last year when Jeremy Corbyn said the benefits freeze would end – but stopped short of saying rates would be raised in line with inflation. Speaking to the Mirror, however, Ms Greenwood said: “We would end the benefits freeze, and that would mean uprating in line with inflation every year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labours centre left politicians vow","story":"NewsLabour\u0027s centre left politicians vow to stay and fight as they attacked praise of Militant, anti-Semitism and \u0027navel gazing\u0027MPs, councillors and campaigners said they were not leaving the party or joining another despite often receiving abuse and being told to \u0027f*** off and join the Tories\"Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent20:51, 23 SEP 2018News \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour\u0027s centre left politicians vow to stay and fight as they attacked praise of Militant, anti-Semitism and \u0027navel gazing\u0027.  At a rally of Progress - the group set up to help Tony Blair win power within Labour - MPs, councillors and campaigners said they were not leaving the party or joining another despite often receiving abuse and being told to \u0027f*** off and join the Tories.   In a defiant speech the Chair of Progress Alison McGovern admitted: Le in the Labour Party at the moment is far from easy and I know that sometimes the behaviour of those on the hard left who think they act on behalf of the leadership can cause us distress.   But the Wirral South MP said she would not leave Labour and would continue fighting for its goal of giving power to working people. She added: At times recently, we have seen the Labour movement at its worst. A party that cannot demonstrate it can deal with vile anti-Semitism can\u0027t govern and nor will it deserve to. Ilford North MP Wes Streeting attacked shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler\u0027s decision to praise Liverpool\u0027s Militant-dominated council for setting an illegal budget in the 1980s.  Mr Streeting said Militant\u0027s record was not something to celebrate on the platform of a Labour conference. He said: Back then, when the Labour Party was tearing itself apart with internal battles, families like mine were suffering under Tory government. Plans for a breakaway party were on the road to nowhere and Labour remained the only means for achieving progressive goals, he said.  But he warned that the introspection and battles over internal party procedures seen at the Liverpool conference were killing the promise and hope of our party and keeping this Tory Government in power. Mr Streeting urged Labour moderates to stand up for the proud centre-left tradition in our party and take on the toxic political culture that calls us Red Tories and shouts \u0027shame\u0027 at trade unionists on the conference floor .

The Unite general secretary warned the party leader\u0027s internal critics to fall in line or face the chop. Corbyn supporters want beefed-up powers making it easer to oust MPs seen as disloyal to the Labour boss. They believe boosting democracy in constituency parties will give members a better chance of getting rid of candidates who fail to give him sufficient backing. Supporting mandatory reselection, Mr McCluskey told the Mirror/Unite Real Britain fringe: “I believe there are certain MPs within our party who are almost asking to be deselected.”  As activists cheered and applauded, he went on: “They really don\u0027t want to be part of this exciting transformation that\u0027s taking place. “All my le I have sought a government that would bring about the irreversible sht in balance of power in favour of working people. “We now have an opportunity.” Members who railed against MPs were not guilty of “bullying” but wanted to exercise “accountability”, he insisted. “You\u0027ve already heard the terminology of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027intimidation \u0027 and \u0027intolerance,” said the workers\u0027 leader. “I\u0027ve got another word for them – it\u0027s called \u0027accountability\u0027.  “It\u0027s not about bullying, it\u0027s about simply wanting people to be accountable to the very people who go out night in night out in the wind and the rain to try and persuade people to vote them into power. “We want accountability and we will get it.” Earlier, Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth hit out at activists from Momentum, the grassroots campaign group loyal to Mr Corbyn, who have called for every sitting MP to face a full, open selection. They should unite and focus on the real enemy, he said. It comes after a row erupted on the conference floor over the issue between Corbyn supporters and trade unions, who were in favour of a compromise. Mr Ashworth said: I think it\u0027s disappointing when we heard on the conference floor people shouting \u0027shame on the trade unions\u0027.

He was speaking alongside victims of cruel Tory austerity yesterday told of their misery as the Mirror’s Real Britain fringe gave them a voice. They revealed their suffering in moving speeches which left some delegates at the Labour Conference fringe in tears. Ros Wynne Jones has been retracing the route George Orwell took to write The Road to Wigan Pier and telling the stories of those who Tory Britain has left behind. She told the fringe meeting: “One of the huge frustrations for us 80 years on is seeing the loss of potential in working class communities up and down the country.” The Mirror journalist explained how she had spent five years documenting the human consequences of Tory austerity and how the Wigan Pier Project.  She said: “I did a trip to Wigan in 2015 and I met a vicar in her church where there were lots of people sleeping and a foodbank and she said Orwell would weep  he could see Wigan now. Ros has spoken to 200 people along this route. She explained: “Orwell wanted comfortably off Britain to listen to the other Britain and it is something that holds true today.”  She said that it came as no surprise to her travelling around the country and hearing people’s stories that in many of these areas people voted to leave the EU -often because they wanted to be heard. “Our response to that can’t be to tell people they’re stupid and racist,” she said. Ros told the packed meeting: “Ten years on it shouldn’t be the bankers at Lehman brothers that are having a party, it’s us who should be celebrating the fact that these communities have survived at all.” Ros was joined by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, General Secretary of Unite the Union Len McCluskey and footballer turned campaigner Neville Southall.  But she also introduced two \u0027real\u0027 people to the conference whose experiences showed how the government\u0027s policies are destroying families and communities. Stacey Bridge ran into financial problems after not being able to afford her dad’s funeral after he was violently murdered in Liverpool. She ended up homeless and at the Merseyside Youth Foodbank - a special foodbank for young people in Liverpool. But after relying on the food bank she is now a volunteer and also coaches football. “It’s more than a bag of food,” she said, explaining how a young woman had got onto a music course with her help and support.  Amina Weston told of the devastation of being made homeless by an unscrupulous landlord when she was pregnant in a moving poem she had written about her experiences. She is currently bringing up her baby in temporary accommodation in Leeds but she’s still managed to set up Education Aid with her sister - a charity to help families with school unorms.  She described losing her home: “My world torn apart my le ripped from under me.” Adding: “Anxiety, paranoia and depression are my new friends”. Although Amina has struggled she has managed to set up an education charity with her sister to help families with school unorms called Education Aid. But she warned: “This could happen to anyone”.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell praised Ros and the Mirror for the work of the Real Britain column. He said: “It’s been fundamental in exposing some of the experiences people are having in this country and the shame we should be feeling.”  Len McCluskey also praised Ros\u0027s work and the Mirror\u0027s campaigning. Week-in-week-out it exposes whats actually going on in the real world. He said that Amina\u0027s poem and it brought tears to my eyes and it makes you realise we\u0027re about - we\u0027re about fighting for fairness, for decency for justice, for all people. The panel also boasted Neville Southall legendary Everton and Wales goalkeeper turned social media activist. When not using his 144,000-follower Twitter account to berate the Tories, Nev hands it over to people who he believes need a wider audience – child abuse charities, drugs helplines, LGBT+ causes and even sex workers. The passionate campaigner spoke of his frustration with the lack of progress on those areas he cares strongly about.

The Deputy Labour Leader said the Kremlin had reinvented blitzkrieg for the digital age through a campaign of misinformation, malicious technology and dark money.  He suggested Theresa May \u0027declined\u0027 a request from security services to investigate Russian influence ahead of the the Brexit referendum.  And a whistleblower claimed Russian agents may still be actively infiltrating and undermining political networks in the UK.  Speaking at an event on the Fringe of Labour Party Conference, Mr Watson called for a full-scale pubic inquiry into Russian influence in the Brexit Referendum.   Mr Watson said it was a “dark story about the frontiers of the new Cold War. “It’s dark because it is turbo powered by tech. “And unlike the last cold war, Putin’s Russia is winning.” Mr Watson said: “All of us need to wake up to the true scale of what’s been going on. “Now is the time when the government must drop the three wise monkeys act: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil - about the biggest threat to the integrity of our democracy. The Russian attack. “It’s time we woke up to the reality that Russia has reinvented the blitzkreig for the digital age. A new strategy to attack far behind our old defences, to attack us from within. “They’re prepared to kill on the streets of Salisbury. But just as dangerous is their long war to ide and rule.” He added: “This is where we need government agencies and authorities to step in, but I’m not confident that they will.” Mr Watson has joined forces with fellow Labour MPs Darren Jones and Liam Byrne to launch a petition calling for a full public inquiry, with powers similar to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the US election. He said: “Without the powers to interview under caution, to subpoena documents and transactions records and to request assistance from foreign jurisdictions, such networks are practically impossible to crack.”  If such a petition were to gain 100,000 signatures, it could force the issue to be debated on the floor of the House of Commons. Mr Watson also claimed to have been told Theresa May, while she was Home Secretary, declined a request from the security services to investigate Leave.EU founder Arron Banks. He said: I don\u0027t know  this is true, and none of us will  there isn\u0027t a proper investigation Whatever the Prime Minister did or didn’t do now is the time for the truth to out. The Mirror has approached the Home Office for comment. A spokesman for Arron Banks said the request was declined because there was nothing to investigate.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found pressure at work, home and in our social lives has lead 40 per cent of the nation to now believe they suffer from some sort of anxiety. More than one in five reckon they are now more fretful, edgy or tense than they were five years ago with health concerns their major worry. Others have become more stressed about taking time off work, socialising, their finances and their career.  The study, by wellness brand Healthspan’s CBD oil  supplement, also found six in 10 of those suffering from anxiety have even sought medical advice from their GP. Another six in 10 have turned to exercise to try and combat the issue, while 59 per cent reliant on medication and supplements, such as CBD oil. Dr Jen Bateman a clinical psychologist on behalf of Healthspan says: ‘The rise in both social anxiety and anxiety is due to a range of factors. “Our lives are becoming busier and can feel overwhelming - we’re constantly striving for more and better. “Worldwide events are being streamed into the phone in the palm of our hands in our highly-connected digital worlds, and it’s challenging to ‘switch-off’, which our brains need to rest and stay calm. “The constant stream of demands and data is overpowering for many, especially for those with a vulnerability to developing anxiety.” The study also found 62 per cent of people believe le is becoming increasingly more anxiety-provoking with the average adult rating their anxiety levels at almost three out of five – with five being very severe. One in twenty put their anxiety at a full five.  It also emerged anxiety sufferers will struggle four times a day with their condition, but more than three quarters will keep it quiet from others around them. Anxiety has a huge effect on the lives of some sufferers though with almost one in 10 saying the condition led to them losing their job while another 19 per cent quit their role. Sufferers have also seen others end relationships , lose friends , put on weight  or avoid socialising . Worryingly, the study, carried out via OnePoll, found many are suffering in silence with just 28 per cent admitting they feel comfortable talking to their friends or work colleagues about their anxiety. Dr Sarah Brewer added: “A tsunami of anxiety is impacting all areas of people’s lives and health. “Many are turning to products like cannabidiol to treat anxiety so it’s not surprising that CBD Oil is one of the fastest growing health trends. “But the recent Government U-turn to legalise medical marijuana has left consumers confused and just one in 10 said they would know what to look for when buying a CBD supplement.  “As the market is becoming flooded with new products that look ethical but contain few active ingredients, it’s important to select a quality product. “I recommend looking for a supplier who provides an independent analysis certication showing the actual level of CBD  and THC  - products that simply claim to use ‘whole plant extract’ are misleading. “You should also compare the actual milligram  levels of cannabidiol  in the product and ensure the company is a member of the Cannabis Trade Association. “Also, check with your GP or a pharmacist  you are taking prescribed medication, as CBD oil can interact with certain drugs, including those used to treat anxiety and depression.” "},{"url":null,"title":"calls ban new drivers carrying","story":"NewsCoroner calls for a ban on new drivers carrying passengers after two teenagers died in horror crashCoroner is writing to the Government to request they introduce “graduated” driving licences and the families of the two girls who died are backing himShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJeremy Armstrong19:24, 23 SEP 2018Updated19:29, 23 SEP 2018NewsThe deaths of Skye Mitchell, pictured, and her friend have sparked calls for a ban on newly qualied drivers taking passengers \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA coroner has called for a ban on newly qualied drivers carrying passengers after a smash that killed two teenagers.

Cumbria assistant coroner Robert Chapman is writing to the Government to request “graduated” driving licences.  MPs and safety groups are also backing such a scheme, as operated in the US, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Sky and Caitlin, of Millom, Cumbria, were killed last July on the A595. Mr Chapman ruled they died of multiple injuries and added the Yaris was travelling a little too fast for the wet conditions.  He said: “It wouldn’t have been too fast  the road had been dry.

Hugh Bingham passed away at the age of 78 in South Africa in July, but his death was only revealed this weekend. Experts believe there may be documents and letters among his personal effects that could reveal what happened to his brother. Mr Bingham was also working on a book, which may contain further information about the mystery.  Lord Lucan vanished in 1974. He fled his home in Belgravia, Central London, after killing the family nanny, Sandra Rivett, 29. James Sanders, an investigative journalist who knew him well, said Mr Bingham would often hint that he had information about Lord Lucan’s fate, but failed to provide any solid evidence.  Mr Sanders told the Mail on Sunday : “He would talk at  about his brother’s innocence, yet refused to reveal  Lucan was still alive or where he had lived.  “It was impossible to know  they were in touch, though it seemed likely.”  Mr Bingham had been living a reclusive le in a suburb of Johannesburg, where he had worked as librarian for the Theosophical Society, a non-religious organisation. The Oxford graduate moved to South Africa months after his brother’s disappearance. This sparked unsubstantiated rumours that he may have been in contact with his sibling, who had managed to slip out of Britain. Mr Bingham – who always maintained that his brother was innocent – had been ghostwriting Lord Lucan’s “autobiography”. The book was due to put forward theories about his possible escape from England, and detail ious guises that he may then have adopted.  Speaking in 2016, after the High Court declared his brother dead, Mr Bingham said: “John had no option but to flee. He would have considered his chances of a fair trial to be very slim.” Mr Bingham said one of the theories covered in his book was that Lord Lucan escaped Britain with a fake passport and built a new le as a farm manager in KwaZulu Natal province, South Africa. Lord and Lady Veronica Lucan were fighting for custody of their three children. He is thought to have killed Ms Rivett after mistaking her for his we.

Cliodhna Ross, 46, and husband Stuart are hoping to sell their four-bedroom Maida Vale property by asking potential new owners to pay \u0026pound25-a-ticket to win it, mortgage free. The family have no need to leave their dream home, but for the fact they are beginning to struggle carrying seven-year-old Ollie up and down the stairs. Financial services project manager Cliodhna, 46, said: “We knew almost as soon as he was born that Ollie had Down’s syndrome.  His condition comes with delayed learning and general mobility, but in general that doesn’t seem to be much of a problem. However having had all the loft work done and turned the flat into our ideal home, we realised Ollie wasn’t terribly mobile and was struggling to get steady on his legs. We simply cannot get him to go downstairs.  And  he wants to go upstairs you have to heft him over your shoulders which has become much harder as he’s grown older.” The Rosses have lived in the upmarket west London apartment building since 2001.  In that time they secured planning permission to extend into the roof area, creating a rooftop terrace with astonishing views of London’s skyline. But after realising the dficulties Ollie will increasingly have navigating his way up down the floors in the mansion block, the Rosses put their home on the market to find something more suited to his needs, and those of his sister Issy, eight. However, due to market fluctuations, the house remained unsold. Cliodhna said: “We went from having all the room we needed to having to move.  “We put our property on the market in April this year but the timing was appalling – nobody wanted to buy an expensive property in Central London. ‘’People are simply not putting their properties on the market unless they absolutely have to. “If you do sell your property at a bargain price, chances are you won’t be able to afford a replacement property. ‘’Eventually we took 10 per cent off the price and still couldn’t find a buyer.  “The kids are now happily settled in school, and Ollie is settled at his special needs school so we don’t want to disrupt them by moving too far away.” The luxurious apartment sprawls over the third and fourth floors of a well-maintained, red-brick mansion block on one of Maida Vale’s wide avenues. It features four bedrooms, two balconies, a sitting room and a large kitchen/diner, as well as two bathrooms and a cloakroom.  It’s also unique in having its own private roof terrace, as well as access to the building’s communal garden which is maintained by a professional gardener. The property covers approximately 1,500 square feet and comes complete with high-spec kitchen appliances from Bosch, Neff and Siemens. Outside the front door, just minutes away are the boutique stores of Lauderdale Parade and Clton Road, and it’s just a short walk from the scenic canals of Little Venice.  Since setting up the raffle in May, thousands of tickets have been sold – but the couple are a long way from having the minimum number needed to cover the cost of the four-bedroom flat. Cliodhna and house-husband Stuart, 50, are hoping to have sold at least 85,000 tickets before the closing deadline of December 31st, to find the perfect forever-home for their family.  A percentage of the ticket sales will cover fees, and also be shared equally between two charities. The first is KIDS, which provides support services to disabled children, young people and their families. The second is The London Community Foundation, which designs and manages funds on behalf of those philanthropic iniduals and organisations that wish to tackle poverty, inequality and exclusion across the capital.  In addition, there is a \u0026pound100,000 second prize and five runner-up prizes of \u0026pound10,000 in cash each. Entrants will not only have to pay \u0026pound25 for a ticket, but complete a crossword, to stay on the right side of strict gambling regulations. And the winner will also be liable to pay stamp duty on the property, as well as any usual apartment block maintenance costs.

Dr Richard Shepherd, who has worked on more than 23,000 dead bodies, re-examined Diana\u0027s for the official inquiry into her death two decades ago. Unsurprisingly, people asked him ious questions about the princess\u0027s body after the second autopsy, such as whether she was beautul and peaceful. Others questioned: Was she pregnant? Since Diana\u0027s death, there have been repeated claims she was expecting a child when she and her lover, Dodi Fayed, died in the horror crash in the French capital.  Dodi\u0027s father, Mohamed Al Fayed, claimed the 36-year-old princess had told him she was pregnant in a phone call shortly before the tragedy in August 1997. And in 2007, a French investigative journalist alleged Diana was almost certainly nine to 10 weeks pregnant when her and her lover\u0027s Mercedes crashed. But addressing the pregnancy question, Dr Shepherd said there was no pathological evidence that the princess was expecting a baby when she died.  Speaking to the Daily Mail , the dad-of-two, now 65, said: Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they\u0027re pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?   He left the question \u0027hanging\u0027, according to the newspaper.  The pathologist, whose new memoir has just been published, also claimed that Diana would have been here for son Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, in May  she had worn her seatbelt.  If she had taken this step, he believes she would have survived the tragedy in the Pont de l\u0027Alma road tunnel with a black eye or maybe a broken arm. Driver Henri Paul, said to have been twice the British drink-drive limit, also died in the devastating car crash. The only survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees.  A string of official enquiries later ruled Diana and Dodi, 42, died in an accident when their French driver crashed their car while drunk in the tunnel. The jury at the princess\u0027s inquest found the pair had been unlawfully killed and their deaths were the result of “gross negligence” on the part of Henri and paparazzi who were following the vehicle on motorbikes. During his career, Dr Shepherd, who has two children, Chris, 37, and Anna, 35, and three stepdaughters, has worked on other major incidents.

Now a bizarre secret behaviour of hers has been revealed - and it could be the reason behind her longevity. It turns out that her Majesty used to sit inside the hollow of a dead oak tree and enjoy a wee dram of WHISKY. She would do this after a long day hunting, Lord Tollemache, owner of Helmingham Hall in Suffolk, has said.   “The Queen used to go shooting [at Helmingham Park] every winter, Tollemache told The Times .  And that particular tree, a dead oak tree - when they start getting old they to from the centre so it is hollow - and she used to shelter in the hollow and have a little whisky during the day,” he said.  As Britain\u0027s oldest person, who is 112, recently revealed that the secret to a long le is whisky - perhaps this explains the Queen\u0027s longevity.  The strange revelation comes as comes after the announcement that a photo of \u0027the Queen’s Oak\u0027 can be seen in an exhibition by royal photographer Adrian Houston.  The exhibition is called A Portrait of a Tree and will be held at the Unit gallery in Hanover Square, London, until September 28.  Another tree with a strange royal drinking connection will feature in the display - but this one involves the Queen Mother .  Raymond Blanc, head chef at Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons, said that the Queen Mum and her entourage of knights and ladies-in-waiting used to drink champagne and Dubonnet in the shadows of a cedar in its Oxfordshire gardens.

The Met Office say that those in the south will enjoy sunshine and warmer weather those in the north will have to endure more wind and rain.   There are fears lingering moisture from former Hurricane Florence could clash with another weather front to bring more strong winds- but those in the south will enjoy warm weather.  The Met Office have warned: A north/south split developing through the middle of the week. Becoming cloudier and windy with some rain in the north. but remaining settled, dry and mostly sunny in the south.  They added: Through the rest of September the weather should stay largely settled with long spells of sunshine and generally light winds.  For October, settled and drier conditions are likely to dominate across many parts of the UK during the beginning of this period.  An Accuweather forecast for the north of the country read: “Winds are not expected to be as high as the gusts produced by Storm Ali, but just as much of an impact could be felt. “Recent heavy rains and winds have weakened structures and trees, and the wet ground may result in trees toppling more easily. Sporadic power outages are also possible. Temperatures will fall to as low as 5C in parts of Scotland this morning, while Northern Ireland will experience chilling winds.    Parts of England will also feel very cold, with temperatures as low as 6C in some isolated regions in the early hours of the morning. Meteorologist Becky Mitchell said: “Strong winds will pick up towards the middle part of the afternoon, particularly for East Anglia and south-east England. “Here gusts could reach 50-60 miles per hour. It will be a very wet day across England and Wales, but that rain will eventually clear away. “We will also see temperatures fall away quite quickly, possible into low single figures.”   There are currently no warnings in place. A yellow warning for wind and rain today was cancelled after the forecasted weather was not as bad as first feared.  Two storms have already hit the UK this autumn - Ali and Bronagh but at the moment it is not known when the third  will arrive. Three-day UK weather forecast  Today  : It will be overcast with rain and brisk winds in the south during the morning. However, it will become drier and brighter in the afternoon with lighter winds. Northern parts will be mostly dry partly cloudy with a few showers in the north-west with winds gentle to moderate from the north-west.

Briar Butler, 30, from Barrow in Furness may have just months left to live after doctors discovered that she had an incurable brain tumour. Since her heartbreaking diagnosis in June, she has vowed to spend as much time as she can with her boy, Noah, four. Noah is \u0027obsessed\u0027 with Santa and Briar wants to make what could be their last Christmas together as special as possible. Wanting to help with her dying wish, her friends and family have rallied round and set up a crowdfunding page to raise money for a trip to lapland.   Briar told Daily Record : I\u0027m doing this for Noah, to give him some magic memories of me before I go. I\u0027m so scared that he won\u0027t remember me.  He loves Santa and he loves Christmas, so I know that it will be perfect. She was allowed to leave hospital to see Noah start school recently. Noah was more happy about me being there than anything else. He was saying, \u0027my mummy\u0027s better\u0027, she continued. When he saw me, he said \u0027your hair\u0027s grown back!\u0027, but I told him it was just a wig. \u0027Well you look beautul mummy\u0027 is what he said. He doesn\u0027t understand everything that\u0027s happened, and he doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m dying.  The tumour is thought to be as a result of a birth defect from conception, but the family have claimed she has been let down by doctors who have misdiagnosed her for years. She was initially diagnosed with Bipolar disorder when she was 22 because of her unstable behaviour. But medics now say that this would have been due to her tumour.  But the true extent of her illness was revealed in June this year when she fell ill following a spell of headaches that lasted six weeks.  Briar collapsed at home and was found by police unresponsive on the floor with her son\u0027s bicycle helmet on in an attempt to relieve the pain.   Woman heartbroken by husband\u0027s death reveals amazing way he continues to save lives  She was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital where medics discovered she had a tumour. Briar had the le-saving op on June 24 this year and has since gone under the kne five more times. She said: My mum hadn\u0027t heard from me for 24 hours. I hadn\u0027t been answering the phone, so she notied the police. They came round and found me unresponsive on the floor with my son\u0027s bicycle helmet on - I was trying anything to relieve the pain.  I don\u0027t remember a lot about it, and I didn\u0027t even recognise my mum when I woke up in Royal Preston Hospital.

Savanna Greywind, 22, was eight months pregnant when she went missing from her home in August 2017. Her parents and frantic boyfriend Ashton Matheny raised the alarm sparking a major police search, according to US media reports.  A neighbour reported hearing a baby\u0027s cries coming from the home of 38-year-old Brooke Crews. When officers arrived they found a newborn they suspected to be Savanna\u0027s child. Crews initially claimed the child was her own. Days later, the tragic victim\u0027s body was found wrapped in plastic and floating down a river in Fargo, North Dakota.  William Hoehn, 32, has been charged with the conspiracy to commit murder. He allegedly told Crews: If she\u0027s not dead, she is now, prosecuting lawyer Ryan Younggren said. However Hoehn says that he did not know Crews had planned to kill Greywind. He claims that when he came home he discovered Crews cleaning up blood in the bathroom. She is then said to have presented him with the baby and saying, this is our family. Greywind disappeared after visiting her next-door neighbour Crews for a dress fitting on August 19.  It was claimed by Crews that Savanna ed two days later at 3.30am and gave her the baby girl. Crews eventually confessed to police that she had tried to get the newborn from Savanna. Court documents read: “Crews admitted she had taken advantage of Savanna Greywind in an attempt to obtain her child and possibly keep the child as her own. While officials still have not understood how Greywind\u0027s body ended up in the river forensics concluded that she bled to death. Defence lawyer Daniel Borgen said she was already dead when Hoehn came into the bathroom, and he tried to cover the crime.

With one rule from their mother, Always stay human, the pair, along with red-haired pal Hannie Schaft, carried out a campaign of sabotage against Nazi invaders. The siblings learned how to shoot, sabotaged bridges and railway lines with dynamite, and smuggled Jewish children out of concentration camps during World War Two . In an incredibly brave act, they also tricked Nazi men using seduction - so they could lure them to a secluded spot in the Netherlands and execute them. Although the pair and Hannie all had youthful looks, Freddie was the youngest and reportedly appeared at least two years younger than her actual age.  Her innocent looks meant she was easily overlooked as a potential threat by Nazi officials, who would rarely stop her as she passed by on her bicycle. Unbeknown to the officials, she had firearms hidden in her bike basket. As part of their trick, Freddie and the other two girls would seduce their targets in bars and ask them  they wanted to go for a stroll, the Washington Post reports. After the Nazi collaborators agreed to do so, the youngsters would lead them into a wooded area where, instead of a kiss, they would receive a bullet. In a later interview, Freddie, the first of the girls to kill a soldier, said: We had to do it. She added: It was a necessary evil, killing those who betrayed the good people. Freddie, who was only seven when Adolf Hitler came to power, died earlier this month, just a day before her 93rd birthday, according to the  .  The 92-year-old passed away on September 5 in a nursing home close to where she, her older sister Truus and Hannie had courageously sabotaged the Nazis. She and Truus had joined the resistance after a man turned up at their front door. Speaking to VICE decades after the war, Freddie recalled: A man wearing a hat came to the door and asked my mother  he could ask us [to fight in the resistance]. And he did, so yes, she was okay with it. The siblings\u0027 and Hannie\u0027s targets reportedly included high-ranking Nazi officers. And as well as luring their targets into woodland and executing them, the group would help to smuggle Jewish kids across the country and out of \u0027death camps\u0027. They would also gun down Nazis from a bike during the occupation of the Netherlands. A loved one recalled how, after the Oversteegen siblings were taught to shoot, Truus would ride on a bicycle with Freddie sitting on the back shooting.  The relative said that because they were girls, they went unnoticed. In addition to developing shooting skills, the sisters learned to march in the woods. Later, a Nazi big shot was executed at the same site by a male member of the resistance after being seduced in a bar and lured there by Truus. That day, Freddie\u0027s job was to keep a lookout from a vantage point. Truus had met him in an expensive bar, seduced him and then took him for a walk in the woods. She was like: \u0027Want to go for a stroll?\u0027, she later told VICE. And of course he wanted to. But during the \u0027stroll\u0027, the Nazi was gunned down. Freddie recalled how his hole had already been dug, but we weren\u0027t allowed to be there for that part. Before the war, the Oversteegen family, who lived on a barge, had hidden people from Lithuania in the hold of their ship.

Historically Katla – Icelandic for kettle or boiler – in Iceland has erupted every 50 years but its been a century since it last went off. That means an explosion is long overdue and its showing all the signs it could happen sooner rather than later. Its cone is hidden under a glacier on a 5,000ft peak so monitoring it is dficult but Icelandic and British scientists have noticed it\u0027s producing \u0027huge\u0027 levels of carbon dioxide.  That suggests its magma chambers could be filling, one of the precursors to an eruption, reports The Sunday Times. If it does blow its mammoth size means a giant ash cloud three times as large as the one which wreaked travel chaos in 2010 could be produced.  Thousands of passengers were left stranded when Eyjafjallajokull\u0027s plume grounded flights across Europe. A report by Evgenia Ilyinskaya, of Leeds University\u0027s Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics, found Katla is producing between 12 and 24 kilotons of carbon dioxide a day. Only two volcanoes are known to emit more.  Describing Katla as highly hazardous she said CO2 being released at such a scale usually suggests an eruption is on the cards. She said: : This is a clear sign we need to keep an eye of Katla. She isn\u0027t just doing nothing, and these findings confirm that there is something going on.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was in command when the Malaysian Airlines flight carrying 238 other passengers and crew vanished mid-flight in 2014. Hundreds of theories have been put forward for the Boeing 777\u0027s sudden disappearance, but new evidence could point the finger of blame towards Shah, after the discovery of his social media activity suggested a man with \u0027self-destructive\u0027 tendencies.  In the year leading up the MH370 mystery, Shah used Facebook to pursue Malaysian twin-sister models 34 years younger than him, leaving sexually suggestive comments on numerous occasions.   The 26-year-old sisters, Lan Qi Hui and Qi Min Lan, received more than 97 messages from Shah during 2013 - most of which were ignored. Shah persistently urged the twins to visit Kuala Lumpar - where he lived with his we - and responded to one photo of Qi Min Lan in a bathrobe, asking \u0027Just shower?\u0027 On top of his obsessive messages to the girls, Zaharie frequently publicly criticised the Malaysian government, despite working for a state-owned airline.   MH370\u0027s final message revealed as frantic air traffic controllers desperately tried to make contact with the plane  In April 2013, leading up to the election of then-prime minister Najib Razak, Shah posted 119 times about Razak, before responding to his appointment with: \u0027There is a rebel in each and every one of us. Let it out!\u0027 He later went on to describe Razak as a \u0027moron\u0027. Aviation expert and editor-in-chief of airlineratings, Geoffrey Thomas, said it was alarming for a senior pilot to make political comments at all.  Thomas said: It should have raised serious alarm bells with the airline that you have someone flying who has such strong anti-government views. If a Qantas pilot did something like that, he would be spoken to and grounded. UK-based psychologist, Paul Dickens said: I think what you’re seeing is a degree of obsessional behaviour mixed with recklessness, which is unusual for a pilot.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann has three games to save his job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPatience is wearing thin with the Dundee hierarchy and manager Neil McCann has just three matches to save his job.The Tele understands the Dark Blues boss has until the next international break to turn his side’s fortunes around.However, a heavy loss to Hibs today followed by defeat to Hamilton next week could accelerate that process.The Tele also believes there is appetite for change at Dens and owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms have been urged to sound out potential successors to McCann.However, the key decision-makers at the club are prepared to give the current gaffer more time to get the results that could kickstart the Dark Blues’ season.That patience will only last so long, though.Next week’s trip to Hamilton is followed by a home game against Steve Clarke’s Kilmarnock before the Premiership takes another break with international football taking over.By then, results are a must  Neil is continue in his role as manager.Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer will be hoping for a midfield boost today against Hibs.Glen Kamara has missed almost the entire season, starting just the opening Betfred Cup group stage win over Stirling Albion and the 1-0 defeat at St Johnstone three weeks ago.The Finnish international injured his ankle after that victory in Stirling and has struggled on with it since.He suffered a recurrence a fortnight ago as he prepared to travel to join up with his national side and then missed last week’s trip to Ibrox.He has, though, ed to training this week and is hoping to be fit enough to play a part against the Hibees at Dens today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba4c39847e8e.jpg ","title":"dundee council urged to speed up land sales after just 62 affordable homes built in a year","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil bosses have been urged to speed up the sale of land for new homes to be built on across Dundee – after falling behind on their housebuilding targets.Just 62 affordable homes – offering low rent to people on modest incomes – were built in 2017-18, short of the 200 the council had planned. The authority has a strategy to build 1,000 by 2021.Numerous families across the city are desperate to move to more suitable properties but feel stuck in their current homes due to a lack of supply.Barry Lamont, a full-time parent to D-Jay, 9, and Rudi, 5, is keen to get out of his Hilltown home, which he shares with partner, Gemma, 25, who is also a full-time parent to their children.Barry said: “At the moment we are confined to the multi.

The problem we’ve got is the council is unable to progress with the sale of sites in Whitfield for us to develop.“We could be building 120 more houses there but we can’t because they can’t sell the land.“The council own all of the land there and  they were able to progress with that quicker then we would be able to get houses built there.

We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough. It’s not because they are bottom of the league that we should underestimate them.“They have a new coach and they showed last week they played very good in the first half and the thing is they have nothing to lose, we have everything to lose.“You see in this league there is not one game you can predict. Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba365a0ced19-846x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann urges his dundee players to be more decisive in front of goal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann has urged his players to be more decisive in front of goal against Hibs this weekend to finally get some Premiership points on the board.The Dark Blues host Neil Lennon’s men this Saturday still in search of their first positive result of the season and languishing at the foot of the table.With time marching on and teams above them picking up results, pressure is building at Dens Park on the management team.A wee bit of composure in front of goal, however, would be the perfect tonic to lt the spirits at Dens Park against the Hibees, according to gaffer Neil.That would have helped at Ibrox had Elton Ngwatala kept his cool in front of goal, despite being on his weaker side, as he raced beyond the Rangers defence with the score at 2-0.Kenny Miller played in the Frenchman in the 36th minute but Ngwatala dallied on the ball and didn’t even manage to get a shot off despite having just keeper Allan McGregor to beat.Had Dundee made that count, Neil insists the outcome of the match would’ve been dferent.He said: “Elton took an extra touch and I don’t think he needed to.“It was a blistering counter-attack, it was a lovely ball, and he should just take it early but his extra touch allows the defender to recover and doesn’t even make the keeper save.“I definitely believe it would have changed the outcome of the whole match but it’s been the story of our season where we don’t take chances or choose the right decision in the final third.”Poor decision-making has also cost the team dear in defence, with Ngwatala’s missed opportunity compounded shortly afterwards as Darren O’Dea brought Alfredo Morelos down for a penalty moments before half-time to end the match as any kind of contest.Neil added: “I felt we had enough of the game in between the second and third goal.“Darren gets injured and then makes a poor decision in the end because he was struggling.“I had no complaints about the penalty but it was a sore one because we were going in at 2-0 with us well in the game.”More frustration would follow for the Dark Blues as key man Kenny Miller saw red for a rash challenge while already on a yellow card.Referee Kevin Clancy brandished a straight red card for the tackle on Gers full-back Borna Barisic.The former Celtic, Wolves and Rangers striker will miss Saturday’s clash with another of his old clubs Hibs and the following trip to Hamilton after the club’s appeal against the decision was unsuccessful.And Miller says he’s “disappointed” to be missing out when his new club is desperate to turn their dreadful opening to the campaign around.Miller said: “Anyone who knows me knows I am not a dirty player.“My eyes were firmly on the ball throughout.“I went wholeheartedly to win the ball. I did win the ball but on the follow-through there is always going to be contact.“We have watched it back and I am actually pulling my leg away as soon as I touched the ball to try to minimise the contact.“I never went in to harm anybody and I think the red was brandished too quickly.“I have been in the game a long time but I have never gone in to hurt anybody.“It was an honest, genuine attempt to play the ball which I did.“So it is disappointing I am going to miss two games after just going to a new club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/41-Voyage-of-Discovery_maggies_penguin_parade_.jpg ","title":"this weekend farewell parade for maggies penguins in dundee ahead of auction","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNow really is your chance to p-p-p-pick up a penguin – for a great cause.Fans are preparing to say goodbye to the massively successful Maggie’s Penguin Parade this weekend before all 80 giant sculptures are auctioned at V\u0026ampA Dundee on Monday at 6.30pm.The full-size statues, plus 100 “baby” penguins, will be showcased at a farewell parade in the city’s Slessor Gardens today and Sunday.Each penguin has its own design – from Bonnie Dundee to Mr Sofishticated, Penguinstein and Hell’s Penguin.The project – which aims to raise half a million pounds for Maggie’s Dundee – challenged people to find all 80 penguin sculptures dotted throughout Dundee, Angus, Perthshire and Fe.All proceeds from the ticket-only Farewell Parade, which runs from 10am-5pm on both days, will also go to Maggie’s.Tickets are available from Dundee Box Office, by phone, online or in person on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"                          A BUS driver faces being sacked by Glasgow City Council after pulling over a coach load of Celtic fans to attack a rival motorist."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"country-legend-shania-twain-kicks-off-tour-in-glasgow-and-talks-storm-ali","story":"                          GLASGOW witnessed the spectacle of a letime with the arrival of country legend Shania Twain\u0027 highly-anticipated tour."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-dad-stephen-kinnaird-says-he-struggled-to-access-support-after-the-sudden-loss-of-his-partner","story":"                          A DAD has told of the \u0026ldquoheart wrenching moment he had to tell his young daughters that their mum and the love of his le was not going to survive after she had a major stroke at just 46."},{"url":null,"title":"graeme-mcgarry-can-leigh-griffiths-get-stuttering-celtic-firing-on-all-cylinders-again","story":"                          IT used to be said that at the Old Firm, you were never more than a defeat away from a crisis.

The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Sunday 23 Sep 2018

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Sunday 23 Sep 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03949000/03949601.jpg","title":"Temporary road restrictions for Loch Ness Marathon","story":" Motorists are being advised of ious temporary road closures and restrictions in place this weekend\u0026nbspduring the Loch Ness Marathon, River Ness 10K Race and River Ness 5K Fun Run.The closures will affect vehicular traffic, but pedestrian access and access for emergency vehicles will be maintained at all times.Alternative routes will be signposted.Information on the race route is available\u0026nbspat http:www.lochnessmarathon/Full details of the temporary road closures schedule with timings are as follows:8862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness road closed at its junction with the Viewpoint lay-by  to its junction with the A8852 Dalcrag Bridge-Foyers-lnverfarigaig-Dores Road from 07.00 hours to 11.00 hours on Sunday.8852 Dalcrag Bridge-Foyers-lnverfarigaig-Dores road closed at its junction with the 8862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness road to its junction with the C21 lnverfarigaig-Glenlia road from 09.45 hours to 11.30 hours on Sunday.8852 Dalcrag Bridge-Foyers-lnverfarigaig-Dores Road closed at its junction with the C21 lnverfarigaig-Glenlia Road to its junction with the U44 Foyers Road, from 10.15 hours to 11.30 hours on Sunday.8852 Dalcrag Bridge-Foyers-lnverfarigaig-Dores road closed at its junction with the U44 Foyers road to its junction with the C20 lnverfarigaig-Errogie road from 10.15 hours to\u0026nbspnoon on Sunday.8852 Dalcrag Bridge-Foyers-lnverfarigaig-Dores eoad closed at its junction with the C20 lnverfarigaig-Errogie road to its junction with the 8862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness road, from 10.30 hours to 13.45 hours on Sunday.8862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness eoad closed to northbound traffic between its junction with the 8852 Dalcrag Bridge-Foyers-lnverfarigaig-Dores road and its junction with the C10 Torbreck Road, from 10.15 hours to 16.00 hours on Sunday.8862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness road closed to northbound traffic between its junction with the C10 Torbreck Road and its junction with the Holm roundabout, from 10:15am to 10:50am and from 11:45 hours to 16.00 hours on Sunday.\u0026nbsp8862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness road closed at its junction with the C10 Torbreck Road to its junction with the Holm roundabout, from 10.50 hours to 11.45 hours on Sunday.Culduthel Avenue, Inverness closed at its junction with the entrance to Inverness Royal Academy to its junction with Culduthel Road, from 10.40 hours to 10.50 hours on Sunday.Culduthel Road, Inverness closed at its junction with Culduthel Avenue to its roundabout junction with the 88082 Inverness Southern Distributor Road, from 10.40 hours to 10.50 hours on Sunday.B8082 Inverness Southern Distributor Road, closed at its roundabout junction with Culduthel Road to its roundabout junction with the C16 Inverness-Ashie Moor road, from 10.40 hours to 10.55 hours on Sunday.C16 Inverness-Ashie Moor road closed at its junction with Holm Road, Inverness to its junction with the C10 Torbreck Road, from 10.40 hours to 11.30 hours on Sunday.C10 Torbreck Road closed at its junction with the C16 Inverness-Ashie Moor road to its junction with the B862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness Road, from 10.40 hours to 11.45 hours on Sunday.B862 Fort Augustus-Whitebridge-Torness-Dores-Inverness road closed to northbound traffic between its junction with Holm roundabout and its junction with the Ness Bank and Gavell Gardens Road, from 10.00 hours to 16.00 hours on Sunday.

recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car.

There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

They were one of the acts to grace the stage at MOJO last year. Using songs from their EP \u0026#8216The Flood\u0026#8217, they simply blew the crowd away. This year they are ing with new material.Citizen 9 are currently putting their finishing touches to their long-awaited debut album, so keep a look out for it.MOJO kicks off on Saturday October 20 with tickets now available from Argyll Book Centre, Oban Music and Ardfern stores for £8 or £10 at the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert academy makes beautiful music","story":"\t\tChloe TwynhamUpdated: 13/09/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe following piece was written by Tarbert Academy pupil, Chloe TwynhamOn Tuesday September 4, three members of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra , including Alison Mitchell on principal flute and Felix Tanner on viola, came to Tarbert Academy for a day of composition.The day was for senior pupils studying Higher and Advanced Higher Music, with were senior pupils from Lochgilphead and Islay joining.The theme was American Minimalism, with the introductory session demonstrating and participating in its techniques. As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way.

Last October, the Post reported how devastated cancer patients would have to travel up to 100 miles for le-saving chemotherapy as the axe falls on the treatment at Ayr Hospital. And it could take them three hours to travel from the Carrick area like the village of Ballantrae to Crosshouse in Kilmarnock as hospital chiefs push ahead with plans to centralise services. A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":null,"title":"sign-up-for-deaf-comedy-tour-as-two-borders-dates-revealed","story":"AFTER a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe, a two-time Scottish Comedian of the Year finalist is heading to the Borders.\nRay Bradshaw will take his critically acclaimed stand up show Deaf Comedy Fam on a four-month UK tour, which includes a two stops in the region, one at Peebles\u0026rsquo Eastgate Theatre on October 4, and another at Galashiels\u0026rsquo MacArts Centre on November 2.\nAround one in six people suffer from hearing loss, two of those people are Ray\u0026rsquos parents.\u0026nbsp\nRay\u0026rsquos show presents a first for stand-up comedy.\nHe tells his stories in English as well as his first language, British Sign Language.\u0026nbsp\nGrowing up with deaf parents, Ray has many hilarious and eye-opening tales to share \u0026ndash including the time he learned that Santa wasn\u0026rsquot deaf.\nDubbed as a \u0026ldquotruly unique show, the gig represents a desire of Ray\u0026rsquos to make the world of comedy more accessible for deaf people \u0026ndash  only to take the pressure off himself when it comes to making his parents laugh.\u0026nbsp\nDeaf Comedy Fam debuted at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival and completely sold out, before moving to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for a critically-acclaimed, fully sold out run.\u0026nbsp\nRay has numerous radio credits under his belt with BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, has supported Irish comedian Ardal O\u0026rsquoHanlon on his recent tour and is a regular guest on Frankie Boyle and Friends.\nHaving launched his comedy career in 2008, Bradshaw has quickly established himself as one of the brightest and most exciting acts on the UK comedy circuit.\u0026nbsp\nA two-time Scottish Comedian of the Year finalist, Bradshaw had a sell-out run with I Dare Ray To\u0026hellip in 2015, as well as two sell-out seasons at Adelaide Fringe in 2015 and 2016.\u0026nbsp\nIn the past year, he has performed at Adelaide Fringe, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Singapore Fringe and the Kuala Lumpur Comedy Carnival.\nFor Ray\u0026rsquos performance at the Eastgate, tickets are \u0026pound15, \u0026pound13, \u0026pound6 for under 15s and can be bought at \nwww.eastgatearts\n.\nFor his show at Galashiels\u0026rsquos MacArts visit \nwww.ticketsource/macarts\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"double-delight-as-us-and-oz-come-together-at-st-boswells-live","story":"LATER this month St Boswells Live will be hosting a sublime event co-headlined between Aussie and resident Borderer Jenny Biddle, and USA west coast performer John Craigie.\nBoth of them are consummate songwriters and musicians, telling tales ranging from the heartbreaking to the outright hilarious, each in their own very dferent styles.\nIf Tracy Chapman married Joni Mitchell but then had a saucy love affair with Ani Dranco, you\u0026rsquod get Jenny Biddle.\nWith six albums under her belt and an iTunes chart-topping single, indie folk/blues songsmith, Jenny wraps herself around her guitar, and like a marriage between body and instrument, she commands her instrument to talk \u0026ldquowith uncommon skill and absolute self-assurance .\nHer audience is compelled to join her on a voyage of passion and story in song.\nAcoustic guitar-maker, proficient pianist, recovering chocoholic, and harmonica squawker, our Aussie singer is now based in sunny Scotland, touring internationally, and practising the art of making a woodstove fire with wet wood.\nFor this evening Jenny will be recording a live album which the audience will be a part of, something truly not to be missed.\nJenny explained why she relocated to the Scottish Borders: I\" moved over for love -

relocating to Paris in 1991, he began to specialise in the design of \u0027deceptively simple-looking mass-produced objects\u0027.\nAnd there has been a steady flow of awards for his technology and

is ever changing in its appearance, depending from where it is viewed.\nAnd it breaks the mould of monotonous forms that normally characterise this kind of central lamp.\nAs well as hanging in the new

very best of what the Scottish Borders has to serve up.\nBetween a food fayre, chef demonstrations and charity dinner, there was something for everyone to appreciate across the Local Food on Local Plates theme.\nKicking off the series, which took place during Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight, was a food fayre held at the Scottish Borders Campus.\nA total of 16 local producers and suppliers exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising in allergy aware products.\nThomas and Ethel now operates on a wholesale basis from a unit at Tweedbank, priding itself on the bakery\u0026rsquos gluten free guarantee with items prepared in a completely safe environment.\nThe company is now aiming to supply to Morrison\u0026rsquos, as well as having been named runner-up wholesale bakery in The Scottish Food Awards 2018.\nBusiness students got involved in helping the stallholders to promote their goods, with one explaining on behalf of Caverton Mill Farm that the blueberries available for purchase had been picked only two days prior, making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which was founded in Coldstream and now has its head office in Nottingham.\nRichard White of Freewheelin\u0026rsquo Brewery, makes the most of collaborating with local business.\nThe community owned brewery is hosted by the Peebles Hydro Hotel \u0026amp Spa, where the beer is stocked in the bar as well as being available for hotel guests to take home, making the brewery a unique visitor attraction.\nRichard was pleased to support the College food fayre, commenting that it was a great business networking opportunity as well as helping to raise the profile of the four old company.\nHot Sauce, produced in Nether Huntlywood near Earlston, is sold in delicatessens across the Borders, but the company is also reaping the rewards of e-commerce \u0026ndash not only are online customers their third largest customer base, they have shipped orders as far as Australia and New Zealand, opening up their product to a worldwide audience.\nAnd, Charlie Beaumont, Tourism Manager at The Borders Distillery in Hawick, quipped that they had brought \u0026lsquolocal gin in local glasses\u0026rsquo to the Local Food on Local Plates event.\nH added: \"We are really proud that our gin is

Firebrick Brasserie, Lauder, Iain Gourlay of Cringletie House Hotel, Peebles, and a joint demonstration by Jonny Millar of The Townhouse Hotel, Melrose and Craig Gibb of the neighbouring Burts Hotel provided sold-out chef demonstrations.\nThe catering and hospitality students themselves benefitted from the demonstrations, where Jacqueline taught one group how to make puff candy and butterscotch sauce, and the students learned some new cookery techniques shown by the chefs.\nThe students also took the chance to showcase their own developing skills by serving light lunches and refreshments to customers from their barista bar throughout the day.\nJacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell ed the following day to host a very special charity dinner in the College Restaurant.\nTicketholders included members of local industry and College staff, amongst other food enthusiasts keen to experience a meal cooked by the reputable chef.\nJacqueline herself was supported by willing and able students from all three levels of Catering and Hospitality programmes, keen to add to their skillsets and experience.\nLevel 2 student Rebecca Sharpe was delighted to experience working with The Sisters Restaurant chef. She said: \u0026ldquoIt has given us a bit more experience and tips on how to prepare dferent ingredients, such as peeling hazelnuts.\nLevel 3 student Erin McAleer added: \u0026ldquoI feel like the dinner went really well, and it helped to enhance the skills I\u0026rsquom currently learning at College.\nMoney raised went to the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland , which provides support to a number of Borders College staff and students through craft scholarships, enabling them to enhance specic areas within their unique skillsets and to further develop their careers.\nCollege Principal Angela Cox highlighted that HIT Scotland\u0026rsquos mission chimes with that of Borders College in helping people to achieve their potential.\nDinner guests were served a smorgasbord of starters followed by a delicious lamb main course and trio of desserts, all created using local produce, many of which were purchased from food fayre exhibitors.\nChef Jacqueline said: \"Tonight\u0026rsquos menu came together under the Local Food on Local Plates brief, in collaboration with Borders College staff and students.

Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217

the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217

championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

The stage is nothing new for the former Centre Stage director. She left the theatre group in 2016 to give herself \u0026ldquoa wee chance and still acts in local productions.  She now runs Quirky Pond, a theatre company, with friend Yvonne Rowley. Their next show is The Naked Truth, running on November 2 and 3.  \u0026ldquoQuirky Pond is getting bigger and bigger, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe Naked Truth will have two days at The Brunton [in Musselburgh].  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about five women who take up pole dancing classes, for a iety of reasons. One of the characters finds out she has cancer, so she wants to have a fundraiser.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a mix between Calendar Girls and The Full Monty but we all keep our clothes on.  But Debs still keeps an eye on Centre Stage with everything else going on.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove offered to help  they need me but I think they\u0026rsquore doing quite well themselves, she said.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom going to try and get to their panto this year.  \u0026ldquoNext year is their 40th year, so it\u0026rsquos a big anniversary for them.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled. It is now proposed to reinstate a modern silo on this side to increase rail capacity.  Oliver Curtin, Dunbar Cement Plant manager, was pleased that permission had been granted, with further permissions to be secured before work gets under way, with staff levels to remain the same.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore pleased that East Lothian Council has approved our application to upgrade the facilities at Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThe plans will allow us to bring the latest technology to our operations, build on our offer to customers and maximise use of the rail network for transportation across Scotland and England.  \u0026ldquoWe will now work with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to secure appropriate operating permits.  \u0026ldquoOnce the necessary environmental permissions are in place, we will create a detailed plan for construction and operational timescales."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-pub-named-scotlands-best","story":"  The Volunteer Arms, known as Staggs, has been named\u0026nbspthe best pub in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.

Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

The runners \u0026ndash Jenner\u0026rsquos sister Susan Gibson, along with the late minister\u0026rsquos daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace, and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess, as well as Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry and Kara\u0026rsquos husband Duncan \u0026ndash have been raising funds throughout the summer in aid of Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre.  Jenner died on March 2, aged 63, having been minister of St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.  Susan, who takes on the Scottish 10k \u0026ndash which starts and finishes in Musselburgh on Sunday \u0026ndash alongside Duncan, said: \u0026ldquoWe are completely blown away by the generosity we have come across. It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.  Already the family have completed three events, with Elaine, 33, running the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen in May. Then Elaine lined up alongside Clare, 32, Kara, 29, Duncan, 28, and Susan for the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, in July.  The youngest members of the squad did their bit at the parkrun in Portrush, Northern Ireland, with Susan joined by Laura, 37, eight-year-old Isla, 14-year-old Ciara and Elaine.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.  Now the runners are in the home straight and each of them has been overwhelmed by the generosity of members of the public.  Initially a fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 was set before that was increased to \u0026pound3,000, but both figures have been smashed.  Susan added: \u0026ldquoI think the challenge itself was original and caught people\u0026rsquos imagination but the total is not because of us.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of what Jenner was to so many people.

Mr McDonnell announced plans for \u0026ldquoinclusive ownership funds  at the TUC congress in Manchester earlier this month, telling union leaders they would give workers \u0026ldquoa say in the management and direction of their company.  In his keynote speech to Labour\u0026rsquos conference in Liverpool on Monday, he will pledge that workers will also receive idend payments direct from the fund.  Under Labour\u0026rsquos plans \u0026ndash set to feature in the party\u0026rsquos next election manesto \u0026ndash legislation would require private sector companies with 250 or more employees to transfer at least 1% of their ownership into an IOF each year, up to a maximum of 10%. Smaller companies would be able to set up an IOF on a voluntary basis.  Labour calculates that 40% of the private sector workforce \u0026ndash some 10.7 million people \u0026ndash will initially be covered by the scheme. Dividend payouts will be made at a flat rate to all employees of the firm.  The funds will be held and managed collectively and their shares cannot be sold or traded. Workers\u0026rsquo fund representatives will have voting rights in companies\u0026rsquo decision-making processes in the same way as other shareholders.  Aides said the creation of the funds would go some way to redressing growing inequalities after a decade when average pay has not increased in real terms.  But the idend payments will not be available to state employees \u0026ndash including workers in industries such as water after they are nationalised under Labour\u0026rsquos plans.  The \u0026pound2 billion social idend fund would ensure that public sector workers and employees of smaller firms also benefit from what Labour terms a \u0026ldquobroadening of ownership in our economy, said party sources.  Mr McDonnell will tell the Liverpool gathering:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWorkers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the s that it makes.  \u0026ldquoThe evidence shows that employee ownership increases a company\u0026rsquos productivity and encourages long-term thinking.  He will say:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe shareholding will give workers the same rights as other shareholders to have a say over the direction of their company.  \u0026ldquoAnd idend payments will be made directly to the workers from the fund.  \u0026ldquoThe idend payments workers will receive will be up to \u0026pound500 a year. That\u0026rsquos 11 million workers each with a greater say, and a greater stake, in the rewards of their labour.  Spelling out the thinking behind the social idend, Mr McDonnell will say: \u0026ldquoWe all know it\u0026rsquos not just the workers of a company that create the profits it generates.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the collective investment that we as a society make that enables entrepreneurs to build and grow their businesses, maintaining the roads and investing in the infrastructure we rely upon, educating the workforce, caring for them when they\u0026rsquore sick and investing in the research and development that enables technological innovation.  \u0026ldquoSo we believe it\u0026rsquos right that we all share in the benefits that investment produces.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why a proportion of revenues generated by the inclusive ownership funds will be transferred back to our public services as a social idend.  \u0026ldquoMobilising billions that could be spent directly on the social security system which supports those who have retired, are unable to work, or need society\u0026rsquos support in other ways.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"nearly-30000-people-visit-the-va-dundee-in-its-first-week","story":"  Including the audience for the 3D festival, which signalled the opening of the museum, more than 50,000 people took part in the first week of the new \u0026pound80m museum.  Around 6,000 people attended the opening weekend of the Kengo Kuma-designed design museum, and from last Saturday to Friday, 27,201 people visited in total.  On the eve of the museum\u0026rsquos official opening 10,000 people gathered to enjoy headliners Primal Scream and a special light and sound installation, and on Saturday 15 September, the 3D Festival continued and was attended by another 12,600 people.  The plan for the museum expects that 500,000 people will visit in the first year, a number which will reduce to around 300,000 in the following years: so those far the attendance figures have got off to a good start.  The latter total would put it on a par with the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh or the People\u0027s Palace in Glasgow, according to figures from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions.  V\u0026ampA Dundee, with an annual budget of \u0026pound4.5m, will stage large scale exhibitions from the V\u0026ampA in London as well as design museums from across the world.  It has a permanent and free Scottish Design Gallery, as well as a large exhibition space for paid-for shows, the first being Ocean Liners.  Philip Long, director of V\u0026ampA Dundee, said: \"V\u0026ampA Dundee officially opened its doors last Saturday and since then more than 27,000 people have explored this wonderful building and its fantastic galleries.  \"Kengo Kuma, the architect who designed V\u0026ampA Dundee, wanted the museum to become a new living room for the city and it\u0026rsquos been a joy to watch people from Dundee and further afield make themselves at home.  \"As well as museum visitors, we have also celebrated the opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee with the 22,600 people who joined us for the 3D Festival.\"  He added: \"It\u0026rsquos been a very busy week, and I\u0026rsquod like to thank everybody who has helped us celebrate this historic moment and all those who came to V\u0026ampA Dundee during our opening week.  \"We\u0026rsquore very much looking forward to welcoming even more visitors to the museum.\"  As well as the official visitors after its opening, last Friday, more than 2000 people had a \"sneak peek\" tour, including school children, teachers, those who had taken part in V\u0026ampA Dundee pre-opening learning projects and members of local community groups.  The two press preview days held in the lead up to the museum opening were attended by around 300 journalists from across the world.  V\u0026ampA Dundee is free to enter and is now open daily.  At the opening of the museum, Mr Long said that the expectations for visitors had been planned \"prudently\".  He added: \"What is very clear to us, is that this is a project that needs to work locally, it needs to work nationally, and we want to bring an international audience.  \"Within a 60 to 90 minute drive there are 750,000 people, and  you go beyond that, then it quickly goes over one million people.  \"There is a particular asset that we have - our relationship with the V\u0026ampA in Dundee.  \"That means we can continue to bring great exhibitions.

In 2017, the Wings Over Scotland blog - run by Stuart Campbell, who is popular among the crankier elements of the pro-independence community - tweeted an objectionable comment which mentioned gay Tory MP David Mundell.  Kezia Dugdale, at that point the leader of Scottish Labour, used her column in the Daily Record to accuse the blogger of \u0026ldquohomophobic tweets. Wings is suing the MSP for \u0026pound25,000 in damages.  CATCH UP: Labour MSPs urged to help Dugdale with legal costs  UK Labour agreed to meet her legal costs - over \u0026pound90,000 so far - and instructed lawyers to contest the action. Out of the blue, new party general secretary Jennie Formby is said to have changed her mind and Ms Dugdale has been abandoned. Scottish Labour members are furious.  It is hard to find anyone in the party who does not sympathise with Ms Dugdale, particularly given who is she up against. Fans of Bath-based Wings believe he exposes unionist untruths and calls out the so-called \"mainstream media\". He tries to take apart negative stories on the SNP and rarely criticises the Nationalist administration in Edinburgh.  The pro-Government blogger is, without doubt, Somerset\u0026rsquos most influential voice on Scottish politics and has raised over \u0026pound500,000 from his devotees. But he is loathed by opponents who believe he has lowered the tone of politics. For the average Scottish Labour activist, the court case is about more than the rights and wrongs of a tweet.  It is also true that Ms Dugdale, through her own actions, does not have much credit left in the Corbyn favour bank. She has positioned herself as a critic of the UK leader and has not been noticeably supportive of her successor, Richard Leonard. That Ms Formby felt able to cut her loose was telling.  Ms Dugdale is also regarded as self-centred. She may have misgivings about the Corbynista takeover of her party, but the only reason Mr Leonard is leader is because she bailed out after two years. Her former allies share the same view: she left her party, and her staff, in the lurch. The only thing she gave Labour was its worst ever election results.  Her post-leadership decisions have also irked colleagues. When at the helm, Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos party promised a crackdown on second jobs by MSPs. After her resignation, she jetted off to Australia to appear on a third-rate celebrity TV show, for which she was paid \u0026pound70,000. It is little wonder that some in the party believe she, not them, should pay her legal fees.  But internal party gripes should play no part in assessing the UK Labour decision, which even Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos critics believe is as unfathomable as it is unjust.  It is not just the shaky morality of withdrawing legal support half way through a court case that rankles with Labour members. Or the insensitive way it was carried out, which appears to confirm the perception of Scottish Labour as little more than a branch office. Or the certainty that Labour would bankroll Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos costs  he ever faced a similar problem.  Imagine how this could play out. Ms Dugdale limps along, sustained by a patchwork of crowdfunded donations and hand outs from colleagues, and loses the case. She then has to pay damages and Wings\u0026rsquo legal fees. She could face bankruptcy.  Mr Campbell, who is never slow to wind up his Unionist opponents, would no doubt see it as a victory over Labour, not just Ms Dugdale. He would be emboldened and bullet proof. And all this would have been aided by the UK party.  If you are a Labour supporter, Dugdale on a bad day is surely better than Wings over Scotland on any day. If Leonard wants to assert his authority as leader, perhaps he should call Formby again and remind her of the meaning of solidarity."},{"url":null,"title":"first-ministers-advisers-blamed-for-her-caution-on-backing-final-brexit-referendum","story":"  The insider, speaking on condition of anonymity, said key members of Sturgeon\u0026rsquos top team were worried about the impact a new vote would have on another independence referendum.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who last week urged the SNP leader to back a \u0026ldquopeople\u0026rsquos vote on Brexit, said: \u0026ldquoHer special advisers seem to have a vice-like grip on the First Minister.  \"It would be wise for Nicola Sturgeon to talk to others and to open her mind to the best way of keeping our country in the EU.  Sturgeon has delayed revealing her intentions for a second independence referendum due to what she regards as a lack of detail on the UK\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU.  The First Minister is expected to provide an update once a fuller picture emerges from the negotiations between Prime Minister Theresa May and EU representatives.  However, a number of senior SNP figures believe a second independence referendum will not occur before 2021 because May will refuse to sanction another vote. These figures want Sturgeon to instead throw her weight behind the cross-party campaign for a referendum on Brexit.  Senior nationalists believe backing this short-term move would put the SNP on the side of the majority of Scots, while also reaching out to Remainers who are hostile to independence.  Advocates of this approach also believe that, by shting her constitutional position in this way, Sturgeon would give herself breathing room on independence and space to reboot the case for independence.  It is understood Cabinet Secretary Michael Russell, as well as SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, are open to another Brexit referendum, while Sturgeon herself is said to interested, but she has only offered qualied support.  A senior source close to the Government said the First Minister\u0026rsquos special advisers \u0026ndash the political appointees who work for ministers \u0026ndash are sceptical and Sturgeon is being \u0026ldquoheld back.  The insider said two of her most influential \u0026ldquospads \u0026ndash chief of staff Liz Lloyd and constitutional adviser Ewan Crawford \u0026ndash are not convinced by the policy.  Some doubters are said to be worried that backing another Brexit vote would create a precedent for a \u0026ldquodouble referendum on independence: one on the principle, and another on a final deal.  However, SNP supporters of another Brexit vote point to a recent report by the Constitution Unit which they believe should allay these concerns.  The report recommended that, in cases where a Government produced a White Paper outlining a change to be offered in a referendum, a further plebiscite would only be triggered  there was a \u0026ldquomaterial departure from the original prospectus.  Asked by Rennie last week about a final vote on Brexit, Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoIf Willie Rennie wants me to be an enthusiastic advocate of such a vote, let him explain to me how it would guarantee that we will not simply find ourselves in the same position we found ourselves in June 2016, when Scotland voted to remain in the EU but the rest of the United Kingdom voted to leave.  \u0026ldquoIf he can explain right now how Scotland is guaranteed that it will not find itself in that position, I am happy to talk to him further about the matter.  She added: \u0026ldquoIf I am to get enthusiastically behind the campaign for another EU vote, surely it is not unreasonable to ask for a guarantee that Scotland would not find itself in that position all over again.  \u0026ldquoThe fact of the matter is that Willie Rennie and others campaigning for a people\u0026rsquos vote are unable to give that guarantee.  \u0026ldquoIf they are prepared to give such a guarantee, I am happy to get behind the campaign.  Ian Murray, Labour MP for Edinburgh South, said: \u0026ldquoI wrote to Nicola Sturgeon asking her to join the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign, and it\u0026rsquos deeply disappointing that she has declined to do so.  \u0026ldquoShe needs to put the country before the narrow interests of her own party and her independence crusade.  \u0026ldquoThe People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign is a cross-party group including Labour, Tories, LibDems and Greens. If the First Minister truly is committed to fighting against a hard Brexit then she will join us failure to do so will confirm that she is only interested in grievance \u0026ndash again, a political party putting its ideology before the country.  A spokesperson for the First Minister said: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister has repeatedly made clear, the SNP will not stand in the way of a second EU referendum \u0026ndash but those advocating it need to explain how they would guarantee that we will not simply find ourselves in the same position we found ourselves in June 2016, when Scotland voted to remain in the EU but the rest of the United Kingdom voted to leave.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to discussions with the campaign on any suggestions they may have to address that flaw in their current proposals.\"  The spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWith it now looking increasingly likely that the choice facing the UK will be between a no-deal Brexit or a blind Brexit, an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge \u0026ndash and allow all alternative options to be considered."},{"url":null,"title":"tribute-journey-to-saviour-of-the-flying-scotsman","story":"  The Flying Scotsman epitomises the golden age of steam, a remarkable combination of grace and power, the first locomotive to break the 100mph speed barrier and, precisely 90 years ago this year, the first to charge non-stop between London and Edinburgh.  That impressive city-to-city journey of 1928 would be revisited 50 years ago this year, in 1968, by the man who rescued her from the scrapyard a charismatic, mutton-chopped maverick who had fallen headfirst into a lelong love affair with Britain\u0026rsquos most famous locomotive when he was just four years old.  Alan Pegler \u0026ndash who called the Flying Scotsman his \u0026lsquoold girl\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash died in 2012. Having invested a fortune in the love of his le, he ended up bankrupt, his beautul machine tottering once again on the brink of being smashed to pieces, only this time in America.  Of course, the story would have a happy ending \u0026ndash today the Flying Scotsman is a national treasure.  And soon, this spectacular coal-powered titan of the train tracks will set off on another remarkable journey, one that bring Pegler\u0026rsquos love affair with her to a conclusion and pay the greatest of respects to the man whose lelong devotion helped save her for generations to come.  On Saturday, October 13, the Flying Scotsman will set off from London Kings Cross bound for York, with hundreds of passengers who have paid between \u0026pound150 and \u0026pound330 for the  journey.  Moments after she has conquered the steep incline of Stoke Bank near Grantham, in Lincolinshire, just at the point where in 1934 she hit 100mph and made history, Pegler\u0026rsquos ashes will be respectfully tipped into the engine\u0026rsquos firebox.  Saviour and the queen of steam will become one \u0026ndash just as he wanted.  It will be a poignant and fitting tribute to a remarkable man whose passion for the elegant lines and powerful heart of the Sir Nigel Gresley designed Pacic LNER A-3 class locomotive ensured one of the world\u0026rsquos best-known steam engines would not be allowed to die.  Pegler first set eyes on her at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, when he was a wide-eyed boy. Apple green, 70ft long and weighing 97 tonnes, her curves and imposing presence made an impression that lasted his entire le.  \u0026ldquoHe loved the Flying Scotsman, says his daughter Penny. \u0026ldquoShe was standing there, gleaming and beautully clean. He was lted up to the cab this tiny little child and this wonderful engine.  \u0026ldquoThat was the spark.  Built in Doncaster two years earlier at a cost of under \u0026pound8000, she ploughed the line between Edinburgh Waverley and London King\u0026rsquos Cross that was first established in 1862 as the \u0026lsquoSpecial Scotch Express\u0026rsquo route.  Already a crowd-pleaser thanks to Gresley\u0026rsquos genius design, the Flying Scotsman entered the record books in May 1928 when a new type of tender fitted with a corridor allowed a replacement crew to take over without having to stop \u0026ndash enabling the first ever non-stop London to Edinburgh service.  Six years later she clocked 100mph. Never mind that No.3440 City of Truro probably did it before her, the Flying Scotsman\u0026rsquos run was official.  A string of shrewd marketing ideas placed her at the cutting edge of technology. In 1929 she starred in British cinema\u0026rsquos first talkie called, naturally, The Flying Scotsman.  In 1932 her crew spoke by telephone to the pilot of an Imperial Airways Heracles as it flew overhead, plane and locomotive powering north at 90 mph.  And the following year she raced along a two-mile track beside the river Ouse in Cambridgeshire, as a speedboat and plane attempted to outrun her. Naturally, she won.  She became a World War Two workhorse, her livery painted matt black in defiance of the Nazi threat.  But by 1963 and with diesel now replacing steam power, she was deemed surplus to requirements.  Pegler, a Nottinghamshire-born war-time bomber pilot and heir to an industrial fortune, was among the many who felt she deserved to be saved.  And a conversation in Leith, Edinburgh would give him the push to do it.  \u0026ldquoThe Flying Scotsman was a bit of a faded star by this time, says Bob Gwynne, associate curator at the National Railway Museum in York. \u0026ldquoAnd she wasn\u0026rsquot on the list of engines which the state wanted to preserve.  \u0026ldquoRamsay Ferguson, joint secretary of the Save our Steam group and Gressley A3 Preservation Society was living in Edinburgh, and met Pegler at Trinity House in Leith.  \u0026ldquoHe wanted to save her, and must have told him that they didn\u0026rsquot have the money to buy the Flying Scotsman. But, of course, he did.  Pegler, who had already saved the doomed Ffestiniog Railways in Wales \u0026ndash now a major tourist attraction \u0026ndash spent \u0026pound3000 to buy the locomotive he\u0026rsquod loved since a boy, then ploughed in thousands more for restoration work.  Proud of his new toy, he organised a patriotic tour of the United States to show her off which included a Sir Winston Churchill lookalike, tartan miniskirt clad models and actors dressed in Shakespearean garb. It boosted the locomotive\u0026rsquos profile even further and celebrated British engineering at a time when America was sending men to the moon.  It was such a success, that despite no longer having UK government support, Pegler decided to stage a second tour.  \u0026ldquoIt was like the best gap year, recalls Penny, who was 17 at the time, and joined the Flying Scotsman as she powered through the Rockies, from eastern Canada to San Francisco. \u0026ldquoHe was having a great time.  But it was expensive fun. And by the time they reached Calornia, her father was bankrupt. Cleverly, he arranged for the Flying Scotsman to be stored within a US Army compound, guaranteeing creditors couldn\u0026rsquot claim her for scrap.  Pegler\u0026rsquos grand affair was heading for orce. Back in the UK, Scots construction firm boss Sir William McAlpine stepped in with \u0026pound25,000 to save her for a second time, and shipped her home via the Panama Canal.  Penny recalls crowds gathering to cheer her on as she arrived in Liverpool and steamed her way to Derby, just a few scratches to her famous livery to show for her trauma.  But by the early 2000s, she again required major attention. Sir William had teamed up with fellow steam enthusiast and record producer Pete Waterman, but costs spiralled and she was sold for \u0026pound1.5m to Derbyshire businessman and scientist Tony Marchington.  His plans to create a Flying Scotsman Village in Edinburgh, met with a giant \u0026lsquothumbs down\u0026rsquo from councillors and his finances took a hit. With her again fate in the balance, a National Lottery grant and donation from Sir Richard Branson saved her for the nation.  As for her saviour Pegler, four times married and his fortune blown on his love of steam, he performed songs and talks for his passage back from America and went on to work on the Orient Express and InterCity\u0027s land cruises. He was made an OBE in 2006, and died six years later, aged 91.  Next month\u0026rsquos Alan Pegler Farewell outing will see his family join steam enthusiasts in plush carriages pulled by the locomotive he adored, for a final journey which he meticulously planned \u0026ndash even down to the exact spot at which his ashes are to become one with his beloved \u0026lsquoold girl\u0026rsquo.  The ups and downs of pursuing his great love held no regrets, recalls Penny. \u0026ldquoIt was a dream for him.  \u0026ldquoTo really live your dreams is a wonderful thing, she says. \u0026ldquoSo many of us have dreams but do nothing about it, my dad did.  Adds Gwynne: \u0026ldquoHe was effectively seduced by this engine and by the experiences he was having.  \u0026ldquoHe had the time of his le."},{"url":null,"title":"how-jfks-speech-in-the-beresford-in-glasgow-delayed-the-us-involvement-in-wwii","story":"  But when John F Kennedy got up to speak, it wasn\u0027t within the ivy-clad walls of Hard, or a community hall in Massachusetts, but the ballroom of a hotel in Glasgow.  And instead of the adoring applause and cheers which would one day greet the idealistic young Senator as he campaigned for the presidency, he was greeted with considerable anger by US citizens fearing for their lives.  It was 79 years ago this month that the young Kennedy, then aged 22, made his way to Scotland at the behest of his father, Joseph Kennedy, then the US Ambassador to Great Britain.  War had just broken out with Nazi Germany, and the young Kennedy was dispatched on a special diplomatic mission to ensure there was no fallout after a U-boat torpedoed the Govan-built passenger liner Athenia as it sailed Glasgow to Montreal on 3 September 1939.  The sinking, one of the first hostile acts of the war, cost the lives of 117 people onboard - 28 of them American - and had heightened the chances that America would be dragged into the war.  Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, an American isolationist, was determined this would not happen and sent his son to turn on the charm and sooth the nerves of traumatised survivors who had been brought to the Art Deco Beresford Hotel in Glasgow\u0027s Sauchiehall Street as part of the relief effort..  Phillips O\u0027Brien, Professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews University said: \"The Athenia was one of the first ships sunk at the outbreak of the war and the shock would have been immense.  \"It was very early on, during the phoney war, and Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador, would have wanted to act quickly to show to the US citizens caught up in the sinking that their government was looking out for them.  \"Joseph Kennedy was a colourful character and was isolationist towards American involvement in the war. He wanted to act quickly to make things were smoothed over.\"  Many of the 1400 Athenia passengers, which included hundreds of women and children, were rescued from the sea off Northern Ireland.  Patrick Dollan, Glasgow\u0027s Lord Provost at the time organised the relief effort personally and even launched a special fund for the survivors, which raised more than \u0026pound3500.  In a telegram to the US President Franklin D Roosevelt sent on 5 September, he assured that \"Glasgow will look after American and other survivors of [the] Athenia disaster who have arrived in our city.\"  This prompted President Roosevelt to write to Provost Dollan in response on 11 September, saying: \"I wish you to know how deeply I and the American people appreciate the efficient, generous and humane manner in which Glasgow and its citizens came to the help of our fellow countrymen and women in their need.  \"I express to you my heartfelt thanks and assure you that Glasgow\u0027s gesture will not be forgotten.\"  When the young JFK arrived in Scotland, he also quickly showed his appreciation of Provost Dollan\u0027s efforts, accompanying him to a meeting in the City Chambers and visiting survivors in hospital.  Kennedy said at the time: \u0026ldquoI have never seen people more grateful for all that has been done for them by Glasgow than those to whom I have spoken today.  \u0026ldquoI have told Lord Provost Dollan that it is the desire of the American government to undertake complete responsibility for the care of our nationals but he has insisted that Glasgow regards it as its privilege to undertake this responsibility. That is a very generous gesture indeed and it will be fully appreciated by my countrymen.  \u0026ldquoI will go back and tell my father how kind you have been to our people.  But when Kennedy was taken to the the Beresford Hotel to meet with around 150 American survivors, some of them wounded, the mood turned ugly.  Demands were made for protection from the US navy for any further crossings of the Atlantic, with many people fearing further German attacks.  A newspaper report from 8 September said: \u0026ldquoSeveral women shouted \u0026ldquoWe must have a convoy, we are not going in a small freighter without a convoy. You can\u0026rsquot trust the Germans now\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoWe want an armed escort,\u0026rsquo shouted another woman who had a bandage around her head. Mr Kennedy, obviously taken aback by the display of feeling in the meeting said he would report to his father on a suggestion of a convoy,  There was also said to be anger at the arrival of the ambassador\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash dubbed the \u0026ldquoschoolboy diplomat \u0026ndash whose fresh-faced looks made him seem even younger and more inexperienced than his 22 years.  But he was able to remain calm and reassured them that they would be safe and ultimately persuading them to travel.  With the crowd mollied and less likely to voice their outrage over the attack when they ed home, the sinking of the Athenia did not prove to be the catalyst which drove the US to war.  Conversely, it was to prove a rallying cry in Canada, which also lost a number of its citizens, spurring many men to enlist.  Among the casualties of the sinking was 10-year-old Canadian girl Margaret Hayworth, whose fate was widely covered by the newspapers, setting their tone for the rest of the war. One thousand people met the train that brought her body back to Hamilton, Ontario.  However, the truth about the sinking was obscured in Germany, where Hitler decided to dampen down publicity to avoid stoking American outrage.  Officially, it was denied that the Athenia had been torpedoed by a German U-Boat, and records were altered to cover up the incident with the truth only emerging during the Nuremberg trials.  JFK ed to Hard and would later enlist in the US Navy, serving on a torpedo boat in the Pacic.  He was injured when the boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, and had to survive for several days behind enemy lines.  After the war he became active in politics, entering the House of Representatives in 1947 and advancing to the US Senate in 1953. He was elected President in 1961, and assassinated two years later in Texas.  The Beresford Hotel, which opened in 1938, was turned into an office block after the war, and later bought by the University of Strathclyde for student accommodation in 1964, renaming it Baird Hall.  It was sold in 2003 and work began on its re-conversion into private apartments.  Prof O\u0027Brien, said that the JFK\u0027s trip there would have been part of his father\u0027s efforts to limit the damage to America\u0027s interests caused by the sinking of the Athenia, giving the young JFK an introduction to the world of poltical spin.  He said: \"John Kennedy - JFK - was the second son and it was his older brother Joe who was being groomed to be president. But Joe died during the war undertaking a very dangerous bombing mission, and John was next in line.  \"Their father was politically driven to his finger tips and wanted to get someone up to Glasgow to ensure there was no bad press and that the American government came out of it ok.  \"As John was in London at the time, he would have been used to make the diplomatic point that the US government was on top of things.\""},{"url":null,"title":"why-google-is-a-modern-mans-god","story":"  THE REPUBLIC OF GOOGLE  LARRY Page wants to live forever. Such an ambition should come as no surprise.  This is the man, after all, who, aged just 23, woke up from a dream that he could \"download the whole web\" and then went on to found Google, a company which celebrates its 20th birthday this week and is seen by many as more of a modern-day god than a corporation.  Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast And Break Things, a book which charts the power of the world\u0026rsquos biggest tech giants, including Google, says Page is truly in \u0026ldquopursuit of everlasting le.  Taplin adds: \u0026ldquoObviously the treatment would be extremely expensive and only available for the very rich. For the whole of history, the less well-off have at least comforted themselves with the thought that death was even handed \u0026ndash even John D Rockefeller was not going to be able to buy off the Grim Reaper.  Aside from extending the span of human existence, Page\u0026rsquos other dreams are pretty god-like too: one of his goals is to develop a miniature smartphone that hooks directly into your brain, another is to mine asteroids, and a third is to create flying cars \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos already invested hundreds of millions in the idea.  His biggest dream, however, might give more pause for thought than such sci-fi fantasies, because Page also wants to change the very nature of democracy and government.  Balaji Srinivasan, a powerful venture capitalist following in Page\u0026rsquos slipstream, has spoken gleefully of Silicon Valley \u0026ndash where the giant tech companies are based in Calornia \u0026ndash outstripping Washington when it comes to raw power.  \u0026ldquoWe want to show what a society run by Silicon Valley would look like, Srinivasan is quoted as saying in Taplin\u0026rsquos book. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos where \u0026lsquoexit\u0026rsquo comes in \u0026hellip It basically means building an opt-in society, ultimately outside the US, run by technology \u0026hellip Larry Page, for example, wants to set aside a part of the world for unregulated experimentation.  Some think this vision means Google, and corporations like it, becoming effective nations with their own laws. Page, according to Taplin, \u0026ldquohas financed extensive research on privately owned city-states.  Page, then, is a man who wants to build his own nation \u0026hellip and live forever. What kind of man has these dreams? Well, one unhindered by wealth for a start. He\u0026rsquos one of the richest people on Earth with a net-worth of 56 billion \u0026ndash and his company is so cash-rich it literally can\u0026rsquot spend the money it makes.  He and his we  have a 7 million compound at Palo Alto in the Valley, as well as an eco-mansion.  Page also owns Senses \u0026ndash a 194ft super yacht capable of deep sea exploration, complete with helipad.  But what lies under the wealth? The answer is \"a Burner\". Burners are devotees of the Burning Man festival in Nevada. The weekender is the very definition of radical chic \u0026ndash libertarian hippiedom that turns its back on the conventions and values of the rest of society.  Page and his fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin both identy as avid Burners. The first-ever Google Doodle \u0026ndash the animation on Google\u0026rsquos homepage celebrating special events \u0026ndash was created as an \"out of office\" to let the world know the two were off to Burning Man.  But these two Burners, it\u0026rsquos been said, need a lot of \u0026ldquoadult supervision. Court documents relating to a lawsuit over the pair\u0026rsquos Boeing 767 corporate jet \u0026ndash fitted with hammocks and a cocktail bar and known as \"the party plane\" \u0026ndash reveal that the pair lost it with each other over what type of bed should go in it. Google CEO Eric Schmidt \u0026ndash appointed by Page and Brin because he too is a Burner \u0026ndash had to step in.  \u0026ldquoSergey, you can have whatever bed you want in your room Larry, you can have whatever kind of bed you want in your bedroom. Let\u0026rsquos move on, Schmidt told the pair. Page, Brin and Schmidt have eight private jets between them, incidentally.  Bow down and worship  GOOGLE has already changed the world \u0026ndash and your le with it. Professor Scott Galloway of New York University\u0026rsquos business school, a serial tech entrepreneur and author of The Four: The Hidden DNA Of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google, says: \u0026ldquoGoogle is modern man\u0026rsquos god \u0026hellip About one in six queries posed to the search engine have never been asked before. What rabbi, priest, scholar or coach has so much gravitas?  The prayers of the world are being uttered up to Google \u0026ndash then scraped for data and sold on to ad agencies, making the company not just one of the most powerful and richest corporations ever seen on Earth, but an organisation which knows you probably better than you know yourself.  It certainly knows you better than your partner, or parents, or children \u0026ndash would you tell them the things you tell Google? Would you let them see all your searches? Your fears and secrets, your darkest and most vulnerable thoughts?  In fact, some speculate Google might soon be able to guess your thoughts before you think them. Galloway calls this \"precog\" \u0026ndash for precognition. \u0026ldquoThis will come, he says, \u0026ldquowhen a thin layer of AI [articial intelligence] on top of search queries and a few other data streams, including our movements, are used effectively to predict crime, disease and stock prices.  Think of what Google knows about you \u0026ndash it knows your location, your search history, your email, your interests, your friends and family. \u0026ldquoThe temptation to create predictive links between intention and action will be irresistible to governments, hackers and rogue employers, says Galloway.  The creepy line  NATIONAL Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden horried the world when he revealed the NSA was spying on citizens. It later turned out Google, Apple and Facebook had given spooks access to their worldwide networks. Cue outrage.  The anger is ironic, though, for as Taplin points out: \u0026ldquoThe average citizen has voluntarily  turned over to Google and Facebook far more personal information than the government will ever have.  Google\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoprimary business, Taplin says, is \u0026ldquosurveillance marketing \u0026ndash selling our personal information to advertisers for billions of dollars.  The company\u0027s Schmidt once said that it was company policy to \u0026ldquoget right up to the creepy line and not cross it.  In 2014, a study by psychologists at the American Institute for Behavioural Research looked at how Google search rankings for political candidates influence voters. The researchers estimated that \u0026ldquoGoogle could determine the outcome of upwards of 25 per cent of all national elections.  Schmidt once commented: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot need you to type at all. We know where you are are. We know where you\u0026rsquove been. We can more or less know what you\u0026rsquore thinking about.  What was it he was saying about crossing the \"creepy line\"?  The new robber barons  PEOPLE think of Google as a search engine company \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not, it\u0026rsquos a media company. It makes its money selling ads and crushing the opposition.  Apart from state-run broadcasters like the BBC, nearly all other forms of media on the planet depend on ad revenue. Newspapers need ads to hire journalists and print papers, TV stations need ads to make shows and hire staff.  Google took the output of these \"old media\" companies and plundered it \u0026ndash which is why many critics call the Big Tech giants \u0026ldquothe new robber barons.  Who makes more money from a newspaper story online \u0026ndash the newspaper or Google? The answer is Google. Prof Scott Galloway, who was on the board of the New York Times, says that Google and Facebook do a \u0026ldquobetter job extracting value from Times journalists than the management of the Times.  Google destroys old media, says Galloway. \u0026ldquoGoogle not only was crawling content for free, it was also slicing and dicing that content for its users. When people were looking for a hotel in Paris, for example, Google would link to a New York Times travel article on Paris.  \u0026ldquoBut at the top of the page it would place Google\u0026rsquos own ad for the Four Seasons Hotel \u0026hellip Google was also learning \u0026ndash better than the Times itself \u0026ndash exactly what the paper\u0026rsquos readers wanted and were likely to want in the future.  And that meant Google could target those Times readers with far greater precision and make more money from each ad. As much as 10 times more. That meant we were exchanging dollars for dimes.  The parable of the New York Times and Google is replicated across the media. Google cannibalises the old media and monetises it \u0026ndash leaving empty newsrooms and creaking TV stations behind it. This is all before we come to what Google does to art and culture.  Think of YouTube, owned by Google, and all those free movies and documentaries and songs up there \u0026ndash do you think many of the actors or singers or directors get a penny from that? Without culture being paid for there will be no culture.  Giant Monopoly  ITS power has made Google an effective \"public utility\", Galloway says \u0026ndash like the water system or the road network or the electrical grid. It\u0026rsquos also a monopoly, but only Europe has taken this seriously, accusing the company of unfair advantage \u0026ndash perhaps, understandably, given that Google has a 90 per cent share of all EU searches.  Globally, Google has a 92 per cent share of the market, worth 92.4bn. Internet searching on Google is now a bigger business than paper and forestry , construction and engineering , real estate  and gas .  \u0026ldquoHow would we feel  one company controlled 92 per cent of the global construction and engineering trade? Galloway asks. \u0026ldquoWould we worry that their power and influence had breached the reasonable threshold or would we just think they were awesome innovators as we do with Google?  YouTube, owned by Google, uploads 400 hours of video every minute, giving it more video content than any other company on Earth. \u0026ldquoIt also controls the operating system on two billion Android devices, says Galloway.  When the EU finally caught up with Google and fined it 2.7bn for anti-competitive practices, the penalty amounted to just \u0026ldquothree per cent of its cash on hand, says Galloway. Part of Google\u0026rsquos power lies in the fact that it is a \u0026ldquoBenjamin Button company \u0026ndash the more you drive your car, the less valuable it becomes, but with Google, the more people use it the more valuable it becomes, because the more data it has gathered to be sold.  That power breeds power. With Google and Facebook controlling 51 per cent of the global mobile ad spend, few can dare to not do business with them \u0026ndash even though trust in the companies has been shattered by tax avoidance and the spreading of fake news.  \u0026ldquoAdvertisers have just two platforms to market their products online, says Galloway. Advertisers need Google and Facebook more than the tech giants need them. Galloway says  Ford decided it was so concerned about fake news that it pulled advertising the company \u0026ldquowould be commended for their actions in the media, and the market would promptly cut 10 per cent off their share price.  Google versus you  BIG Tech is also ganging up on consumers. Galloway says we should think of Google as like the shop window of a huge department store on Christmas Eve \u0026ndash only it\u0026rsquos the size of Everest.  \u0026ldquoAnyone can purchase a place in that window and land at the top of Google search, he says. \u0026ldquoWhen someone types \u0026lsquoStar Wars action figures\u0026rsquo, the retailer that has bid the most is going to top the paid listings. Amazon regularly buys that number one spot, because it has the money to do so.  The game is being played \u0026ldquoby a dferent set of rules and with a dferent deck of cards. Not only does Google destroy jobs, crush culture, and avoid taxes \u0026ndash but they\u0026rsquove been weaponised by some of the most dangerous people on Earth. Russian military intelligence has used the big media platforms online to disrupt Western democracies.  Google\u0026rsquos AdSense system \u0026ndash which pays per click \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoprovided much of the revenue to Eastern European teams that were flooding the web with fake news, says Taplin. In November 2017, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr begged Google, Facebook and Twitter, saying: \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot let nation-states disrupt our future. You\u0026rsquore the frontline of defence for it.  Tech-watchers like Galloway have nothing but scorn for such special pleading. \u0026ldquoThey should be our frontline against our enemies? Yeah, f*** that.  Fightback  THERE is a bubbling current of anger now growing against Google. So is it time to do what has been done to monopolies in the past and break up Google?  \u0026ldquoThe last 10 years, says Taplin, \u0026ldquohave seen the wholesale destruction of the creative economy \u0026ndash journalists, musicians, authors and film-makers \u0026ndash wrought by three tech monopolies, Google, Facebook and Amazon. Their dominance in Articial Intelligence will extend this \u0026lsquocreative destruction\u0026rsquo to much of the service industry, including transportation, medicine and retail.  As a final warning, he adds: \u0026ldquoWhen the flood of unemployment brought about by the AI revolution is upon us, we will not be ready.

Mark Hogarth, 42, textile designer  Why? He is the Harris Tweed guru  When, earlier this year, Scotland was rebranded for the world, in the \u0026pound6 million Scotland Is Now campaign, it included a short film with Mark Hogarth, creative director of Harris Tweed Hebrides. There is good reason for this, for the former male model, who grew up on a dairy farm in Ardrossan, is widely credited with having made Harris Tweed cool again. Ten years ago, the company of which he is creative director took over a derelict mill at Shawbost, Harris. Now Harris Tweed Hebrides has an annual turnover of \u0026pound10million and employs 250 mill-workers and weavers. These days Harris Tweed has a host of celebrity fans, from Gwyneth Paltrow through to Madonna. Hogarth is at the heart of an incredible revival story. In his Scotland Is Now film, Hogarth observes, \u0026ldquoFor me the key word is pioneering \u0026ndash because the word fashion is almost synonymous with the word \u0026lsquonew\u0026rsquo. You\u0026rsquove got to captivate what is new, but not at the expense of your own tradition.  19. Mary Moriarty, 79, former pub landlady  Why? She\u0026rsquos a legend  At nearly 80 years old \u0026ndash her birthday, which she shares with her twin, is just around the corner \u0026ndash Mary Moriarty, former landlady of the Port O\u0026rsquo Leith, is still one of the coolest, most glamorous people you\u0026rsquore likely to come across in increasingly hipsterised Leith. She even has an entry on the Advanced Style website, a blog-appreciation of the fashion sense of older women by New Yorker Ari Seth Cohen. But, more crucially, she is also one of those local legends who is always out there doing her bit for the community, whether it\u0026rsquos putting her energies into the Leith Festival, or hands-on picking up litter in the park whenever there\u0026rsquos a big event. The Port O\u0026rsquo Leith, when she ran it, was one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most iconic boozers \u0026ndash a place where the clientele used to dance on the bar and it felt as  almost anything might happen. Formerly frequented by sailors, who gave it its nautical d\u0026eacutecor, it had working-class edginess. A year or so ago it refurbished and gone the way of most hipster pubs \u0026ndash but Moriarty still pops in very occasionally, for some of the old regulars are still there.  18. Mido Soliman, 42, drinks industry entrepreneur  Why? He\u0026rsquos bringing back the old-fashioned pub, with new-fangled drinks  Pubs can change an area. They can make a community. Mido Soliman had been living and working in Kinning Park for a while when he heard that the Old Toll bar was closing down. \u0026ldquoI went down to see it, he says, \u0026ldquoand it was like walking into a time machine. Beautul. It was an old pub that had just been misused. There were lots of screens and plasma screens. Soliman had long had a love of old pubs. He had grown up in West London, Ladbroke Grove, and as a child he\u0026rsquod always loved the magic of Victorian bars. \u0026ldquoIt always looked like there was a lot of fun and laughter and joyous times coming from inside. So that was what he tried to recreate. He stripped back the d\u0026eacutecor and turned it, as he puts it, into \u0026ldquoa pub that\u0026rsquos part of the community. No screens, no fruit machines, just craft beers, great drinks and knowledgeable bartenders. What brought him to Glasgow in the first place? \u0026ldquoA girl I was dating many years ago. She was from Scotland and moving back up. I thought it was a good opportunity. That relationship didn\u0026rsquot last too long but Glasgow was such a dynamic, cosmopolitan place I thought I\u0026rsquod stay. I love the city, I love the people. And now it\u0026rsquos home.  17. Karen Gillan, 30, Actor  Why? Because she\u0026rsquos putting the sass into superhero movies  You could argue that Gerard Butler is Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest Hollywood star these days. And I guess  you like meathead melodrama  that\u0026rsquos fine. But really, the clever money is on Karen Gillan these days.  She\u0026rsquos already got two  of the Galaxy movies and one Avengers movie on her Imdb listing  and she\u0026rsquos working on a sequel to Jumanji in which she will hopefully once again have the chance to show off her comic chops.  Fact is, ever since she turned up as Amy Pond in Doctor Who, dressed in a short skirt and a fancy dress version of a police unorm, Gillan has been a red-haired tonic smart, funny, ambitious and not embarrassed to be.  She\u0026rsquos conquered British TV, carved out a career for herself in the United States and even turned her hand to directing .  Now all she needs a modern-day Nora Ephron to realise that she is clearly a Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts in waiting.  16. Phil MacHugh, 31, PR guru  Why? If there\u0026rsquos a cool party he\u0026rsquos probably there \u0026ndash or running it.  MacHugh is the PR behind some of the most current brands, hotels and restaurants. If there\u0026rsquos a swanky party or opening event happening, he\u0026rsquoll probably be there, possibly dressed in a dapper pink suit and with a hairdo that looks as  it was created under zero gravity conditions. He\u0026rsquos there on the front row at many a Paris or London fashion week show. Among the many big bashes this \u0026ldquoMan about Town \u0026ndash as his column in The Scottish Sun is titled \u0026ndash has been to, was Pharrell Williams\u0026rsquo 40th birthday, where, MacHugh recalls, \u0026ldquoHe had Alicia Keys pop out a cake and sing him Happy Birthday.  But MacHugh isn\u0026rsquot just about the style and the partying \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos a television presenter and Gaelic speaker, who values his cultural heritage and believes that is cool. In the run up to the Independence referendum, he was a PR and events manager for the Yes campaign. Glasgow-raised and from a Barra family, he\u0026rsquos even a nty Highland dancer, and counts Simple Mind\u0026rsquos Mick MacNeil as a relative. What next for the PR? His agency, SKAPA, is, he says about to bring a new hotel brand to Scotland \u0026ndash Moxy hotels. Big parties are promised, naturally.  15. Kimberly Benson, 27, wrestler  Why? She rocks the wrestling ring.  You only have to watch footage of Kimberly Benson slamming an opponent to the floor to know she is on this cool list. Known by her stage name, Viper, \u0026ldquothe vixen of violence, she\u0026rsquos a star of World Of Sport wrestling and pioneer female in her sport. Benson is big in Japan, where she has a huge following, and was the first Scottish wrestler to main-event the famous Korakuen Hall. She has even been the subject of a BBC documentary, Fight Like A Girl, and is one of the key stars lined-up for World of Sport\u0026rsquos much-anticipated live tour of the UK starting in January next year.  She\u0026rsquos a charismatic, pantomime figure who swaggers across the ring in her trademark costume of leotard and fishnet tights. Part of the appeal of wrestling is, she says, \u0026ldquothe rebellion of it all. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been one of those punk-rock kids that just wanted to cheat the system in some ways. I love watching larger than le characters rebel against conformity. That\u0026rsquos why she chose the name Viper, in tribute to Stone Cold Steve Austin, the Texas Rattlesnake, one of the biggest wrestling rebels of them all.  Benson\u0026rsquos le mainly revolves around her sport, though she does still work in her father\u0026rsquos coach business in Ayrshire. As well as wrestling opponents, she has also fought off, and floored, stigma around her body shape. \u0026ldquoPeople, she has said, \u0026ldquowrote me off because of my size and what I look like and thought I was some stupid, blonde girl who was never going to amount to anything.  14. John Byrne, 78, artist and playwright  Why? You don\u0026rsquot get more dapper.  Earlier this year, when John Byrne, was named Scotland\u0026rsquos most stylish man, the artist and playwright\u0026rsquos response, it seems, was astonishment. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom surprised I\u0026rsquove lived to the age of 78, never mind being a trend-setter, he said. \u0026ldquo\u0026ldquoHalf the time I dress like a tramp. There\u0026rsquos a lot of days where I go out to the post office and I just throw anything on. I\u0026rsquom often a sight so folk steer clear of me, holding their nose.\u0026rsquo. Somehow this comment just made the artist seem even cooler. For, in his Tweed suits, cravats and brogues he has a dapper elegance. In fact, no matter what Byrne says or does, he\u0026rsquoll always be an icon of sorts. Part of it is his art, part of it his personal style, and some of it is the way he has lived his le. Byrne isn\u0026rsquot afraid to do or talk about things that are shocking to some. His marriage to Tilda Swinton, with whom he had two children, was unconventional. Recently, he revealed, he understood that he was the child of an incestuous relationship between his mother and his grandfather.  13. Hayley Scanlan, 35, fashion designer  If there\u0026rsquos one designer in Scotland who is really making a mark on pop music and popular culture it\u0026rsquos Dundee\u0026rsquos Hayley Scanlan. Her designs are so of-the-moment, that they are frequently copied by fast fashion stores \u0026ndash and what makes her all the more cool is that Scanlan is not having it. Frequently she calls them out. \u0026ldquoI just think they\u0026rsquore so brazen about it, she says. \u0026ldquoIt happens so much now and it\u0026rsquos like the norm. You\u0026rsquove got to accept it, which is not right. Why not call it out?  Twice-winner of Young Designer of the Year, Scanlan is the go-to vision for many a band \u0026ndash from Little Mix through to Jessie J. Her big influences also come from the music she grew up with: Debbie Harry, Madonna and Michael Jackson. \u0026ldquoMy aunties and my mum and dad all played the Thriller album, she recalls. \u0026ldquoI remember I used to have a Michael Jackson doll and I always used to point to the TV and say he\u0026rsquos my boyfriend.  Impressively, she managed to star up her own business round the time of the birth of her twin sons. \u0026ldquoThey were six months old and it was a bit wild and I don\u0026rsquot actually know how I\u0026rsquove managed to do it. I became a single mum, so I kind of had no choice but to work. Right now, she says, she\u0026rsquos working on a top-secret project, creating designs for a band whose name she will not ulge. She is also working on \u0026ldquoa project involving bagpipes. The coolest thing she\u0026rsquos ever done? \u0026ldquoMaking clothes for the Little Mix video last year. Even my sons think it\u0026rsquos cool because they\u0026rsquore at school and all the little girls are like Little Mix obsessed.  12. Andy Murray, 31, social media star  Why? He\u0026rsquos a master of the Instagram volley  Who cares  it\u0026rsquos not a big winning, or even playing, year for our Andy \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos done enough of that to give him cool points to last a letime. Right now what makes him cool is not the tennis, but the social media entertainment he\u0026rsquos bringing us. It\u0026rsquos tweets like the one he did last autumn, parodying Donald Trump\u0026rsquos tweet about Time Magazine person of the year. It\u0026rsquos his banter with rival Nick Kyrgios. It\u0026rsquos pictures like the one he posted of his nose bloodied by a run in with his daughter. It\u0026rsquos the surreal Instagram Q\u0026ampA he did earlier in the year. Game, set and Instagram match to Murray.  11. Nikita Scott, 31, surfer and environmentalist  Why? She\u0026rsquos an eco-warrior of the waves  The best campaigners for the ocean are those who know it well \u0026ndash surfers, yachters, ers. One of them is Nikita Scott, born and raised in Tillicoultry, now resident in New York, where she heads up the city\u0026rsquos chapter of the eco-warrior organisation, Surfrider. Not only she leading a fight against the Donald Trump administration\u0026rsquos plans to expand off-shore drilling, but she already has one campaign success under her belt. She and her chapter fought a successful two-year campaign to stop the building of a liquefied gas port off Long Island.  Scott has been surfing since she was in her third year at the University of Glasgow and she decided to try a new club, found herself on a trip to Tiree, and was hooked. For her, part of the attraction, was \u0026ldquobeing in touch with the ocean \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a connection to nature that I don\u0026rsquot really get in any other situation.  What really ignited her environmental conscience, though, was some of the things she saw when she spend a year, post-university, travelling the world, working and seeking out that perfect wave. One of those things was the destruction already well under way of the Great Barrier Reef, and the other was the waves of plastic she saw when she was in Bali. The best wave she\u0026rsquos ever ridden? \u0026ldquoOne in Portugal \u0026ndash it was incredible.  10. Connor Newall  Connor Newall, 19, model  The features of Govan model Connor Newall, angular, low-browed and chiselled, have graced many a high-profile fashion campaign and magazine cover. They were there on the big Tom Ford 2018 summer campaign, and there too in a Pharrell Williams\u0026rsquo Raw brand shoot. But Newall is more than just a striking face. He is a story too. Four years ago, he was spotted, while rushing to class in Trinity High school, by a casting director Renfrew, who invited him to an audition for a short awareness film about kne crime. Newall played the lead role, but the film also had a personal relevance. His own cousin had been victim of a fatal kne crime, and, when newspapers and magazines featured his tale and he became a figurehead for the awareness campaign.  Three years later and he is one of the world\u0026rsquos iconic male models. His fashion impact is global. When we talk he\u0026rsquos preparing to go to Barcelona and shoot for GQ China, weeks ago he had been in a Vogue Homme film. What he wants now is to go back to the medium in which he made his first break, and forge a career in acting. Earlier this year, he appeared in a short film, titled Bunny, which is he says about \u0026ldquomental health awareness. He hopes this will be the start of a new career. But, he points out, global success hasn\u0026rsquot changed him too much. When he\u0026rsquos home he likes to hang out with his mum and his girlfriend. And, he says, his personal look hasn\u0026rsquot changed. \u0026ldquoI still don\u0026rsquot see what people see in me, he says. \u0026ldquoI still dress a wee bit like a Ned. It\u0026rsquos all good.  9. Marie Macklin, entrepreneur  Why? She\u0026rsquos making the regeneration happen.  When, nine years ago, in Kilmarnock, 20,000 people marched to save the Johnnie Walker plant, Marie Macklin was at the head of that crowd. This was her community, where she had grown up and gone to school \u0026ndash where her father had run a construction business. It was also a place that even during her childhood, she had seen economically decline.  But Macklin didn\u0026rsquot just stop at marching. Her experience in the financial industry in London meant she had the knowledge to take that energy and make something of it, and she did. \u0026ldquoThat day, she recalls, \u0026ldquowas the catalyst for me to create the HALO brand which will provide young people and the local community with sustainable long-term economic and social benefits.  Macklin, whose coolness extends to the bling of her flamboyant personal style, has countless awards to her name, including Female Business Leader of the Year 2017. Her aim is to bring economic le back, not only to Kilmarnock, but to other sites across the UK. It begins at the site of the former Johnnie Walker bottling plant, where their first project will be an urban park. \u0026ldquoThe HALO, she says, \u0026ldquois about being disruptive and rocking the economy to create practical advantages for local communities. We like to think and act as pioneers. It also involves forging ties with partners like Scottish Power, which she says \u0026ldquois committed to playing a key role in creating the HALO\u0026rsquos cyber and digital training and learning facility which will be at the forefront of the \u0026lsquoFourth Industrial Revolution\u0026rsquo  8. Iain Stirling, 30, comedian  Why? He is the voice of the Love Island generation  When, this year, the whole of the UK, including George Osborne, seemed to drop everything to watch Love Island, one of the chief draws of it was the man who brought the pantomime wit, irony and geekish megalomania to its voiceover. That man was Scottish comedian Iain Stirling. Back in 2017, NME had declared him the \u0026ldquoreal champion of the show. This year, it seemed he was shaping up as a cultural figure in his own right \u0026ndash bringing a show to the Edinburgh fringe, publishing a book, Not Ready To Adult Yet, at, and getting spotted at Wimbledon cosying up to his girlfriend, fellow presenter, Laura Whitmore.  But Edinburgh-born and raised Stirling was initially sceptical about doing the show that has made his name. It as only after he was invited to do the very middle-class Latitude music festival because of his part in the show that he began to realise it might be a cult hit. His theories about its success? \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about relationships. We talk about relationships essentially throughout the entire programme and there\u0026rsquos very little deviation from that \u0026ndash and relationships are the one thing that everyone wants to gossip about most of the time. It\u0026rsquos like Love Island went, \u0026lsquoDo you want to know about that stuff? Well, here\u0026rsquos a show that\u0026rsquos an hour of it every day.\u0026rsquo  7. Jamie Genevieve, 25, make-up vlogger  Why? She\u0026rsquos Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest social media star \u0026ndash and she\u0026rsquos for real  When fans turned out to meet make-up vlogger Jamie Genevieve on her recent tour promoting her first lipstick, frequently they would weep. The social media star has over 700,000 YouTube followers, and many of them feel almost as  she were their friend or big sister. Her fans, particularly those in Scotland, feel they know her, and even are supported by her. What marks Genevieve out from other make-up tutorial influencers, is how real and relatable she seems. As she said to us herself, part of her appeal, is that she is \u0026ldquoquite daft. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot edit myself loads. If things go wrong I keep it in. If I look rubbish in one frame, I keep it in. It doesn\u0026rsquot bother me. I think everyone\u0026rsquos a bit weird and I\u0026rsquom not scared of being bit of a weirdo.  The Glasgow-based vlogger is also refreshingly honest about her looks. \u0026ldquoI think the most honest picture of me ever, she says, \u0026ldquois a picture of me jetlagged, on my couch, with a plate of dinner on my chest. Someone turned it into a meme and it went totally viral, and I was, like, \u0026lsquoBrilliant.\u0026rsquo  But Genevieve\u0026rsquos le, of course, is quite dferent from her fans. Through her weekly vlogs, they get to see her jetting across the world \u0026ndash on safari in Kenya, partying in Ibiza and staying at swanky hotels - as well as getting her lip fillers done in her local beauty clinic. She, her fiance, Jack McCann and their dog, Drogba, are probably the closest we, in Scotland, have to to our very own Kardashians.  6. Josh Littlejohn, 31, social entrepreneur  Why? He got thousands of us to sleep in the park  Josh Littlejohn has changed our perceptions of how to tackle homelessness. With his charity, Social Bite, he has gone from selling sandwiches to building a village for the homeless, and, this year, a huge project to get 800 rough sleepers off the streets of our cities.  He\u0026rsquos the man who somehow managed to lure George Clooney and Leonardo Dicaprio to his little sandwich shop on Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Rose Street, and who, last year, persuaded 8000 of us to sleep out in Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Princes Street Gardens to raise money for his Social Bite village of houses for the homeless. This year, 12,000 people will sleep out in parks in four dferent cities to fundraise for a project which he hopes will transform our approach to homelessness and get those 800 people off the streets.  Littlejohn is a trailblazer. He has a principle of not paying himself more than seven times the wage of his lowest paid member of staff. In the early days of Social Bite, he and his partner Alice Thompson, even had some of their homeless staff live in their one bedroom flat because they had nowhere else to stay.  What keeps him going? \u0026ldquoNot wanting to let down my teenage, idealistic self, he says Littlejohn\u0026rsquos own childhood in Blair Drummond was relatively affluent - his father was a successful restaurateur but he went to the local state school, marched for Make Poverty History, listened to Rage Against The Machine, and wanted to \u0026ldquochange the world.  5. Lauren Mayberry, 30, singer  Why? She\u0026rsquos our Joan of Arc  Fronting electro-pop maestros Chvrches, undeniably one of Scotland\u0026rsquos coolest bands, should be reason enough for the Stirlingshire-born singer\u0026rsquos place on The Cool List. But her contribution goes well beyond fashion and music: she has also shown herself to be an astute and unabashed contributor to discussions about sexual politics and gender issues.  Intelligent, witty and vocal, she has been trolled half to death over the years as a result, but as much as she\u0026rsquos a lightning rod for online haters so has she become a standard bearer of sorts for young feminists and gay rights activists. Earlier this year she talked about the rape threats she has had along the way, and observed that,  she had known this was what the career would be like, she might have, as a teenager thought, \u0026ldquoWhy the f--- would you want to do that?\u0026rsquo She has campaigned with Amy Poehler for girl\u0026rsquos empowerment. She wrote her master\u0026rsquos thesis on images of women in fashion magazines. Next year, she and Shirley Manson, will delver the keynote speech at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos sure to be punchy.  As she told the Sunday Herald earlier this year, she isn\u0026rsquot afraid to call out \u0026ldquobullshit when she sees, hears or reads it. Not for nothing did The Eurythmics\u0026rsquos Dave Stewart dub her a \u0026ldquopunk rock Joan of Arc.  4. Darren McGarvey, 34, rapper and author  Why? He wrote the book of the year  Even before Darren McGarvey won the Orwell Prize for political writing earlier this year, people were saying he was the stand-out, authentic voice of a generation. His memoir Poverty Safari, originally published by Luath press, for which he won the prize, had been much-anticipated \u0026ndash for McGarvey, a rapper, who performs under the stage-name Loki, had already gathered a social media following as a smart commentator who knew first-hand what deprivation was.  Poverty Safari, with its subtitle, \u0026ldquounderstanding the anger of Britain\u0026rsquos underclass, was a savage exploration of poverty. Partly it told the story of McGarvey\u0026rsquos own dficult childhood. At one point he even describes how his mother, an alcoholic and drug addict who died from cirrhosis at 36, chased after him, aged just five years old, with a serrated bread kne. But it was also a razor-sharp polemic \u0026ndash one that declared war on the conditions that allow the cycles of abuse and addiction to continue.  The world is looking for eloquent voices like McGarvey\u0026rsquos to explain things. That\u0026rsquos why he was invited on to Question Time, where he shone. It\u0026rsquos why his Poverty Safari Live, at the Edinburgh Fringe was a hit. It\u0026rsquos also why earlier this year he clinched a two-book deal with Ebury, the non-fiction wing of Penguin. It\u0026rsquos why he is the person invited to read the bedtime story at the Glasgow Sleep In The Park. He stands out in an angry world. For what marks McGarvey out is not just his own perspective, but that he is open to others. He is, as he has said, in an often all-too tribal world, trying \u0026ldquoto find out what\u0026rsquos true, even  I don\u0026rsquot like it.  3 Rachel Maclean, 31, artist  Why? She makes our social media hell into fabulous art  There\u0026rsquos no artist quite like Rachel Maclean. She has created a mad, filmic vision of her own, through a process all of her own.  Most of the strange and grotesque characters in her films are her, in disguise, transformed with thick layers of garish make-up and digital effects. She is the one lip-syncing to found audio-tracks.  She is the figure transported via green screen into a bizarre universe \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos all magnicently out there.  Maclean is as brilliantly surreal as Bjork, but she is also a reminder of what art can do, that journalism or a TV documentary can\u0026rsquot.  She nails the nightmare that is our social media and fake news age. Spite Your Face, the film she presented last year at the Venice Biennale, turned the Pinocchio tale into a satire on the Trump era, and, over a year on, seems more relevant than ever.  She demonstrates, too, the extremes an artist may go to for their art. Maclean spent a month eating and sleeping in Birmingham\u0026rsquos Bullring shopping centre, dressed as a giant, grotesque bunny.  For her films, she says, \u0026ldquoI live inside the world of the film quite extensively for the few years it takes to make it. The time you\u0026rsquore in costume is maybe a day, but then there\u0026rsquos just all the living and thinking about the characters.  But, with Maclean, what makes her all the more cool is that she is now taking her vision to a wider audience. This autumn will see her much-hyped first feature film broadcast on the BBC.  Filmed in the derelict spaces of St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary, it\u0026rsquos a feminist response to Kenneth Clark\u0026rsquos landmark cultural series Civilisation.  2 Gerry Cinnamon, 32, singer  Why? He\u0026rsquos a belter.  When, earlier this month, Gerry Cinnamon added a few extra dates to his tour, they sold out in three minutes. Last week footage of Irish dancers performing to his hit, She\u0026rsquos A Belter, went viral.  There are plenty of big names out there in Scottish music, but right now it\u0026rsquos Gerry Cinnamon\u0026rsquos moment.  Right now it\u0026rsquos his very Scottish version of cool \u0026ndash just a man on a stage with his guitar, singing out some great tunes, \u0026ndash that has got Scotland absolutely buzzing. What he did at TRNSMT earlier this year said everything about him.  Taking the mainstage after J Hus pulled out, he turned the audience into a great, huge belting choir, who even chanted out his name. \u0026ldquoSee when the crowd\u0026rsquos with you, he said, \u0026ldquosinging every word it\u0026rsquos a mad feeling. Beautul mayhem.  Geoff Ellis director of TRNSMT recognized how big he was. \u0026ldquoNot since Oasis have I seen someone go on such a rapid trajectory around here, he said.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos gone from playing to 50 people to a point where he could easily sell out the Hydro.  \u0026ldquoWe had to bring him back.  What makes him all the cooler, is that success didn\u0026rsquot come early. He was told along the way that he shouldn\u0026rsquot sing with a Scottish accent.  He had to crowd source the money for his first album which came out last year.  He remains an independent musician, unattached to any record company. He\u0026rsquos a belter, in other words, with attitude.  1 Aldo Kane, 40, adventurer  Why? He keeps his cool in extremes  Almost everything Aldo Kane does is so extreme or terrying it would make most of us melt into a puddle.  He is the kind of cool, in other words, that is good at keeping calm in a hairy situation \u0026ndash whether when working with gun-toting South American narcotics dealers for the documentary, The Real Narcos, or filming inside a volcano that unfortunately happens to start erupting.  He also has a beard that looks more cofed for climbing mountains than pulling pints in a trendy pub.  Anywhere you imagine you might be nervous of going, he\u0026rsquos been there: an Ebola treatment centre, water-flooded caves, rowing a boat across the Atlantic on a world-record breaking trip.  \u0026ldquoEverything, says Kane, \u0026ldquohas been in an extreme, or remote or hostile environment. It can be benign, in a cave or a bunker, or it can be full-on being chased by Mexican drug rings.  For years Kane was the safety and ropes guy behind many of TV\u0026rsquos extreme adventure or nature shows, taking presenters to breath-taking and risky locations, but not appearing much on screen. This year he has broken through as a star himself, with all of his work on screen, and a hectic schedule of trips for many of the major television channels.  He has been in Russia with speed-obsessed Guy Martin, done a survival race in Borneo with Ed Stafford, and been on countless trips with Steve Backshall with whom he is filming the ground-breaking BBC primetime Expedition series.  When we talked in July, he had just emerged, blinking, into the light after ten days\u0026rsquo solitary confinement in a nuclear bunker, and was about to fly to the 24 hour daylight of Greenland for an expedition with Backshall.  When, last week, we emailed him, he was in Suriname in South America, about to head down the river into unexplored jungle. Somehow, in the middle of this, he was also managing to hold down a relationship with a producer of nature documentaries.  The Kilwinning-raised son of two paramedics\u0026rsquo route to exploration came via the Scouts. From 12, he and twin Ross would camp on their own, in places like Glencoe. At 16, his eyes set on adventure, he joined the Royal Marines, where he became a sniper.  He says, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been spoiled by the attention and the slight risky lestyle and basically it\u0026rsquos very dficult and very addictive.  What, out of all his experiences, was his most petrying moment? \u0026ldquoThere are two in the last year. Being inside the volcano when it was erupting wasn\u0026rsquot cool. Then when I was working in south America with the cartel in The Real Narcos. All around the world I\u0026rsquove worked in hazardous environments, but the worst environment is people. It\u0026rsquos human beings.

But this could be consigned to history under radical plans to transform Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry network which are detailed in a blueprint which will go before MSP\u0026rsquos this week.  Under the proposals, the current model of serving island communities will be ripped up and instead will be based on the Norwegian system of smaller ferries covering shorter routes.  The move aims to increase capacity with more ferries and in some cases journeys being broken up using islands as \"land bridges\" to reduce journey times.  It would see islanders in the Outer Hebrides able to do business on the mainland in a day and  home without an overnight stay.  According to the expert behind it, it would also help repopulate islands as crew would live on the islands they serve rather than on board and staffing costs would be reduced.  Perhaps crucially, it would also dramatically reduce the annual subsidy paid to ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne to run the service.  The blueprint for the future of the network will go before Holyrood this week and comes as CalMac has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns of the ageing fleet.  Transport expert Roy Pedersen, who spent 30 years in Highlands and Islands development, has submitted evidence which he says would radically reform the network and save the taxpayer millions of pounds in subsidies paid to CalMac.  According to the proposal, the current level of investment is well in excess of other countries but productivity is \u0026ldquoextremely poor and deteriorating.  Under his plan, a new fleet of around 10 smaller, more efficient ferries would be built with the total bill of around \u0026pound280 million. Upgrades to the ports they would serve will cost another \u0026pound20m.  Pedersen points out that Andrew Banks, owner of Pentland Ferries, is awaiting delivery of a new 100-car capacity ferry at a cost of \u0026pound14m, compared with \u0026pound50m-plus for the new hybrid green ferry MV Glen Sannox currently being built at Ferguson\u0027s.  One of the main points in the paper is reducing the number of staff required for each journey and ending the practice of ferry staff staying on board which adds to the operating costs.  Ferries would be crewed by a staff of around 12 to 14 as opposed to the 30-plus currently used.  This would allow staff to work shts similar to other operators and in Norway, and enable more ferries to run during the day and extend the timetable with services starting earlier and finishing later.  Staff would also live in the communities they serve which, it is argued, would help boost the populations of remote island communities as the smaller ferries would be based in the island ports and not on the mainland.  Pedersen said: \u0026ldquoThe alternative of crew living ashore on island communities served would contribute to the government\u0026rsquos objective of boosting island economies and reduce ship capital and operating costs.  \u0026ldquoFor the larger CalMac vessels it takes nine personnel to berth and cast-off a ship, this is done in Norway with just one hand due to efficient \u0026ldquolock-on linkspan design.  \u0026ldquoThus,  more cost-effective policies and practices along Scandinavian lines were adopted, much improved and higher capacity services could be provided for less public money.  Lock-on linkspans are already used in Scotland at the ports served by Western Ferries at Hunter\u0026rsquos Quay, near Gourock and on Shetland\u0026rsquos inter-island ferries.  Western Ferries carry more passengers and vehicles than the CalMac competition on the routes but receives no public subsidy. Each lock-on linkspan would cost around \u0026pound1.5m to install at each of the 10 large ports that CalMac would serve with the new ferries.  But while the installation costs of around \u0026pound15m seems expensive, the cost of the vessels themselves add another \u0026pound280m.  However, two new hybrid ferries being built to ease pressure on the network, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, cost nearly \u0026pound100m. But the bill is set to be much higher as both are currently delayed until next summer at the earliest after hitting design problems at the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow which has heaped more pressure on the ageing fleet.  The delays come amid concerns that a recent signicant increase in traffic is causing severe problems for island communities. Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds this year.  Now CalMac\u0026rsquos own community board has condemned delays in new ferries and is demanding action. It was formed as part of CalMac\u0026rsquos successful franchise bid for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service in 2016.  At a recent meeting of the board in Mallaig, \u0026ldquodisappointment and frustration was reported from all parts of the network at the continuing delays in the delivery of the overdue vessels under construction, said chairman Angus Campbell.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt a meeting, also attended by CMAL and Transport Scotland, strong reservations were expressed at the apparent lack of a coherent long-term vessel replacement plan and the funding commitments necessary to provide both an improved fleet and the port improvements needed.  \u0026ldquoThe board feel they can work alongside the operator to help improve information quality and timing including maximising local knowledge.  \u0026ldquoThe communities board are keen to work positively with all parties to produce a more resilient and ambitious future for our ferry services resulting in better economic benefits for all that they serve but feel there is a real need for action now.  Critics say the current problems has been a generation in the making. Scotland\u0026rsquos islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old and are struggling to cope.  The average age of a ship is 22 and in the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building with 7,000 tonnes worth in 1994 alone, the average age was just 12.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because CalMac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  But when a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. CalMac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled ready to move in and act as relief.  Even  it did have a spare, CalMac could far from guarantee it could use it because every port is dferent, whether it be an ageing linkspan or unusual tide, making it dficult for ferries just to slot in.  However,  every port was fitted with the same locked-in linkspan and ferries were smaller and more versatile then they could be moved around the network more easily to cover any breakdowns, according to the blueprint.  The blueprint also outlines how routes could be shortened and slash journey times.  In Norway, ferries tend to travel between the shortest points across the water, with islands themselves being part of the journey.  Rather than go round the islands, ferries will dock at the nearest point, passengers will travel across the island by road, before picking up a ferry at the other side to continue the journey by sea.  Under the new proposal, Mull and Jura could play vital roles acting as these \u0026ldquoland bridges, slash journey times and increase service frequency to Islay and the Outer Hebrides.  Ferries would dock at Craignure on Mull as normal, but Barra passengers would travel on to Tobermory where they would pick up another ferry to continue the journey.  New terminals would also be built at Glendale on Skye to shorten the crossing to Lochmaddy on North Uist and another at Kilmoluaig to Tarbert on Harris.  Likewise, Islay passengers would get a ferry from Keills on the mainland and travel to Lagg on Jura, before crossing to Islay. One other advantage is that carbon emissions would be greatly reduced without the need for hybrid fuel ferries.  Pedersen added: \u0026ldquoBoth are much shorter than the current Kennacraig to Port Askaig/Port Ellen service on Islay and would allow up to ten daily crossings and the option of direct bus services between the islands and Glasgow.  Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: \u0026ldquoWe are continuing to invest in new vessels and ferry infrastructure to renew the fleet in accordance with the published Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan. Over \u0026pound1 billion has been invested in ferry services across the Clyde and Hebrides routes, since 2007.  \u0026ldquoWork is also already under way to appraise, and subsequently to deliver on, further improvements to the ferry services to the Western Isles.  The majority of all visitors to the Outer Hebrides travel through Stornoway harbour, emphasising the importance of the CalMac ferry service to both the town and the wider islands.  The M.V Loch Seaforth, the biggest vessel in the CalMac fleet, sails between Ullapool and Stornoway three times a day, bringing with it up to 700 passengers, 143 cars or 20 commercial vehicles each time it arrives in Lewis.  Some 280,000 ferry passengers, 95,000 cars and 13,000 commercial vehicles a year come to Stornoway via the ferry.  Weekend crossings operate at full capacity and strong growth in tourism means that there are severe capacity constraints during the summer months.  Stornoway Port Authority, which has ambitious plans to develop the harbour as part of a 20-year Master Plan, is developing proposals to ensure the Port is able to accommodate the freight ferry which will likely be deployed to the route over the next few years.  Alex Macleod, the authority\u0026rsquos chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoThe existing ferry provides a good service which is an absolute leline for the community. But the risks in being dependent on a single vessel underline the need for additional capacity to cope with existing requirements and future needs.  \u0026ldquoThe projects we are developing in the Master Plan will help stimulate further economic growth but capacity limitations on ferries could have an impact on that potential growth.  \u0026ldquoThere will always be dficulties with ferry traffic in such a weather-affected part of the world, and as we have done for over 140 years, we will continue to work very closely with Calmac ferries to assist with the delivery of a robust and flexible service. Liaising closely with Calmac Ferries we will work together to find solutions for the good of the islands and everyone who uses these essential ferry services.  HebCelt relies heavily on CalMac ferry services to bring thousands of music fans to Lewis each summer.  The event is a huge economic driver for the islands, generating more than \u0026pound2 million a year and filling hotels, guest houses and campsites. Half the festival audience comes from outside the islands and the ferry route from Ullapool to Stornoway is the main gateway to the Outer Hebrides for these visitors.  HebCelt is also a catalyst for many island-hopping holidays with festival-goers using it as the start of a tour of Lewis, Harris, the Uists and Barra which also depend on CalMac services.  Such is the demand during HebCelt that ferry services have been extended in recent years around festival time to ensure fans are able to get to and from the islands.  Festival director Caroline Maclennan said: \u0026ldquoWe have a really close relationship with CalMac and appreciate many of the dficulties and challenges it faces.  \u0026ldquoCalMac is doing its best with an ageing fleet. The real conversation taking place just now is the frustration over the lack of investment in our leline services by successive governments.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to criticise the service when things go wrong, but there are many sides to it.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very constructive dialogue with the company which helps us effectively address issues, not just those directly affecting ferry services, but also travel to ports and connecting services which can affect both regular travellers and visitors."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-looks-back-on-his-afghan-years","story":"  IT was one of those moments when all that matters is to go on despite one\u0026rsquos fear.  That\u0026rsquos how it was once upon a distant war many years ago, as I followed my guide along a dried-up river bed towards some foothills marking the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier.  Sidestepping a small cluster of butterfly landmines on the track ahead of us, I pointed to the ground and asked a simple one-word question:\u0026ldquoAfghanistan?  My guide\u0026rsquos grin was all the reply I needed. I was finally in.  This was a war long before the current one in Afghanistan. It was the 1980s, the height of the Afghan mujahideen guerrilla war against the Soviet Red Army who had invaded their land. It was a war that would come to be known as \"Russia\u0026rsquos Vietnam\".  It\u0026rsquos a sobering thought that Afghanistan has now been at war in some shape or form for going on 40 years. It\u0026rsquos now 17 years almost to the day that the United States launched it own invasion, much as the Soviets did all those decades before while the West was preoccupied with Christmas back in 1979.  Throughout all those intervening years as a correspondent I\u0026rsquove followed the fortunes of Afghanistan and never ceased to be amazed by the fortitude of its people.  The Soviet war was the one in which I earned my spurs as a war reporter, doing so in a country that I grew to love and in which I experienced the best and worst of times. Over decades I would witness the Russians leave, watch the rise of the Taliban and see the British and Americans come and go again. But it\u0026rsquos those early years of the Soviet war that I will remember most.  Time and again I would go back and forward illegally across the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan in exotic disguises. Western reporters, after all, were not meant to be inside Afghanistan with the guerrillas and the penalties  caught by the Russians could be severe indeed. At best, imprisonment as a spy in Afghanistan\u0026rsquos most notorious prison Pul-Charkhi, east of Kabul, lay in store.  Pulling out all the stops to avoid such a fate, on one occasion I made the crossing dressed as a woman, wearing a burka complete with painted toenails and sandals.  On another I was swathed in bandages soaked in sheep blood and laid in a makesht coffin pretending to be a wounded guerrilla fighter to escape detection by the Pakistani border authorities.  Always though, once inside Afghanistan, the subsequent long march in-country with the guerrillas would follow a familiar pattern.  Each night our heavily-armed band of mujahideen would set off by starlight to avoid the Soviet helicopter gunships. Looking back now I can scarcely believe how gruelling those marches were, some often anything up to 20 hours or more.  As we marched through the mountains, explosions often growled and rumbled and the horizon flickered like a candlelit room from some far-off battle or bombardment.  At night, as fatigue set in, events would assume an almost surreal quality, as  a line from the Arabian Nights had come to le. But instead of the 40 thieves, other groups of footsore, hollow-eyed mujahideen would pass by, murmuring \u0026ldquoManda nabashi\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoMay you not be tired \u0026ndash to which the reply was \u0026ldquoZenda bashi \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoMay you live.  Fear was a constant companion, its reminders never far away. The threatening look of some rival mujahideen on a lonely mountain track, the silhouette of a distant helicopter gunship like some bloated dragonfly, or the bright magnesium flare spiralling above a Russian outpost as we slipped quietly by in the dark.  Documenting Afghan guerrilla operations was not for the faint-hearted or unfit.  Sometimes the long weeks in the mountains, forced marches and hiding in caves from Russian patrols would eventually take their toll.  I remember once, wracked with dysentery, finding myself talking to the two dead men that lay either side of me for three days on the floor of a battered bus crammed with casualties, as it crawled towards the Pakistan frontier.  While I was clearly delirious somehow it seemed natural, reassuring even. Death has two faces.  One is non-being the other is the material being that is the corpse. Sometimes though it was better not to think too much about the lives of the dead. Like the afternoon we overran a Russian hilltop post near the Afghan village of Sanglakh.  Days of heavy fighting had left only a batch of pulverised emplacements, the charred bodies of its young Russian defenders sticking out from the rubble surrounded by spent shell cases and empty ration tins of Bulgarian meat.  One of them lay face up, twisted under some wooden beams. I stood there staring at him, feeling a strange affinity.  Both of us were so far away from home. Like me, this young man had come to this unforgiving place: eating, sleeping, marching, feeding fleas and falling ill with dysentery and hepatitis.  Like me, he\u0026rsquod become tanned, thin, made friends and lost friends. Unlike me though, he had no choice. Now he wasn\u0026rsquot even a conscript, just a \u0026ldquozinky boy\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo, as the Russians called those lucky enough to have their remains sent home in zinc-lined coffins.  Perhaps it was the stench, or the creeping sense of loneliness, but I started to turn away until a sudden shout stopped me in my tracks. At my feet a young Afghan guerrilla carefully traced a wire revealing a booby-trap grenade pegged into the ground at either end. I looked back at the young Russian. Only by chance had our common lot been deprived of its finale.  Years later, after the Russians had withdrawn from Afghanistan as Mikhail Gorbachev\u0026rsquos policies of \u0026ldquoglasnost and \u0026ldquoperestroika prevailed, the daily ritual of slaughter and survival was no longer against the Communists. Having routed the \"Reds\", Afghanistan\u0026rsquos holy warriors\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo, now they turned on each other in a bitter factional struggle for control of the country\u0026rsquos capital Kabul.  Once, during the battle for a gutted bus station in the city, the group of fighters I was with was caught in the open by a mortar barrage. It was like some nightmarish Sam Peckinpah movie being rerun. All around in a maelstrom of noise and confusion, men were being hurled into the air and coming down in pieces.  I found myself cowering alongside a low wall in a puddle of blood and muck, next to a man trailing his left leg from a string of tendon, his eyes bulging like those of a dying hen, as he reached out his hand to me.  Before I could grasp it, another shell had me automatically on my feet, running, my chest heaving like a spent swimmer\u0026rsquos.  To stay there was to end up like him. War has its emptiness, its zero points during which men are simply glad about not being dead.  Some days later, while looking for a safe place to shit without being shot, I came across a severed human hand lying in the mud.  Something convinced me it was his, haunting me as revenge for my fear and indference that day.  During those dark days in the mid 1990s as warlords and factions struggled for control of Kabul, the city\u0026rsquos civilians diced daily with death.  Just taking to the streets then was to run the gauntlet of bullets, rockets and shells that were fired indiscriminately into neighbourhoods, schools and hospitals.  One day, because of the fighting, I was told that Kabul\u0026rsquos Marastoon mental asylum had been abandoned by its staff, and patients had been left to fend for themselves.  Expecting the worst, I arrived at the open gates and cautiously ventured inside to find myself confronted by an unexpected scene.  Inside, the blind, crippled and mentally ill patients had taken to running their own lives cooking, baking bread, helping each other to the filthy toilets and washrooms, or playing soothing and reassuring music on flutes and the traditional stringed tambur as the war around them raged. It was the sanest place in the city.  Ever resourceful, most Afghans got on with le the best they could. There might have been a little respite from the fighting but already yet more barbarians were massing at the gates of Kabul. Enter next the zealots of the Taliban and their overseas guests Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.  Afghanistan\u0026rsquos wars up until then had always played out within its own land, but al-Qaeda had other ideas. With the September 11 attacks on the US it was only a matter of time before American military might and that of its allies was brought to bear.  As both the Americans and later the British bunkered in for the long war, I found myself on occasions embedded with their forces.  It was an odd feeling, totally the opposite of all those years before when I accompanied the guerrillas as they fought outside invaders.  Where once I had hidden in the mountains of the Hindu Kush, I now found myself sometimes flying across those same valleys and ridges in helicopters, much like the Russians I used to fear did in the past.  I recall once, while aboard a US Blackhawk Medevac helicopter, landing in a godforsaken seemingly forgotten outpost to pick up the wounded.  Clinging to a steep, craggy mountainside this American base had been attacked by the Taliban on numerous occasions.  Seconds later our patient\u0026rsquos stretcher was slid on board. He had been shot in the neck and stomach. Still conscious, his face was contorted with pain and his hair matted with blood. Over the clatter of the rotors I could hear nothing of his cries.  Only when we landed did the American crew chief tell me the wounded man was a suspected \u0026ldquobad guy, or Taliban. The US crew had risked their le to save him, not something I would have expected from my first Medevac mission.  Sometimes it was as  the war I was witnessing again now was just a continuation of those I had covered in Afghanistan in the past.  \u0026ldquoThis wound I got from the shuravi , a man called Haji Mohammed told me one morning, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a long scar below the elbow of his left arm.  His village was in Helmand\u0026rsquos upper Sangin Valley, a notorious Taliban stronghold.  As we talked, British Royal Marines from 45 Commando, who I was accompanying on a mission to destroy Taliban arms dumps, searched the man\u0026rsquos home and compound for the weapons intelligence had indicted in the vicinity.  Alongside Haji Mohammed stood some of his children, one of them a little girl who was barefoot and shivering in the bitter winter cold.  Poverty here is endemic and most people in rural Afghanistan, like Haji Mohammed\u0026rsquos family, have known nothing but war throughout most of their lives.  I asked him whether,  he were a young man today, he would fight the British and Americans the same way he had fought the Russians. \u0026ldquoMaybe yes, he replied with a mischievous grin.  It struck me that this was as close to an honest answer about what he thought of the Taliban as I was likely to get.  Forty years on from those days when Russian troops went to war in Afghanistan, the country still searches for an elusive peace.  Right now the Taliban are active in 70 per cent of the country and more civilians have been killed during the first half of this year than any other year since the UN started counting bodies in 2009.  Proud, tough as nails yet hospitable to the point of embarrassment, Afghans are overdue some respite. It hurts me to see them still suffering after all this time."},{"url":null,"title":"communist-sutherland-flag-could-be-scrapped","story":"  Critics of the standard \u0026ndash which was chosen by a selection panel following a competition run by the Lord Lieutenancy \u0026ndash have branded it \u0026ldquougly, \u0026ldquohideous, \u0026ldquocommunist and \u0026ldquoa budgie with a smirk.  The design features a swooping eagle with three stars \u0026ndash known as mullets \u0026ndash on a bright yellow and orange background. The colours have been associated with the Earls of Sutherland since the 12th Century.  The process to formally recognise the flag began in February and was put on hold in March after an online petition calling for a review of the design attracted more than 900 signatures.  Leslie Sharp, who is behind the petition, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a hard thing to swallow that an unelected office has the authority to dictate the terms of selection let alone authorise the final selection. That type of dictatorial authority should be redundant in a democracy.  \u0026ldquoA county community should have the final say on what flag represents us, especially since it will be our first flag and it conceivably will be there for a long time.  \u0026ldquoI feel the people of Sutherland are being pushed around like a serf by an old and out of date authority. The people of the county Caithness got to vote on their flag so it\u0026rsquos a bit of a slap in the face that the people of Sutherland have as yet not had that same respect.  The Lord Lieutenant for Sutherland Dr Monica Main initially defended the process, insisting it was open, transparent and democratic.  And supporters of the design, which had been approved by the Lord Lyon, say that the petition signatories represented fewer than five per cent of Sutherland\u0027s population.  However, petitioners against the flag won the backing of Conservative MSP Edward Mountain. He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not a great fan of the design. I\u0026rsquom not sure it sends the vibrant image that I think that Sutherland should be sending.

However, Mr Ashley has been unable to save outlets in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon after landlords refused to agree to new terms that would have allowed them to remain open.  Staff at these locations, which number in the hundreds, are now going through redundancy consultation.  A fourth House of Fraser in Bath is also at risk of closure as the businessman tussles with Bath City Council, the store\u0026rsquos landlord, over new rental terms.  The billionaire, who also owns Newcastle United, described landlords who have refused new terms as \u0026ldquogreedy.  \u0026ldquoI am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable, he said.  \u0026ldquoThose landlords whom we have been unable to agree terms with include, but are not limited to, the following: Parabola Hope Street LLP, Redefine Paragon Square Hull Limited, and FI Real Estate Management Ltd.  It is understood that landlords are reluctant to agree to the low, or in some cases zero, rents Mr Ashley is demanding.  Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, has pledged to save around 47 of House of Fraser\u0026rsquos 59 outlets since buying the chain.  He recently struck a deal to save House of Fraser\u0026rsquos flagship store in Oxford Street.

Among the latest stores to be rescued is in Birkenhead, the constituency belonging to the veteran MP Frank Field.  He described the news as \u0026ldquotremendous.  \u0026ldquoSix weeks ago, I wrote to Mike Ashley with an urgent plea to safeguard the future of our House of Fraser and the jobs of the store\u0026rsquos staff.  \u0026ldquoThanks to the positive discussions that have taken place since then with the store\u0026rsquos landlord, this cornerstone of our town centre is being given a chance to flourish once again, Mr Field said.

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 10:53 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 10:53 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 10:54 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That made me think it was worth trying to get something moving. Around 30 groups gave presentations.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The Scotsman was number one in the UK, ahead of The Times, ,  and Herald, with a net approval of 84 per cent – a massive 9 per cent ahead of its nearest rival.I believe this is because The Scotsman is Scottish from front to back, reporting on Scottish business, arts, culture, news, sport, obituaries, features and lestyle.

Scotland’s North Sea sector can take advantage of the “vast opportunities” offered by oil and gas exploration in Africa, one of Theresa May’s trade commissioners has said.            Emma Wade-Smith , newly appointed HM Trade Commissioner for Africa, says exporting Scottish energy expertise will be key trade strategy in the post-Brexit era.            On a visit to Scotland to promote trade links, Wade-Smith said the industry developed in Aberdeen should capitalise on the burgeoning oil and gas development in Africa which is creating a market worth billions of pounds.Wade-Smith’s trip to Scotland follows May’s recent trade mission to South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria to promote global trade after Brexit. Speaking to Scotland on Sunday, Wade-Smith said Africa was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, creating opportunities for Scottish business. She said Scottish expertise should be harnessed to help countries like Senegal and Mauritania, who are starting out on oil and gas oil production.It could also be used in countries like Angola and Nigeria where oil exploration is well-established.              “There is a huge amount of expertise and experience clearly in the oil and gas industry in Aberdeen,” she said. “So it is how do we take that to support countries across Africa in their own efforts to build an oil and gas capability? Also how do we use that experience and technological innovation to help African countries avoid some of the potential pitfalls of creating that domestic capability?”She added: “There are vast opportunities for Scottish companies across the entire industry and supply chain to grow their businesses.”Scottish expertise includes drillers, fitters and those involved with training. It also includes a host of supply chain enterprises which provide items such as equipment and clothing for an industry that has been hit by the falling oil price in recent years.” Oil \u0026amp Gas UK upstream policy director Mike Tholen said: “Embracing the opportunities available in the international export market could unlock an additional £150 million in the revenue of supply chain companies.

Writing in Scotland on Sunday, former shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray condemns the “shocking” anti-Semitism in Labour and attempts by the hard left to deselect MPs.            His article, published as Labour activists arrive in Liverpool for their UK conference, questions why Labour is not performing better in the polls and says more work needs to be done to make the party electable.            : Ian Murray: ‘No deal’ is biggest issue Britain facesMurray argues that Corbyn must look beyond the hard left and make Labour more appealing to mainstream voters. Otherwise, he says, the party will remain in opposition. His views will chime with moderate and Remain-supporting members of the Labour Party who are growing frustrated with Corbyn’s failure to make an impression in the polls despite the Conservatives being in chaos over Brexit.: Call second independence referendum by March, SNP MP saysMurray warns there is “upset, anger and consternation” among members over anti-Semitism, deselection threats and the party’s reluctance to tackle a hard Brexit.            Over the summer, Corbyn faced furious criticism for failing to tackle anti-Semitism engaged in by his supporters. His own views were also attacked by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who called him an “anti-Semite” – an accusation rejected by the party leader.Meanwhile, moderate Labour politicians have been  alarmed by a bid to change the rules to make it easier to remove sitting Labour MPs and accept members of hard-left groups. The proposals suggested by the left-wing Momentum group have been backed by Corbyn.“If we fail to reach out to a wider coalition of voters, we risk remaining in opposition,” writes Murray.“Jeremy Corbyn has attracted thousands of new members to our party. However, the polls – and last year’s election result – show that we all still have work to do to persuade voters that Labour can lead the country… I sincerely hope the conference is not dominated by internal talk about deselections, rather than what Labour can offer the country and how we can prevent a hard Brexit.”            The Edinburgh South MP, who resigned from the Shadow Cabinet over Corbyn’s leadership two years ago and is Scotland’s longest-serving MP, describes the Liverpool conference as the most important in decades. Murray is a supporter of a People’s Vote on the EU withdrawal deal, which will be one of the key subjects debated at the gathering. He argues that after the “debacle” of the rejection of Theresa May’s Chequers plan in Salzburg last week, the need for a stronger response to a hard Brexit is essential.In his article he writes that he’s encouraged that shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer are keeping the second vote option on the table. “I know Jeremy is reluctant,” Murray writes. “But I hope he listens to party members. There is an opportunity for Labour to do the right thing and demonstrate that we will put the country before party and the future before ideological dogma.”            Although Corbyn says he voted to stay in the EU in the Brexit referendum, Remainers have accused him of Euroscepticism. Like many on the left, Corbyn has reservations about being part of a political bloc based on the free market. Murray argues that the Prime Minister’s “dreadful response” to the rejection of her plans means the UK is heading for a “no-deal” Brexit – which makes a strong response from Labour vital.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday urged EU leaders to “step back from the abyss” and engage with the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan. Following the angry clashes at the Salzburg summit, Hunt said it was “counterproductive” to “insult” Britain’s referendum vote and to say the only way the UK could legally leave was by “breaking up your country”.“What we need to be doing in a situation like this is bringing people together,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.“This is a time for people in the EU to step back from the abyss, to sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work.”After EU leaders meeting in Austria on Thursday warned that a key element of the Chequers plan would not work, Hunt called them to engage with Britain in a “spirit of politeness and decency” to find an agreed solution.However, he did not rule out the prospect that the government could now seek a simple, Canada-style free trade agreement – favoured by many Tory MPs – rather than continuing with the more ambitious Chequers proposals.He underlined the Prime Minister’s warning that she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a “bad deal”.“What she is saying is, ‘Don’t mistake British politeness for weakness. If you put us in a dficult corner we will stand our ground’.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804198.1537733664!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour braced for showdown over corbyn s brexit position","story":"        Jeremy Corbyn has opened the door to a possible second referendum on EU membership by saying he will be \u0026#8220bound\u0026#8221 by a vote at the Labour conference in Liverpool on party\u0026#8217s Brexit policy.                Jeremy Corbyn has opened the door to a possible second referendum on EU membership by saying he will be “bound” by a vote at the Labour conference in Liverpool on party’s Brexit policy.            Labour members and unions have pushed for the party to support a so-called ‘People’s Vote’ on the terms of the UK’s Brexit deal and will debate the issue on Tuesday.            However, the exact wording of the motion to be voted on by party members will only be confirmed tomorrow, \u2028with more than 100 constituency submissions being compiled into a text for debate last night.An early draft was understood to be six pages long and contained a single reference to a new referendum as just one option that Labour could pursue. Many expect the final motion that emerges from the ‘compositing’ process to allow Mr Corbyn to retain broad room to manoeuvre.In interviews yesterday, the Labour leader made clear he still believed that an early general election was the best way to resolve the political crisis over Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.He said his party was ready to “put our case to Parliament” for an early poll in comments likely to fuel speculation that Labour will table a vote of no confidence in Theresa May  talks with Brussels fail.However, he pledged to respect the outcome of tomorrow’s debate despite saying last week Labour wouldn’t hold a second EU referendum under a Corbyn premiership.            Mr Corbyn told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Let’s see what comes out of conference. Obviously I’m bound by the democracy of our party.“There will be a clear vote in the conference. I don’t know what’s going to come out of all the compositing meetings that are going on.” A YouGov poll at the weekend found 86 per cent of Labour members think voters should have the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations and 90 per cent would now vote to remain in the EU.Even in the North and Midlands, where many Labour constituencies voted Leave in 2016, there was overwhelming support – 86 per cent and 88 per cent respectively – for a second vote. Some 81 per cent believe their standard of living would get worse after Brexit and 89 per cent said it would be bad for jobs.            Deputy leader Tom Watson said the party leadership must “respect” the views of members  conference opts to give voters a “final say” on Brexit.Conservatives seized on their comments as a sign Labour was ready to seek to overturn the Leave vote in the 2016 referendum.However, the influential union leader Len McCluskey said it would be wrong for Labour to start campaigning for a second referendum.He told BBC radio any second vote should not include an option to stay in the EU.“We have already had a people’s vote – they voted to come out of the EU,” the Unite leader said.            Pro-EU activists staged a rally and march in Liverpool as the annual Labour conference got underway yesterday in a bid to pile pressure on the leadership. A crowd waving EU and other flags chanted “bollocks to Brexit” and “it’s not a done deal” as they walked from St George’s Hall to a rally at Pier Head, close to where the conference is taking place.Some sections of the crowd also chanted directly at Mr Corbyn, saying: “Hey Jeremy, take a note, for the many, People’s Vote.”Tottenham MP David Lammy and peer Lord Adonis were among the speakers while MP Luciana Berger led the march.Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union, told the crowd he supported Mr Corbyn and said: “If there is one thing I know about Jeremy Corbyn, it’s that he respects democracy. When conference votes to say Labour should campaign for a People’s Vote on the terms of Brexit, he will go along with it.”Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis MP said: “The last pretence that Labour ever respected the democratic decision of the British people is rapidly disappearing.“If Labour back a second referendum, they will have broken their manesto pledge and betrayed millions of people who voted in good faith.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nSunday 23 Sep 2018 10:54 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbsp\n\nFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.\nIt is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.\nLaunched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.\nThe service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.\nFair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.\nThis means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.\nThe service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.\nDelivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.\nJamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\n\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\n\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"\nOne of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .\nHe has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.\nAlan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

ni leisure show springs into action with fun fuelled launch","story":"\nLocal man Billy Nutt welcomed traders and exhibitors alike to the adrenaline-packed launch, which featured a spectacular parkour demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

We would urge all motorists to take these seriously – doing so could save a child’s le.”\n\nMrs Rollston added that the UFU would like to see this extended to all rural primary schools as quickly as possible. New signage and lighting will be erected in the vicinity of the seven schools to warn motorists when the 20mph speed limit is operational.

The company has asked Belfast City Council to distribute this funding on its behalf.\n\n“Belfast City Council is developing a City Recovery Investment Programme which includes immediate, medium and longer term proposals to support businesses, re-establish and sustain high levels of trading the city centre in the lead up to Christmas and beyond, increase connectivity across the city centre, ultimately ensuring the city’s economic resilience. \n\n\u0026#8220The contribution made by Primark will be an important part of that overall programme delivery.\n\n“Council and its city partners will continue their engagement with traders and landlords.

They bury theirs and we bury ours.\n“Gray decides he wants a bit more of the business and advertises to bury Catholics as well. Into the mix comes Irena Bukowski, a young Polish woman who undercuts the both of them for half the price.\n“My role as Gerry McSorley is similar to me in many ways –  a grumpy old man. He hates the internet and is in the last century and likes it that way.”\nShaun, who plays Basil Gray is looking forward to getting into his role once again.\n“The truth is Basil doesn’t want to be an undertaker, but his father has passed away so he takes over the family business for financial gain and to get with the widows.\n“Basil is a gangster movie fan and there is some fairly crazy scenes with dead bodies.\n“We knew the play worked and it was just a matter of adding a few bits and pieces here and there.\n“The audience was fantastic last year. They just get all the themes so well.\n“As well as creating a funny and entertaining night out, Stephen wanted to stick two fingers up towards death and celebrate le.\n“The show is based on the morbid theme of death but ironically it becomes about all the dferent undertakers trying to stay alive.”\n\nThree’s A Shroud s to the Waterfront Hall from September 20-October 6.

He has two other units - one in Ballymena and another in Randalstown. \n\nThe singer and former Celebrity Masterchef contestant attended an event to celebrate his new venture at The Chelsea on the Lisburn Road.\n\nTalking to the Belfast , Shane, who opened his first Amen store last autumn, said: \"I didn\u0027t think the business would grow so fast but over the past 12 months but it has just taken off. I have good business partners from here so that\u0027s why I chose Northern Ireland as a location.\"\n\nSpeaking about his choice of sites, he added: \"I could\u0027ve opened in Belfast because it\u0027s the Mecca but I like to invest in smaller locations, and give back.\n\n\"I like Northern Ireland. I always find myself attracted to here and it\u0027s a great place to do business.\"\n\nShane, who is preparing for a final tour with Boyzone and will release, as part of the band, his last ever album, said his new store was ruffling the feathers of other footwear brands. \n\n\"I\u0027m already receiving phone calls about the cost of our products. Our shoes retail for around £39.99 and the industry standard for similar shoes also made of Italian leather would be £150. I\u0027m not going to sell them for that price when I know how much it costs to make them. \n\n\"For me it\u0027s about offering bargains. I never fell into that trap of buying designer clothing and I\u0027m not high fashion. Anything I create, I always try to be the best at it for the least.\"\n\nBoyzone\u0027s 25th Anniversary and Farewell Arena Tour commences in Belfast on January 23.\n\nAnd in November the band will release their last album, Thank You \u0026 Goodnight.\n\nShane, a father of two, said he \"felt good\" about the final tour with his pals but said he may feel dferently after the final performance.\n\n\"Ending it defines things for all of us.

PA\n\n\n\n\nThere are currently no ministers running government departments in Northern Ireland following the suspension of the powersharing government in January 2017.\n\nIn the absence of ministers, senior civil servants have had to step in to run departments.\n\nMr Nesbitt said he is “very concerned” that six months from when the UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, there appears to be a “signicant gap between where we are and where the department clearly wanted to be”.\n\n“While the Executive Office may be the engine room for ideas in our devolved arrangements, the Department of Finance is the beating heart of money management,” he said.\n\n“It has to be assumed therefore that  they bid for £1.65 million to deal with exiting the EU, they need £1.65 million.\n\n“This additional staffing resource was obviously identied because it is required to best understand and manage our needs as we prepare for the greatest shock to our political system since the Second World War, so it is very concerning that six months out from our exit from the European Union there is a signicant gap between where we are and where the department clearly wanted to be.”\n\nMr Nesbitt also queried the delays in filling vacancies against the backdrop of the recent civil service Voluntary Exit Scheme , which was brought in before the collapse of Stormont in January 2017.\n\n“The other key question relates to the fact that the underspend is explained, but not excused, by delays in filling vacancies, thus raising the question of whether the Voluntary Exit Scheme introduced by the last DUP/Sinn Fein coalition created those vacancies in the first place,” he said.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Finance said: “The Voluntary Exit Scheme concluded in May 2016 before the European Union Membership Referendum on June 23 2016.\n\n“The preparations for EU Exit emerged after the Voluntary Exit Scheme it is not possible to determine  the VES has had any impact on the number of vacancies.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"artist goes viral for creating amazing etch a sketch drawings","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

From the city of Porto onwards, you will see considerably more people but you\u0026rsquore walking along the coast which makes it really attractive.\n\nThe French Way, or Camino Franc\u0026eacutes, is the most popular route but the Camino del Norte along the north coast of Spain is a somewhat rougher trail of around 710kms. Edmund has done the French Way three time as well as the English Way.\n\nAs a social worker who manages hostels for homeless people in Belfast and beyond, Edmund sees his Camino walks as a way of taking time of his demanding work le.\n\n\u0026ldquoI get a chance to step out of the whole maelstrom of le and the pressure of work and everything else, said Edmund.\n\n\u0026ldquoEssentially it\u0026rsquos a pilgrimage but it\u0026rsquos also whatever you want to make of it.

There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees.

The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday.

They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running.

The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage.

Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C. Doyle, W.Y. Crichton, who was editor of the Down Recorder for 64 years, Brian Faulkner, the last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and mountaineer Dawson Stelfox, who climbed Mount Everest.\n\nOther speakers have included Senator David Norris with his one-man show on James Joyce, broadcaster Brian Black on his travels to Arctic regions and the late Arthur Pollock, verger of Down Cathedral, on his discovery of the Downpatrick Gold Find while digging a grave in 1954 and again in 1956.\n\nAnnual outing venues have included many interesting places such as the Armagh Planetarium, the Cathedrals of Armagh, Bishop Robinson\u0026rsquos library and stables, historic sites around Carlingford, walking tours of local towns and villages, The Somme Centre, The Boyne Valley Centre, boat trips and visits to private homes and castles. This year, the Society visited Collon House in County Louth.\n\nIn October 1960, a memorial to Sir Hans Sloane was unveiled in his Killyleagh birthplace.

The new body was named the Lecale \u0026amp Downe Historical Society, due to their shared aims, objectives and membership.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 2002, the Lecale Historical Society launched its website with the help of Mr Pat Devlin and encouragement from the late Dr James Hawthorne CBE, the society\u0026rsquos then president.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis provided an outlet for the Society to give details on the work that it does with the website containing a full index of articles and authors for the annual journal, copies of reports, annual programme and newsletters.\n\nThe website also includes some historical resources for the Lecale area, which include the 1901 census, Lewis\u0026rsquo Topographical Dictionary, Grfith\u0026rsquos Valuations of 1863, ships and shipwrecks associated with Lecale, the Nannie Cinnamon letters and ious others. The Society launched its own dedicated Facebook page at its annual meeting five years ago.\n\nThe society, which is one of the largest of its kind in Ulster with a membership of over 250, wishes to thank its many members and friends who have supported its work and volunteered over the past seven decades to ensure that the history and heritage of Lecale and surrounding parts of County Down are recorded for future generations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nAnyone who would like to join the society for just \u0026pound10 and prevail of free entry to all society lectures and a complimentary copy of Lecale Review each year, should visit www.lecalehistory or email info@lecalehistory.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland.

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

\u0026#8220under-prepared\u0026#8221 for Brexit due to delays in recruitment, an Ulster Unionist MLA has claimed.\n\n                \nMike Nesbitt revealed that the Department of Finance has handed back additional money it asked for to prepare for the UK’s departure from the European Union due to delays in filling jobs.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn correspondence with Mr Nesbitt, Sue Gray, permanent secretary at the department, said it had applied for £1.65 million to help prepare for Brexit.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe requested money was to help cover additional staffing resources identied to carry out EU exit preparation work in 2018/19.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe department received £1.34 million, but now expects to spend £1 million.\n\nIn the correspondence, Ms Gray attributed the underspend to “delays in filling vacancies”. The unspent money will be surrendered for reallocation.\n\nIn the absence of ministerial direction for Stormont, Mr Nesbitt said he is “very concerned” that six months from when the UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, there appears to be a “signicant gap between where we are and where the department clearly wanted to be”.\n\n“While the Executive Office may be the engine room for ideas in our devolved arrangements, the Department of Finance is the beating heart of money management,” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It has to be assumed therefore that  they bid for £1.65 million to deal with exiting the EU, they need £1.65 million.\n\n“This additional staffing resource was obviously identied because it is required to best understand and manage our needs as we prepare for the greatest shock to our political system since the Second World War, so it is very concerning that six months out from our exit from the European Union there is a signicant gap between where we are and where the department clearly wanted to be.”\n\nMr Nesbitt also queried the delays in filling vacancies against the backdrop of the recent civil service Voluntary Exit Scheme , which was brought in before the collapse of Stormont in January 2017.\n\n“The other key question relates to the fact that the underspend is explained, but not excused, by delays in filling vacancies, thus raising the question of whether the Voluntary Exit Scheme introduced by the last DUP/Sinn Fein coalition created those vacancies in the first place,” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA spokesman for the Department of Finance said: “The Voluntary Exit Scheme concluded in May 2016 before the European Union Membership Referendum on June 23 2016.\n\n“The preparations for EU Exit emerged after the Voluntary Exit Scheme it is not possible to determine  the VES has had any impact on the number of vacancies.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n

Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s monopoly poultry processor, Moy Park, in order to get public funds from a Stormont loan scheme.\n\n                \nIn his written evidence to the inquiry, Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton set out some of the huge sums of money it had made available to Moy Park.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Hamilton said that Stormont had agreed to provide £35m of public money to the poultry industry in an attempt to ensure “rapid investment in this sector”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, ultimately banks were willing to lend more than expected, so not all of this money was lent.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn reality, though, ‘the poultry industry’ seemed to be synonymous with Moy Park.\n\nHis evidence showed that in order to access the public funding, inidual farmers had to have a contract with Moy Park.\n\nOne of the criteria for accessing the funding was “Confirmation of the contractual agreement between the applicant and Moy Park”.\n\nMr Hamilton said: “Moy Park is the major processor of poultry in Northern Ireland, accounting for approximately 95% of the poultry processing industry in NI.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Hamilton also set out how Invest NI then provided Moy Park with more public money under a separate funding stream which saw it offered £9.5 million “to support job creation and capital growth”.\n\nMr Hamilton, a former special adviser  to Ian Paisley when he was First Minister, also defended the principle of having Spads.\n\nHaving come into the role from a 25-year career in BT, he said that he was “a very strong supporter of the role... when it is executed as it should be executed”.\n\nHe said he was not involved with any political party and he was recruited as an expert, rather than a party loyalist.\n\n

country singer \"Big Tom\" McBride has praised a new statue of him as a \"fitting tribute\".\n\n                \nIrish President Michael D Higgins unveiled the monument to Big Tom in Castleblayney on Sunday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe praised it as \"a wonderful testament to the popularity of Big Tom\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"That love for Big Tom, his music and the man he was is something that you know best but of course share, not only with people across our island of Ireland, not only in Irish communities across the world, but with many other peoples from dferent cultures,\" he said.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBig Tom, who was a huge star in the 60s and 70s, died in April aged 81, as the statue and festival in his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n

watch the first public presentation of military colours to the Royal Irish Regiment to take place in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nSenior Army personnel described the event as a momentous occasion that will be remembered for a long time.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHis Royal Highness The Duke of York meets the troops at the RIR presentation of

for the presentation of colours, which involved hundreds of soldiers from the RIR’s 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nColours are presented to regiments every 25 years, and represent both their history and their future.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nPresenting the new colours, HRH The Duke of York, colonel in chief of the RIR, described the regiment’s history as “proud and honourable”.\n\nDuring a short address to the regiment and spectators, Prince Andrew said: “Today, I would like to wish every single member of this fantastic regiment every good fortune as they clear the way for so much that is important not only to Her Majesty but also to the United Kingdom.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe Band

to protect and follow the colours as they are intended.”\n\nHe concluded by saying the Royal Irish motto, Faugh a Ballagh, which means “clear the way”.\n\n                            \n            \n

2006, were consecrated by Rev Dr David Coulter, chaplain general to HM Land Forces, before being presented and paraded through the ranks.\n\nThe Belfast man, undertaking his last official engagement before leaving the Army later this year, said: “I have the privilege of consecrating the colours. They then become sacred, so everywhere they are taken they are guarded, protected, looked after, and when they finish their time in service they are laid up in a sacred place to fade away.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHundreds of soldiers from 1 Royal Irish and 2 Royal Irish took part in Saturday\u0027s presentation of colours parade\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“It is a great privilege to be able to say prayers in front of those colours and to consecrate them for all time.”\n\nThe commanding officer of 1 Royal Irish, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Lewis, said it was “a big honour” to have HRH The Duke of York present the new colours to the regiment on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe audience included a number of former members of the regiment, including Ulster Unionist Party MLAs Doug Beattie MC and Andy Allen who praised the event.\n\nBrigadier  Joe O’Sullivan, honorary colonel of the Royal Irish Regiment described it as an “historic moment”.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHRH The Duke of York standing behind Wolfhound Major Robert Moore and Irish Wolfhound Brian Boru X who proudly led the men of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment on parade.
