Since 2010, 773 have closed.The number of paid librarians has also plummeted. In 20092010, the point marking the start of the Tory-led government’s austerity drive, there were 24,000 salaried staff working in libraries. Last year, there were 15,300 employees and more than 51,000 volunteers.As the number of branches and paid staff have declined, so have library visits: there were 226m visits to libraries over the last year, compared with 315m in 20092010.Cipfa chief executive Rob Whiteman said that while spending had increased slightly in the last year, the figures showed a sustained trend where local councils on tight budgets had been forced to redirect funding to priority services such as social care.“This is the shape of today’s local authorities. As the country prepares to go to the polls, candidates should be having honest conversations with the public about the role of local government, and the future of lower priority services such as libraries,” Whiteman said.Earlier this week, Boris Johnson was asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr about library closures, with the prime minister appearing to offload the blame on to local authorities, who have undergone dramatic cuts over the past decade. This year, council leaders warned that one in five councils might have to impose drastic spending controls to avoid bankruptcy.Johnson told Marr: “We want to be spending more. We want to be supporting local authorities. But some local authorities have been able to manage their finances so as to open libraries. I give you the example of my own borough of Hillingdon in west London, where they opened libraries … I want to invest in libraries, but we can only do that when we get the economy really motoring.” The prime minister said this could be achieved by “getting Brexit done”.Nick Poole, chief executive of librarian body Cilip, was harshly critical of Johnson’s comments, saying they include “three key misconceptions”. First, pointed out Poole, local library services are not the responsibility of local councils alone: the 1964 Public Libraries Act requires central government to oversee and improve public library services – a responsibility, he said, that the previous Conservative government failed to implement.“Finally, Mr Johnson appears to suggest that the country can only afford libraries when there has been an economic recovery. As we have commented time and again, this is a fundamentally misguided policy. By investing in libraries, you create opportunities for education and skills across the country, which in turn creates the conditions for future economic growth.”• This article was amended on 6 December 2019 to restore the word “not” (lost in editing) in this assertion attributed to Nick Poole: Local library services are not the responsibility of local councils alone. The presence of the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 cost-cutting government was also noted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26631244853c75fe401c2d0d3baee64e1442b2e9/47_1094_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9bab5e5835c9ebc84963b51065f00b3","title":"lisa taddeo interview three women","story":"The US journalist spent eight years talking to three women about sex and desire – and had no idea the result would be a publishing sensation. She tells Hadley Freeman what happened nextThe American author Lisa Taddeo would like some breakfast. But our waiter is thwarting her. “We don’t serve food in this part of the hotel, ma’am,” he says, adding that breakfast has finished when she suggests we move. “Is nothing available?” she persists. He barely restrains a sigh. “Is a croissant OK?” “Perfect!” she says, triumphant. With another sigh, he disappears in search of what Taddeo describes as “the illicit croissant”. She then leans over and whispers, “When he comes back I’m gonna freak him out and ask if I can now have scrambled eggs.”In the past year, Taddeo has gone from being a relatively little known journalist to one of the most celebrated authors of 2019, thanks to her extraordinary debut book about women’s appetites and desires, and how men frustrate and warp them. Three Women, which has been a bestseller in the US and the UK, tells the true stories of Maggie, Lina and Sloane, each of whom, for utterly personal and yet profoundly relatable reasons, has a complicated understanding of their own needs. Maggie alleges she had a sexual relationship with her high school teacher, Aaron Knodel, and we meet her as she’s dealing with the emotional and legal aftermath. After being raped by three classmates as a teenager, Lina married a cold, undemonstrative man, and is now, as a mother of two, embarking on a frantic affair with an old boyfriend. Elegant, privileged Sloane has sex with other people so her husband can get a thrill from watching.Taddeo spent more than eight years on the book, crossing America six times in search of her subjects. Even having a baby didn’t break her stride: she simply strapped her infant daughter into her sling and headed into bars in North Dakota, asking strangers if they would talk to her about their sex lives. “I don’t know if it made it more or less creepy that I had a baby with me. Probably more so,” she says with a laugh. At least, she adds, the baby’s presence generally reassured people she wasn’t propositioning them.Once she found her subjects, she spent months with them, even moving to their towns to be part of their daily lives. Her husband, Jackson Waite, a screenwriter, moved with her, taking on jobs in the various towns to keep them afloat: “He has a degree in fine art and photography, and he used it to make Christmas pictures in K-Mart when we were in Indiana. He was quite good at it! He often believed in the book more than I did,” she says.Taddeo’s immersion in her subjects’ lives is apparent in the amount of detail in the book, giving her lyrical reportage the depth of fiction. “Maggie would say, ‘So then we started kissing.’ And I’d say, ‘Wait, back up. Where were you sitting? What did you smell like? What were you wearing?’ I knew how interior I wanted to get.”Her efforts paid off: the book has been a huge success. Rachel Cooke in the Observer described it as “the best book on women and desire I have ever come across”. Dave Eggers wrote that it was “one of the most riveting, assured and scorchingly original debuts I’ve ever read”. (This was particularly gratifying: as a journalist, Taddeo had tried for years to write for Eggers’ literary journal, McSweeney’s Quarterly Concern.) The book feels ready made for a TV series, which is precisely what it is becoming: Taddeo, along with Waite, are adapting it for the US cable network Showtime.For Taddeo, who spent almost a decade isolating herself in research, the very public reaction has been astonishing. “I thought I was writing a quiet little book, I really did. So the whole thing has been shocking. I’m shocked.” She puts the success down largely to luck, but the book sparks such passions, especially among women, that there is obviously more to it. When I posted a photo of the book on Instagram with a rapt caption about my love for it, around three-quarters of my female friends agreed with me, while the rest told me I’d lost my mind.“We don’t want to see ourselves sometimes. That’s where the vitriol comes from, I think. I’ve always liked to see myself in books. When I read Mary Gaitskill’s Bad Behaviour I was like, ‘Oh yeah. These women are fucked up, too!’ But some people are like, ‘Those people are fucked up – I’m not like them.’ And maybe there are people who aren’t fucked up over desire, but I haven’t met them yet,” Taddeo says.In each of the women’s sections, which are told in alternating chapters, Taddeo drills down into the nuances. In the story of Maggie, which is probably the most instantly compelling, she blasts apart the cliches that shape the media coverage of so many sex abuse cases – Maggie, the child of alcoholics, was described as “troubled”, Knodel, North Dakota’s teacher of the year in 2014, was “a family man”. But Maggie’s family, we learn, was very close and loving, and Knodel was phoning her for late-night chats, after his family was asleep. Even those who believed Maggie’s story tell Taddeo, “She asked for it.” “But to me, Maggie Wilken did not ask for it. She accepted it, the way any child accepts any decoration, any gift,” Taddeo writes. Meanwhile, the first time Sloane watched her husband having sex with another woman, she felt “her actual soul melt out and skitter from the room”. But then she began to enjoy their open relationship and the complicated feeling of control over her husband it gave her: “She knew he liked to abdicate his power. She was happy to please him.”Some reviewers suggested the book was helped by the cresting interest in the #MeToo movement, but Three Women feels like a counterweight to all the discussions of sexual harassment and assault. While #MeToo focused on men’s unrestrained sexual desire and self-entitlement, Three Women is about how women control their own impulses to the point they become utterly orced from them. “Men can frighten us, other women can frighten us, and sometimes we worry so much about what frightens us that we wait to have an orgasm until we are alone. We pretend to want things we don’t want so nobody can see us not getting what we need,” Taddeo writes in a pair of typical punch-to-the-gut sentences.In person, Taddeo is larkier and more self-deprecating than she comes across in her writing, often making fun of her own phrasings (“God, I sound so – ugh!”). When I ask how the success of the book has changed her life, she says, “Other than that I get to fly around the world, not at all. My anxiety is still at fever pitch. I’m always wildly fearful about life and death.”Taddeo was born and raised in New Jersey. Her father died unexpectedly when she was 23, and within the next seven years she also lost her mother, her aunt, her uncle and her dog. “So I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop,” she says. As a result, she always travels with her daughter, who is now four. “I haven’t been away from her for a single night since she’s been born, and that’s not about pure motherly love – it’s about how, if I’m not there, I can’t control the situation,” she says.While Taddeo’s life hasn’t changed, her subjects’ have. She is still in frequent contact with them and, before publication, was concerned about how Maggie, the most vulnerable of the trio, would be affected. Knodel was acquitted of three of the charges against him – the other two were dropped after the judge ruled there had been a mistrial. As a result Maggie, unlike Lina and Sloane, wanted her real name to be used in the book she felt that her story had been dismissed, but now was the moment she could make herself heard. And that is exactly what has happened: since publication, Maggie and Taddeo have received thousands of messages from other young women who have gone through similar experiences. After years of being called a slut and a homewrecker, Maggie told Taddeo, the book has given her closure. Neither Knodel nor his lawyers have contacted Taddeo. I tell her this surprises me, as I can’t understand how she was able to write about a sexual relationship between Maggie and her teacher, given that he was acquitted. Taddeo smiles and says, with the suggestion of heavy understatement, “There was a lot of legal vetting. Lots of insertion of words like ‘allegedly.’ But it’s funny, only British readers ask me about that. Maybe in the US we’re more, ‘Whatever!’”Lina has largely ignored the book, preferring instead to concentrate on her new relationship and not look back, Taddeo says. I ask about Sloane. Surely, I say, people in her small town have recognised her. “Mmm it’s been a little tricky. Let’s just say no comment,” she says.Taddeo generally prefers to read fiction authors such as Lucia Berlin, Tessa Hadley, William Trevor and Elena Ferrante give her “the deep interiority” she looks for in storytelling. So it’s perhaps not surprising that she has written a non-fiction book that feels like a novel. But she has always been adept at mixing the genres: in 2008 she caused a minor media sensation with her Esquire article imagining the final days of Heath Ledger (Esquire called it “reported fiction”). As she was working on Three Women, she continued to jump back and forth over the border between fiction and reportage: in the lulls when she was waiting to find another subject, or to hear back from Sloane, she knocked out a novel and a collection of short stories. Both were bought by her publisher.The success of Three Women is a testament to Taddeo’s commitment but also a sign of how many women recognise that their desires aren’t met, and how relieved they are that someone is vocalising that. In that sense, the book is both a triumph of writing and a tragedy for women.“Totally. I wasn’t surprised by much during my research, but I was surprised at how strongly people related to it,” says Taddeo.The interview and croissant are finished, and she manages to get a coffee out of the reluctant waiter. She puts two, then three, then four sugar cubes in it, then looks up guiltily:“This is terrible, I’m sorry,” she says.I tell her she does not need to apologise for wanting some sugar.“I apologise for everything,” she says. “As a woman, I’ve apologised my whole life.”• Three Women is published by Bloomsbury (RRP £16.99).

Handke was set to give a press conference about his win at noon on Friday, with his laureate’s lecture due on Saturday. Formal presentation of his medal is timetabled for Tuesday.The Austrian writer’s win in October has proved highly controversial, with politicians and writers lining up to condemn his denial of Serb atrocities during the war in the former Yugoslavia, as well as his presence at the funeral of war criminal Slobodan Miloševic. The Kosovan ambassador to the US, Vlora Çitaku, has called the choice of Handke “scandalous … a preposterous and shameful decision”.Peter Maass, a journalist at the Intercept who has been critical of the choice of Handke, said Englund’s move was stunning. “Stunning because the Academy is small – just 18 seats – and Englund is the only member with firsthand experience in Bosnia (where Handke is accused of genocide denial),” he wrote on Twitter.Earlier this week, two members of the external committee set up to oversee reforms to the Swedish Academy following a sex scandal quit, with Gun-Britt Sundstrom saying her decision was linked to the choice of Handke. “The choice of 2019 laureate was not just a choice about a body of work, it has also been interpreted, both inside the academy and outside, as a defence of the stance that literature is above ‘politics’,” she told Dagens Nyheter. “That is not my ideology.”Kristoffer Leandoer said he was leaving the committee “because I have neither the patience nor the time to wait for the result of the work to change that has been started … The academy and I have a different perspective on time, one year is far too long in my life and far too short in the life of the academy,” he said, in his case adding that his decision was not linked to the choice of Handke.The Swedish Academy has been tight-lipped about the reasons for its choice, although Maass has highlighted how Anders Olsson, chair of its Nobel committee, has responded to criticism from public figures in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina.Olsson told Mehmet Kraja, president of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in Kosovo: “It is clear that Handke is understood in different ways … When Handke is awarded the prize, the ambition is to celebrate his extraordinary literary work, not the person … We should strive to respect each other notwithstanding sharply erging views in important matters.”On Thursday, Maass repeatedly attempted to get the Nobel Foundation and the Swedish Academy to explain the choice of Handke. “The institutions responsible for Peter Handke winning this award … are hoping they can continue to dodge direct questions about what they have done,” he wrote on Twitter. “I’m a journalist, half my life has been spent getting brushed off. But this is the Nobel prize for literature and it has been awarded to a writer who is reliably accused of genocide denial. This is different.”Handke is the winner of the 2019 Nobel prize for literature. The winner of the 2018 award, Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, was also announced in October. Tokarczuk, who is using part of her Nobel winnings to set up a foundation to support the work of writers and translators and to help “describe the reality in which xenophobic and nationalist sentiments are growing dangerously quickly”, has not publicly commented about Handke’s politics. But her translator Jennifer Croft tweeted that it was absurd to make Tokarczuk share the stage with a “genocide apologist”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b3dcf4b82a9663ffd312bc7e5be4b010c8d500/18_0_3978_2387/master/3978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40afc2e86ab13332099228398c023d98","title":"john lewis to offshore contact centre jobs as uk staff laid off","story":"Staff in Plymouth say they are being asked to train workers in Philippines to replace themJohn Lewis is to offshore hundreds of call-centre jobs to the Philippines as part of a cost-cutting move that has already led to 300 UK workers being laid off just before Christmas.More than 300 staff at the Plymouth call centre, which is owned and run on John Lewis’s behalf by the US outsourcing giant Sitel, have either left or been made redundant.John Lewis has denied it is moving the Plymouth jobs to the far east but admitted that it expanded its Manila operation in March. It now has 180 staff handling “non-verbal” John Lewis customer service queries.Two months ago, John Lewis announced a restructuring in an effort to save £100m a year. One in three senior head office management posts – 75 out of 225 – are going. The department store group had just reported its first ever loss, of £26m in six months.Sacked staff at the Sitel Plymouth site, some of whom have worked on the John Lewis contract for two years, are furious after being asked to train workers in the Philippines on how to take over their roles.“Colleagues are feeling badly let down by the company. The stupid thing is that we all know that it will come to back to haunt John Lewis as customer service standards will slip even further.” Another worker said: “It seems ludicrous. People have trained for the last year or two to get to grips with the complexity of the John Lewis customer services systems. New people with no cultural experience will be starting from scratch in the Philippines.”Charlotte Holloway, the Labour candidate for Plymouth Moor View, said: “To be laid off five days before Christmas is a real kick in the teeth. To then learn that your job is being moved to the far east to save money is a double blow. It’s hardly in keeping with the ethos of John Lewis. I really hope the retailer reconsiders this decision that will have a big effect on the local economy.”Sitel declined to comment. A John Lewis spokeswoman said: “The reduction of the scale of our operations at the site in Plymouth is in no way related to the small operation which launched from an international Sitel site over a year ago. The changes at the Plymouth site are part of a wider strategy to strengthen the capacity of our UK in-house contact centres, which are run by John Lewis Partners.”This is not the first time the company has been involved in a controversial outsourcing deal. In 2015, it signed a five-year contract for Capita to provide online aftercare from a contact centre in Glasgow. Customers reported a decline in service standards around the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3de7a396dae6978f91efdb488ec4c54945c2b95/0_176_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b89e443b42128c14e16676063349f07","title":"facebook political ads social media","story":"I know abuses have given online ads a bad name, but banning them isn’t the answerMost people celebrated when Twitter announced its ban on political ads in October, and for good reason – there’s a lot wrong with the current state of political campaigning online. But as the first Facebook employee who worked on paid political marketing in Europe, I am convinced that simply banning political ads on social media fixes nothing in my opinion, it encourages inflammatory, polarising rhetoric and drives campaign money elsewhere. I believe that digital platforms are legitimate campaign spaces, and politics could actually be improved – through increased democratic participation and civic engagement – if big tech made the efforts to fix digital political advertising, rather than just banning it. Here are three steps Twitter, Facebook, Google and the like could take today.Social profiling by data companies has existed for many years, in political and commercial marketing. But the intersection of data and digital has created ways to target messages so precisely that it now feels possible for advertisers to reach inside consumers’ minds. When that data is acquired from dubious sources – such as Cambridge Analytica – people feel violated and manipulated.Some political campaigns have used third-party data and digital to honest ends, but many others – particularly here in GDPR-protected Europe – refuse to do so, and still manage to be effective and successful. Though Cambridge Analytica was a global scandal and exposed lax data controls, the belief internally at Facebook – and one I still hold now I’ve left – is that the actual impact of its dodgy data on elections was overstated. Political campaigns don’t need to connect big data and digital, and the methods can be abused – so big tech should just put an end to it.At the moment, political campaigns can upload their own data to Facebook to target voters with ads – a process called “custom audiences” – but Facebook has no way of knowing where these custom audience lists came from, and whether they were sourced legitimately or purchased from third parties.Banning the use of off-platform data sources – whether that’s email lists of party members, voter files or dubiously purchased contact lists from data companies – for political ads, as Google has just announced, would immediately provide reassurance that the sort of creepy micro-targeted ads we have seen proliferate will be no more. If tech firms were to restrict ad targeting only to location and demographics, campaigning would survive – the appropriate messages would still reach the right people, but without the violation and manipulation.Facebook is trying to do this already, but all other digital platforms should follow suit. Since 2018, the Facebook ad library – a searchable website that anyone can access – has kept a record of all the adverts relating to politics and elections that have run on the social network. By publishing political ads, their targeting and the amount spent on them, there is now greater public scrutiny of campaign messaging and methodologies than ever before. When we launched the ad library during my final months at Facebook, there were difficult phone calls and fraught email exchanges with some of my political clients. They were initially concerned that their campaign strategies might be exposed, though they soon gleefully realised their rivals’ would be, too. We knew the process of authorising people to run political ads, and then publishing them, was going to ruffle some feathers in European parties, but ultimately would be worth it.The library has in itself ended some of the shadier practices: once it began requiring advertisers’ names and addresses in the UK, the flow of ads from a notoriously obscure pro-Brexit organisation immediately ceased.All digital publishers should follow suit and bring an end to dark ads. Banning political ads outright, however, would push campaigning back into the shadows – and less ethical campaigns would just find more underhand ways to reach voters.Facebook has tried to address the proliferation of fake news, misinformation and flat-out lying on social media, paying independent third-party fact-checkers (such as journalists and civil society organisations) to review and classify content. This fact-checking has not, however, been applied to “political speech”, as one campaign’s election pledge could be another campaign’s fake news.Tech firms should show more imagination in responding to this challenge. While I appreciate their reluctance to become arbiters of political speech, by definitively saying whether something is “true” or “false” there are still steps that could be taken. Flags could be placed on ads to alert viewers that details within the content have been disputed by other parties, or that the origin of a video or image has been questioned. Include these “grey area” flags on ads in the public library and soon you’d be able to see whether a campaign is being consistently untruthful or publishing dubious content. In cases where a claim made in a political ad could be demonstrably proven to be false, this ad should not be allowed to run.Facebook’s own employees are confident there can be a middle ground on fact-checking, which neither mandates the tech firm to shut down freedom of speech nor allows the current free-for-all to continue unchecked. In my five years working with political ads, I joined many smart, ethical people at Facebook grappling with the unexpected challenges we were facing, and trying hard to come up with the right responses. My guess is that the current intransigence is a question of financing. Although many may think that big tech earns big sums from political ads, it doesn’t – as is clear from the data that Google shares about the political advertising it runs. Meanwhile, every investment the sector makes in stamping out abuses costs money – potentially more than some firms are making from political advertising in the first place.But when Silicon Valley sets such lofty missions as “connect the world” and “do no evil”, it has a moral obligation to put its money where its mouth is. Right now, big tech needs to invest whatever it takes to fix the mess digital platforms have created. And if that’s means raising the retainer fees for their fact-checkers, or hiring five times as many of them – so be it. They can afford it. And they owe it to democracy.• Clare O’Donoghue Velikić was the government and politics client partner at Facebook, where she founded the political ads team for Europe, until July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4de5b95bb3128035abd926b4056efcaa7fc3279b/0_189_5027_3017/master/5027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b69ee2e5abdbab936c810b693643d21f","title":"labour strong economic plan voters faith austerity","story":"A lost decade for the British economy is coming to a suitably downbeat end. The latest snapshots of business activity point to stagnant growth in the final three months of the year and it could be even worse than that. If the economy decides elections, the Conservatives should be heading for a thumping defeat next week. They have been in power for nine years, their record is unimpressive, confidence is low, and they are offering little in the way of tax cuts and spending increases.In the circumstances, the idea that the Conservatives might win seats next week rather than suffer a heavy defeat takes some explaining.It may have something to do with the fact that the actual state of the economy has played little part in the election. The Conservatives are ahead in the polls despite their dire record. Wages adjusted for inflation are lower than they were when the financial crisis erupted businesses have not invested productivity growth has been nugatory. The prime minister’s pledge to unleash the potential of the British people is a slogan not a policy.The notion that once Brexit is done everything will be all right is staggeringly complacent. Fundamental defects in the economy were exposed a decade ago and have not been tackled. The Conservative manifesto offers only tinkering when more radical action is needed to lift the UK out of its low wage, low growth rut and to prepare it for the challenges – from the climate emergency to paying for the costs of an ageing population – that lie ahead. The focus on Brexit has been relentless: clearly a decision has been taken not to make the economy a campaign issue.Boris Johnson’s poll lead is all the more extraordinary given that the Conservatives have abandoned austerity – the policy that got them into power in 2010 and helped win them an overall majority in 2015. The Tory manifesto accepts the argument that it makes sense for the government to borrow to invest in public infrastructure at a time when private sector investment is weak and the state can take advantage of historically low borrowing costs. Funnily enough, this is what the critics of austerity have said all along.The Conservatives seem reluctant to take advantage of the opportunity to borrow cheaply. By the end of a five-year parliament they would be investing £8bn more than currently planned. By comparison, Labour’s plans involve an extra £55bn in borrowing – and that does not include what might be needed to compensate the so-called “Waspi women” over the changes to the female retirement age.If the polls are right, though, the Conservatives are more in tune with the public mood than Labour. Focus group after focus group has thrown up the same response to Jeremy Corbyn’s goodie-laden manifesto: how will it all be paid for?Politicians have moved, but the public – or at least a large part of it – is still stuck in 2010 when David Cameron and George Osborne made political headway with the notion that if companies and iniduals were cutting their borrowing it made sense for the government to do the same. The idea that everybody should be retrenching at the same time was superficially attractive yet profoundly stupid, but it has proved hard to dislodge.The public’s suspicion of borrowing has been fanned by two factors: the increase in personal debt over the past decade and the scale of Labour’s ambition. If you are proposing to increase the size of the state to the levels seen in a continental European country such as Germany, then you have to take the public with you. That means banging away – as remorselessly as the Conservatives have over Brexit – that government borrowing can be like taking out a cheap mortgage to buy a house at a knockdown price.If Labour goes down to a fourth successive defeat next week it won’t be because people think the economy is poised for sustainable growth. It won’t be because they think the Tories have done a great job. It won’t be because every other issue has been crowded out by Brexit. It isn’t, they haven’t and it hasn’t been. It will be because Labour has not done the dull but essential groundwork needed to convince enough voters that its plans stack up.The result is that it has the same problem it always has: convincing voters that it has its head screwed on as well as its heart in the right place. That mattered even when Tony Blair was proposing merely to tinker in 1997 it matters even more when you are promising to rewrite the rules of the economy.Unlike the Tories, Labour is not complacent about the state of the economy and its strategy has a logic to it. Stage one involves offering lots of free stuff – from broadband to dental checkups – to get into power. Stage two involves quick early wins – raising the minimum wage to £10 an hour and a redistributive budget. Stage three involves longer-term changes to the economy using the tools of nationalisation and state-driven investment. Stage four involves telling Middle Britain that it will have to pay higher taxes to pay for a bigger state, but only after the changes made in stages one, two and three have delivered higher living standards.For now, voters are merely picking up on stage one, the ever-increasing list of freebies. Corbyn’s chances of becoming prime minister would be massively boosted if the campaign’s last days were used to order what looks like a scattergun approach into a coherent list of priorities and a plan for action.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22426704b85aba3f6fa0d070c97eacf1de51eca9/0_21_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b65cb64f3312f2c96a0902f6307133f","title":"nurses northern ireland strike stormont dup sinn fein","story":"At one minute past midnight on Tuesday, the UK’s (and the world’s) largest nursing union, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), commenced strike action for the first time in its 103-year existence. While the rest of the UK isn’t without its own broader healthcare concerns, it’s perhaps no surprise that the historic industrial action is taking place in Northern Ireland.Following negotiations over the last few months, a breakdown in talks between the country’s barely functioning Department of Health and its health unions has led to thousands of workers being left with no option but to protest over pay parity and unsafe staffing levels. In the past few days alone, 10,000 outpatient appointments have been cancelled due to the start of the industrial action. A full 12-hour strike is scheduled for 18 December.There’s no debate to be had here: Northern Ireland’s health professionals have been backed into a terrible corner by the cowardice of the country’s non-sitting Stormont government. The industrial action is vital and the numbers behind the issues speak for themselves. According to the latest figures, there are 2,484 registered nurse vacancies and 454 nursing support worker vacancies in the country. In September alone, the 12-hour target for A\u0026ampE waiting times was breached 3,482 times, while 306,000 people (that’s one in six people in the country) were on hospital waiting lists for their first appointment. The situation has gone from severe to unworkable.While the growing pay gap is also a major issue, safe staffing is a much bigger and broader concern. Put simply, there aren’t enough staff employed to deal with the workload. Nurses have been put under unworkable pressure, which is exacerbated by knowing that the risk to patients is potentially catastrophic. Safe staffing levels save lives, therefore these strikes do not negate the compassion or professionalism of Northern Ireland’s nurses.Having failed to take their seats in Stormont since 9 January, 2017 – following reprehensible disagreements over abortion rights, the Irish language and the recognition of same-sex marriage – Northern Ireland’s leading political parties, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and Sinn Féin, must accept the buck stops with them. While the current crisis has been in gestation for years, recently the RCN and Unison have had no choice but to attempt to draw blood from the stone that is the Northern Irish civil service, in lieu of a functioning executive government and an active health minister in Stormont. No matter how they may try to swing it, the DUP and Sinn Féin have created a gaping political void that’s prevented the reasonable requests of health professionals being heard.In a typically vapid article for the Belfast , the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, spoke of her desire to see Stormont back up and running. “The DUP understands and shares the frustrations of the public that we have not been able to get things done locally,” she said. “Strike action by nurses and other hard-working staff could be avoided and the pay rise can be delivered.”Sure enough, empty vessels make the most noise and, as time has told us, Foster robotically wields such guff in times of crisis but has only been actively motivated to bring Stormont back in order to further her party’s prehistoric agenda over abortion rights and gay marriage legislation. It’s the antithesis of sleight of hand: her words only serve to emphasise the DUP’s (and, in tandem, Sinn Féin’s) failings to represent the country it was elected to.While the political blame game in Northern Ireland has long been pantomime-esque, the reality here can’t be glossed over with casual deflection or kneejerk platitudes. In the 1,000-plus days that it has been suspended, Stormont has cost the taxpayer in excess of £100m. This fact, framed by the health crisis and paired with entrenched patterns of bigotry and discrimination within the DUP, in particular, means that the reestablishment of Northern Ireland’s executive has never felt more vital.• Brian Coney is a writer and editor living in Belfast"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2b29a69afc4826da414b48da5521ace4664b8a/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f45748776cbb930cd78a175eab309ba","title":"tories victory stats tell different story labour youthquake","story":"Labour has made significant gains in the polls over the past few weeks – and, as in 2017, a ‘youthquake’ looks likelyIs history about to repeat itself? With less than a week to go until Britain’s third general election in five years, the Conservatives have failed to confront any of the shortcomings that led to them losing their majority in 2017. Their manifesto offered nothing new in terms of policy for young people or remain voters – two key groups who voted overwhelmingly against the Conservatives in 2017. Boris Johnson’s campaign has instead focused on winning the support of leave voters, attempting to avoid making any new promises and relentlessly criticising Jeremy Corbyn.At first glance, this strategy would appear to be working: in the fourth week of the election campaign, the Conservatives were 10 points ahead of Labour on average in the polls, and on a universal swing would have won a majority of 46 seats. But beneath the headline figures in the polls, the numbers tell a story that should leave the Conservatives deeply worried.In 2017, there were three main factors that scuppered the Conservatives’ hopes of winning an overall majority: a surge in support for the Labour party in the polls a massive increase in youth turnout and support for Labour among young people and remain voters swinging their support behind Labour as the most viable alternative to the Conservatives. All of these things are now happening again.In short, the idea that this election is a foregone conclusion is as incorrect as it was in 2017. Labour has made significant gains in the polls over the past few weeks, and the events of 2017 are largely being repeated. The Corbyn surge, the “youthquake”, the collapse in support for minor parties and the enthusiasm among Labour supporters – all these things occurred in 2017, and have occurred again. A slight error in the polls – such as the kind that occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017 – could see Corbyn enter No 10.• Ell Smith is the founder of Stats for Lefties, a blog and podcast that examines polls and elections"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71feb3bb4c0ca18507e33b573feb0a0fea87985c/0_0_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68abd45222073b2f386bf5880d4ec533","title":"spotify wrapped users alarmed by their own listening habits","story":"Streaming service gave subscribers a look back at their entire decade of music consumptionSpotify’s annual Wrapped feature, which reveals users’ favourite music from the past year, has been released to its 243 million users, prompting mixed emotions among subscribers.The feature has become an anticipated event for regular users as it shows their most played songs, top artists, favourite genres and minutes listened for the year.

Come summer, Alberta’s five national parks become the perfect backdrop for everything from wildlife spotting, cycling and rock climbing to rafting and gazing at the stars in one of the region’s dark sky preserves. But beyond the mountains, you’ll find both small-town charm, such as Lake Louise inside Banff National Park, and cosmopolitan buzz in Alberta’s urban hubs, Calgary and Edmonton.Besides the mountains, the province’s other great natural feature is its prairies. Alberta is cowboy country, and that means beef – namely Alberta’s famous AAA beef – is a staple of menus across the province. Head to the Longview Steakhouse, where the setting is casual but the food hearty and high-end, for a quintessentially Albertan experience with valley views. Or dine amid the forest at Tekarra. This log cabin, perched above the Athabasca River near Jasper, has been serving illustrious patrons, including Marilyn Monroe, since 1952.A new star in the contemporary culinary scene is Deane House. Set in a century-old Calgary mansion, dishes focus on seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Or tuck into the tastiest trattoria-style food at Bread \u0026amp Circus, nominated as one of Canada’s best new restaurants in 2018. And if you want to buy produce, you’re in luck – Edmontonians love a farmers’ market, with no less than 16 held weekly during the summer.It’s not just the restaurants making the most of locally sourced ingredients craft beer and spirits are booming, as entrepreneurs also make use of Alberta’s natural larder. Head to the Park Distillery in Banff for the aptly named Glacier Rye whisky, made with glacier water from Banff National Park. The multi-award-winning Eau Claire – makers of Alberta’s first craft single malt whisky – uses ingredients harvested from farms in southern Alberta.Edmonton’s nickname as “festival city” is well-earned. No matter the season, there’s a festival in town. The Edmonton International Fringe Festival – the largest, longest running fringe festival in North America – is held each August. Watch the streets of Old Strathcona fill with performers, from circus acts to standup comedians. Calgary, too, is no slouch when it comes to getting into the party spirit – it even has its own Music Mile, a mile-long stretch of 9th Avenue SE bursting with music venues, including the Ironwood Stage and Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre. But long before there was a city here in Alberta, bison roamed, and First Nations people lived off the land. Take in 6,000 years of plains culture at the evocatively and aptly named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump cliff. The Unesco world heritage site, 14 miles west of Fort Macleod, was an important hunting site for First Nations communities. Today a visitor centre houses prehistoric artefacts and offers tours of the site.A tri-area lift ticket gets you access to Mount Norquay, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village – revered by skiers and boarders worldwide as one of the top places in the world to seek out feather-light snow. For the more adventurous, Fortress Mountain, located on the Kananaskis Trail, 70 miles west of Calgary, offers skiers and riders of intermediate-plus level the chance to go in search of virgin snow. Head to Castle Mountain to go cat-skiing, where you’ll have access to untouched powder so dry and light it’s nicknamed “liquid smoke”.If you’re after a more tranquil experience, take to the water in summer. Rent a canoe or kayak in Banff National Park and explore the waterways of the Bow Valley, including 40 Mile Creek and Vermilion Lakes. Or ride the backcountry mountain trails on horseback, camping out in the wilderness with a riding holiday.Alberta’s ski-heaven winters and fine summers may draw the crowds, but make no mistake, one of the best times to visit is autumn. Take a hike up to Larch Valley in late September, starting at the unbelievably photogenic Moraine Lake , to see the trees turn a flaming yellow amid the wisps of the season’s first snow. The two-and-a-half-mile hike will take you from the spectacular turquoise waters backed by the ice-capped Valley of Ten Peaks, up to a high alpine meadow. Then there’s stargazing in Jasper, where you’ll find one of the world’s largest dark sky preserves. Every October, the Dark Sky Festival holds a number of events from symphonies under the stars to rocket building workshops.Of course, winter is magical in the Rockies. And that’s not just because of the skiing: stave off the January blues in Banff with the 11-day long Snow Days Festival, centred around massive snow sculptures in downtown Banff.

But as those waters have warmed, their numbers have fallen drastically.Tribal leaders in Sitka have long called for better protection of herring, a fish that holds cultural as well as economic significance for the people here. To demand protection of the sac roe herring fishery on which their way of life depends, they are taking the Alaskan government to court.For the subsistence harvesters of sac roe herring in the sound, this decline has been accelerated by what they see as the failure of the government to manage the herring fishery properly. Since 2002, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) has been appealing to the board of fisheries with proposals to protect the herring population.The scale of the decline was underlined in April, with the cancellation of an annual derby that usually sees hundreds of boats from the North Pacific gather in Sitka before setting sail for two to three days’ fishing. This year, not a single ship left the port and not a single herring was caught.The Sitka tribe, of more than 4,000 people, welcomed cancellation of the derby by Alaska’s department of food and game. But the move doesn’t reverse a decade of decline. While in 2009 the derby had celebrated a record fishing season, by 2018 the Sitka sac roe herring fishery was forced to close early because the herring were too scarce and too small.It was the fourth time in eight years that the herring fishery had shut down early without meeting the quota, following early closures in 2012, 2013 and 2016. In 2018 the department had expected a catch of more than 11,000 tonnes of sac roe herring, but not even 3,000 tonnes were produced, according to its own report.While the commercial industry harvests the eggs from inside the fish once caught, subsistence harvesters set out hemlock branches after the fleet leaves, where herring spawn and lay their eggs. Native Alaskans have been harvesting herring in this way for centuries but, in recent years, they have been pulling up branches bare. They say herring spawn now only cover a fraction of the coastline, and fear is mounting within the Sitka tribe that local stocks are on the verge of collapse.At the heart of the dispute with Alaska’s authorities is the question of whether the herring – which feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton and is a key food for salmon, seabirds and marine mammals – is designated a forage fish. The STA wants the species to be included on a forage fish management plan, acknowledging its importance in the Alaskan food web.The Sitka tribe also want Alaskan authorities to decrease the size of the herring that can be taken to market in order to protect the species, but say their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Herring return to spawn for up to seven years, each year growing larger depending on conditions in the ocean. It takes a fish at least five years to reach the size and roe maturity that processors want.In 2018, the fisheries board turned down a proposal to reduce the level of the commercial catch, and last December STA launched legal action in the superior court to demand a new management plan for the fishery. The Sitka tribe also want the court to find the actions of the fisheries board department of food and game illegal.A spokesperson for the STA explained the action, saying: “The time is now to ensure that our people have the chance to fulfil their cultural responsibilities, which have been interwoven with the herring since time immemorial, and to fill their freezers. We cannot sit by while the state of Alaska shirks its statutory and constitutional duties to citizens. We demand action by the state.”The trial – the culmination of more than two decades of concern over declining herring for the Sitka tribe – has been set for January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe8b59ed0cdc8164199a92c0fe1a560fdfe21f79/0_40_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ca9cf69be9013cf7a11d3e5e8717cc","title":"fork out to pork out germany schnitzel alert echoes around europe","story":"Sharp rise in wholesale pork prices prompts warnings over cost of bratwurst, chorizo and other seasonal fare BVDF, the federal association of the German meat industry, warned consumers that price rises meant some of their favourite national specialities, such as schnitzel and bratwurst, were going to be more expensive over Christmas.“Sausage is definitely more expensive,” the association’s president, Sarah Dhem, told German newspaper Bild.Chorizo manufacturers in Spain are also worried about the rise.Even in Denmark, one of the world’s foremost producers of pork – and the home of Danish Bacon – admits it may have a problem.“We have also met higher prices from our suppliers,” said a spokesperson for Salling Group, one of the country’s largest retailers. “But we are trying to keep our prices towards customers as competitive as possible, not least during the Christmas season.”In some European countries the problems caused by pork price rises are being compounded by outbreaks of African swine fever, which means that exports from certain zones are banned.

With neon, a little goes a long wayHi-vis used to be reserved for cyclists, or fans of the early Lady Gaga looks. Then Instagram happened and an Insta-worthy outfit became all about the standout visual – and so the neon boom began. Menswear designers, from the more traditional (Calvin Klein, Burberry) to the purveyors of cutting-edge streetwear (Off-White, Vetements), have incorporated it into their designs. You can see its domination everywhere: on the ’Gram, where too-cool-for-muted-blue pop stars like Bad Bunny and J Balvin unabashedly push the neon agenda and on Love Island, where it loomed large via the eye-popping swimwear. Back here on terra firma, however, wearing hi-vis could simply mean you’re holding a sign for a golf sale.Perhaps the best approach to cracking the “how to work neon” conundrum is via a well-thought-out accessory, such as a scarf or hat. Here, I’m wearing a beanie in a lollipop-lady-referencing shade of fluoro, twinned with a muted blue twill jacket. This feels like a good way of raising the fun stakes: my hat provides a not-so-subtle way of lifting a boring winter outfit without frightening the oncoming traffic. With neon, a little goes a long way (see also: gloves and socks). The multicoloured sports shoe is also an option but, be warned, you could look a bit “dad on the lash”, which might not be what you’re gunning for. What I’m wearing, AKA “the rave beanie”, is an undersung member of the winter hat family – think of it as the crazy aunt of the bucket hat and the acid house bandana.I have to admit it still feels a little weird, however, partly because my outfit reminds me of the Global Hypercolor days of the 90s, but also because the focus is on my hat, rather than, say, my top or jeans. It’s a bit like getting Destiny’s Child back together and giving Michelle the lead on Survivor, while Beyoncé is consigned to the back doing the “ooohs”.Still, it’s all about the outfit as a whole and, alongside the jacket, I feel I’ve accessorised it with a facial expression that screams: “If you remember the 90s you weren’t doing it properly!” I think I’d definitely be a hit on the ’Gram.

She is dating handsome young auto mechanic Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) and they are very happy, but she is devastated when Guy is called up for military service in Algeria, and even more upset when he stops writing to her. Meanwhile, her mother has serious money worries and is steering poor, bewildered Geneviève into smiling on the wealthy young man, Roland (Marc Michel), who wants to marry her.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg ripples across the screen in a rainbow of pretty pastel colours and a breathy susurration of high notes (the kind of thing affectionately pastiched by The Flight of the Conchords in their classic Foux-Da-Fa-Fa spoof), and I have to admit I have been a bit agnostic about it, retaining a little scepticism even now, despite warming up to the unworldly charm and almost childlike sincerity and poignancy that Demy conjures up. And the movie has its impressive coherence of design, although there is something approaching sketch comedy in the early sequence in which Geneviève and Guy are floating along the pavement, their feet not touching the ground.Yet Michel Legrand’s score is for me sometimes thin, shrill and repetitive, straining in a high register and it can sound weirdly the same, no matter what the film’s ostensible mood. Guy’s description of three soldiers being killed and of being attacked with hand grenades is sung with that same sugary, insouciant melodic jauntiness.But Deneuve brings to the film her own subtly erotic discontent and muted sadness. There is a great moment when Roland says to Geneviève that she reminds him of a painting: “A Virgin and Child I saw in Antwerp.” Of course, that ill-chosen, and unromantic remark is supposed to show how cold, how bloodless and unpassionate Roland is compared to Guy – the sexy blue-collar guy who works with his hands, as opposed to this wealthy, well-travelled art connoisseur.The irony is that he is right: the sad, hollow-eyed, pale Deneuve really does look like a sacrificial figure in a religious painting. She has an intensity that is always on the verge of being wrong for this movie. Yet, without it, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg would be simply sucrose.

If uncertainty began to take root during those teenage years they would put him straight immediately, keeping his focus trained on the dream that had always consumed him.“I wanted to be playing in an academy and, as time went on, I was thinking: ‘Time’s catching up, when’s it going to happen?’” he says. “Sometimes I’d be like: ‘Maybe it won’t work out for me.’ And they’d quickly go: ‘What are you talking about? God’s given you this talent for a reason, don’t ever give up on it.’It is a sentiment that comes to mind now because this is not the easiest of times. Lookman has just come inside from an hour and a half’s training with RB Leipzig and, make no mistake, he has looked the part out there. In an 11-a-side match crammed into two-thirds of a pitch and containing its fair share of hard knocks, he has scored a couple of sharp finishes and to the naked eye has responded well to Julian Nagelsmann’s constant demands for “intensität”. But on a match day, when it really matters, Lookman has had only 201 minutes all season. Leipzig, a point off the Bundesliga summit, are flying but on a personal level the move he sought for more than a year has yet to catch light.“This time around it’s definitely different,” says Lookman, whose loan from Everton in the second half of 2017-18 brought five goals, a series of sparkling performances and a clamour for his return. “The first time it was like a leap of faith, but this time it’s more like ‘go’ time. The club has changed, the team is stronger – a lot stronger – and there’s a new coach, so it’s something I have to adapt to.”It was, he says, a “no-brainer” to come back in July when the clubs finally agreed a fee. Last season it had been hard, initially, to get over the disappointment when Everton rejected two offers. “At the beginning it was,” he says. “But then thinking of that was hurting me. If I was thinking, ‘I wish I was there’ then I’d be like, ‘How’s that going to help my situation now?’” He knuckled down and received some reassurances from Marco Silva but a breakthrough never really came. Only three starts in the league ensued and he admits it was hard, at times, to wonder what was going wrong when those ahead of him were hardly firing on all cylinders.That was another situation in which Des and Felix, who stopped him going “off-topic”, proved invaluable. Their advice appears to work because Lookman, for all the stop-start nature of his career to date, hardly seems low on confidence. He talks fondly and at length about Waterloo, a club set up two decades ago to provide a supportive and inclusive community for youngsters in disadvantaged parts of Lambeth and Southwark, but in the same breath as recalling the leaf-strewn, bobbly, sloped picture of his youth he is unhesitant in stating: “This is my stage now.”The players who came through at Waterloo were “a bunch of brothers”, he remembers. “We were a top team. Dead serious. All should be playing at a top level all 16 of us, including the subs, were good enough. Some of them are now in uni or working and some of them are playing football part-time.”He was picked up by Charlton after a trial game in 2013, reaching the first team within a little over two years. Looking back he wonders whether his truncated format football education has held him back in some way. “Yes and no. There are some things I’d love to have learned. Tactically there are things I’m not too sure about and I’d definitely have learned that inside an academy. But there was never a time when I wasn’t getting coached. I was playing with my friends and that was cool.”Much of Lookman’s conversation is lighthearted, peppered with little asides that underscore his confidence in things coming good. Nagelsmann, the prodigious 32-year-old coach, has told him “to play with freedom” and encouraged him to back his ability. “If I have to think about what I’m going to do I don’t do it well,” he says. “When I’m instinctive I do things off the cuff and it just comes naturally.”By then he will hope to have proved his worth at Leipzig. Life under Nagelsmann has meant adapting to a possession-based style that informed onlookers say is as complex as any they have seen. After a long pause he agrees he has never quite worked in conditions like these but the winter break is coming and the expectation is he will receive far more game time from January.During those weeks off he will develop himself off the pitch too: when he is alone in his apartment he reads assiduously and enjoys watching speeches and lectures by people who inspire him, with Denzel Washington a current favourite.“I just like to learn about different people,” he says. “Even if I watch something 10 times, every time I’ll learn something different, take it and use it.”The relative quiet of Leipzig sits well with Lookman. Despite the frustration of the last five months he is certain he is in the right place, even if young English players have not always taken easily to a continental setting.“Yeah, it’s happened,” he says. “But in my case it was successful first time, and this time it will be even more successful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c59db5f93875194960b1e47c2ab1bc023c03b0/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ae399adec33a87819488bab24eb746","title":"manchester city united derby guardiola solskjaer","story":"Liverpool’s stellar form, a weakness in central defence and a group of players who before Tuesday’s 4-1 thumping of Burnley lacked an edge are key factors for Manchester City being 11 points behind the Merseyside club. Pep Guardiola rates the midfielder Fernandinho over John Stones or Nicolás Otamendi as first-choice cover for the injured centre-back Aymeric Laporte, illuminating how the failure to acquire an A-list replacement for Vincent Kompany was a serious error. The win at Turf Moor was a reminder of how energy and effervescence from the manager’s pass-and-move play had dipped: given the deficit this has to remain until May.United, seven points above the drop zone and eight off fourth, made their poorest start since 1988. Here Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, is culpable for a recruitment policy that created a malaise during the five years before Ole Gunnar Solskjær became manager. Wednesday’s impressive win over Tottenham is proof of what the Norwegian is hoping to build.Attempting to predict whether United will embark upon an upward trajectory remains a conundrum because Solskjær’s side are young and callow. Yet the results against Chelsea (4-0), Liverpool (1-1), Leicester (1-0) and Spurs (2-1) show how impressive United can be against the ision’s toughest opponents. It has to allow optimism that given time the Solskjær project will be successful. This means he has to be in place next summer for a second close-season window.City are at a defining moment of Guardiola’s reign: can he and his champions respond despite a third consecutive title seeming remote? The manager will hope his side’s experience of losing at Newcastle in January of last season and then reeling off 14 consecutive victories to retain the championship can be drawn on. Tuesday’s win was a reminder of why City are formidable and, if Liverpool do stumble at all, Guardiola’s men will hope peak form remains to take advantage and the championship race be reignited.Guardiola’s penchant for a midfielder may have broadened to full-backs given he signed two when a centre-back was needed. Of these João Cancelo has looked shaky and though able to operate along both flanks has made only four league starts. Angeliño, re-signed from PSV Eindhoven, was in the starting XI at Turf Moor but lacks the verve of Benjamin Mendy. Rodri is City’s best close-season acquisition: the Spaniard’s elegant style masks a formidable physical presence that makes him a silkier yet still robust long-term replacement for Fernandinho as City’s holding player.Of Daniel James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire the central defender has not matched his billing as the expected dead-cert successful acquisition. Maguire can be sloppy in possession, sluggish in anticipation and one-paced. James, though, has taken to Premier League football instantly and wears the United shirt – which can be “heavy” – with aplomb, adding pace and sparkle to the frontline. Wan-Bissaka also looks a natural and his “Spider” moniker is apt: not many attackers get the better him at right-back.Solskjær believes a top-four place can be achieved but if so his side will have to put a run of wins together – which they have not done since January. United strolled through the Europa League group stage so maybe this or the Carabao andor FA Cup can be won. In short, fifth place plus a trophy is progress (not real success), top four and no cups would be success.If City cannot retain the title and fail to seriously challenge then reaching the Champions League final is the bare minimum. Guardiola publicly maintains that his team are not ready to be European kings but this is surely a ploy to ease pressure on players given that he has had three seasons and counting to construct an XI of requisite quality. City’s best run under him has been to the quarter-finals, which is a disappointment, so should they retain one or both of the domestic cups but fail to reach the final of the continent’s premier club competition 2019-20 will still rate as a failure.The effervescent Raheem Sterling, peerless Kevin De Bruyne and evergreen Sergio Agüero lead the City roll call closely followed by Riyad Mahrez, Rodri, David Silva, and Ederson. Honourable mentions can also be given to Bernardo Silva, Kyle Walker and Gabriel Jesus. This collective illustrate that while City may be third they still remain Liverpool’s greatest threat. Beyond James and Wan-Bissaka for United, Marcus Rashford has nine league goals and was virtually unplayable against Spurs, Scott McTominay is becoming a genuine United midfielder and Victor Lindelöf is reliable at centre-back. Inconsistency is found in Anthony Martial (three league goals), Fred (good against Spurs) and Andreas Pereira (can be promising), while Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and the remainder of the squad – apart from the goalkeeper, David de Gea – all have to start returning eight-out-of-10 displays rather than their usual less than five."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a52b703363fec7acadd2b9faab129fe5760ea31/533_125_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209dc678854ca77d7223fcba6fb1e335","title":"the fiver middlesbrough v charlton woodgate v bowyer","story":"Sign up now!

Or Woodgate v Bowyer, if you’re wondering why The Fiver is bothering to get the weekend started by previewing 20th v 17th in the Championship instead of the Manchester derby. You see, the former Nasty Leeds players have a history and back when The Fiver was listening to the Strokes and pretending we had a future, we’d have bet all our Tin money on the former nightspot-bothering teammates not making it into management.But here they are, 20 years later, seemingly very different people to the ones who avoided jail after a brutal attack at a night out in Leeds. And it is now refreshing to see them dishing out comforting words of wisdom and guidance to the young players who now look up to them.Of course, we’re only talking about football’s ability to rehabilitate and shape the lives of those involved in it. Any Boro fans who have watched Woodgate’s side play would argue that there is nothing positive for them to take out of his move into management. Some would argue he has successfully stopped football altogether. Back when Woodgate was throwing shapes on his Madrid debut, we could only imagine a team under his tutelage playing as though Hunter S Thompson was managing them. Sadly, Boro have just been meh. With one win in 12 and his team scared stiff of entering the opposition half, defeat could lead Steve Gibson to hoof Boro’s returning son out of the door marked Do One. The spectre of an out-of-work Neil Warnock has been looming too. “It’s speculation, I’m not bothered at all. I’ve spoken to the owner, he’s really behind me,” honked Woodgate, forgetting an owner’s job is to have an axe in hand when things are going badly.The final countdown to No 1 on our 2019 list of the best female players in the world.

I arrived here and we were in touch about working together and the time we have spent together has been magnificent. I tried to help him and he has helped me a lot. He knows what I want and what the club wants.”The Manchester City manager said the club have not received any approaches for Arteta’s services. Of potentially replacing him at City in the long-term, Guardiola added: “He is able to do that, but it depends on him, the club – many things that I cannot decide.”Cheers Gregg, and hello again. Who wants to ruin football? Florentino Pérez, so says the Uefa president. This just in from the Associated Press:Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin criticised Real Madrid’s president for reportedly planning a “selfish and egotistical scheme” to create world leagues, saying it would ruin soccer. Financial Times report, Pérez has approached financiers about backing the creation of two world leagues, each with 20 teams. It would rival Fifa’s planned expansion of the Club World Cup from an annual seven-team competition to a 24-team event held every four years from 2021. While Fifa declined to say if its leadership had discussed the plan with Pérez, European soccer’s governing body expressed public displeasure.“I have read about this insane plan,” Ceferin said in a statement. “If reports are to be believed, it comes from a single club president (not the owner) and a lone football administrator. It would be hard to think of a more selfish and egotistical scheme. It would clearly ruin football around the world for the players, for the fans and for everyone connected with the game all for the benefit of a tiny number of people.”It’s a no from Ceferin, then. Stuart Goodwin is going to guide you through the afternoon’s news now. While he jumps into the seat, read our story on the possible return of Nigel Pearson to the Premier League. Have a good weekend. Bye.It’s a sorry state of affairs at Moss Rose, where Macclesfield’s game against Crewe on Saturday has been “suspended” after Town informed the EFL they would be unable to fulfil the fixture. The announcement had been anticipated after Macclesfield’s players released a statement saying they would refuse to play the League Two match due to non-payment of wages.The EFL has just released a statement that reads:Macclesfield Town has informed the EFL that they will not be in a position to fulfil Saturday’s League Two fixture against Crewe Alexandra. As a result of this formal notification, the League has been forced to suspend the game and under EFL Regulations, the club is now deemed to be guilty of misconduct and will be referred to an Independent Disciplinary Commission. The EFL will now consider the matter of determining when the fixture will be played.Earlier this week the club’s former manager Sol Campbell revealed that he was owed money by the club and backed the winding-up petition. Zinedine Zidane has confirmed that Gareth Bale will miss the next two games for Real Madrid (Eyol and Club Brugge) as he continues his recovery from injury. Bale was able to do some light training, though, and by the looks of it he was fit enough to troll Spanish media with some golf swings. Aston Villa manager Dean Smith reckons Jack Grealish loves being kicked. The midfielder is the most fouled player in the Premier League, on average, getting hoofed up in the air almost five times a game ahead of Sunday’s visit of Leicester.It’ll frustrate him if they continually do it and not get cautioned but he takes pleasure in the fact they want to kick him. He gets up and gets on with it.Thanks Stuart. So, what do we make of the Nigel Pearson news, then?The Premier League’s bottom club are in discussions with Nigel Pearson over their managerial vacancy.

After the United game yesterday was a day of complete recovery, today was the second recovery day … so the conditions to work on the pitch are not the best. So less work, more analyse, more meetings, more talk. I’m not a meetings coach – I am a pitch coach, that’s where I really like to coach. That’s the way you can really accelerate all the process.He added, with his side already through in the Champions League, that he plans to rest several players against Bayern Munich on Wednesday.José Mourinho was back in the purple puffa-puffa for the assembled press at Spurs. His side host Burnley tomorrow …We are conceding too much and we are conceding some, what I used to call ‘cheap goals’ – we have to try and stop it. The best way to do it is to work. Chelsea visit Big Dunc’s Everton in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. Frank Lampard has been smiling heartily at the prospect of signing players older than 11 or 12, thanks to 11.03’s news re: the club’s transfer ban being halved … Obviously the club was working towards that and it’s a positive outcome for us. Now there’s the potential to look at the market going forward, so I’m pleased. I’m happy with the squad we have here, we’re doing OK.”Remember kids, swig your Vimto every time a football club links up with a brand you’ve never heard of. Youku and Tmall are certainly new ones on me. This from Reuters, for those who buzz off this kind of thing …Premier League club Manchester United have agreed a partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba in an effort to extend the club’s engagement with fans in China. The deal will see Alibaba provide club content on its online video platform Youku and develop a future club store on the company’s business-to-consumer platform Tmall.While existing Premier League broadcast deals restrict United from broadcasting live league matches on Youku, a leading online video service in China, United will have a dedicated club channel on the platform which will show a range of content.Full story on Brendan Rodgers’s new contract now live …New on the site: Louise Taylor on Leeds’ hopes of getting back up to the Premier League. They visit Huddersfield in tomorrow’s West Yorkshire derby. What do Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Don Revie’s famously formidable Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s have in common? The answer, potentially a fiendish pub quiz contender, is that all three have been recipients of the freedom of the city, with surviving members of Revie’s squad receiving this rare civic honour as recently as Wednesday … Read it here …West Ham host Arsenal in the Monday night Premier League game. Manuel Pellegrini, whose side won at Chelsea and lost at Wolves in their last two matches, has been talking, with his side in 15th, two points above the relegation places …I said before those two games if we drew both of them it would be a good result. I worry more about the points we lost at home against Newcastle, Palace and Sheffield United – games that we deserved to win. With four or five points more we’d be in eighth position in the table at this moment. That has passed and now we must try to be focused on the next game.Leicester City chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha added lots of things about qualities, philosophies and visions:Brendan’s qualities as a coach are well-known and evident in the way he has sought to unlock the potential in every member of our exciting young squad.But just as important to us is the suitability of Brendan’s wider philosophy to the club’s established culture and values. He and his staff immersed themselves immediately, building an understanding for the club and the city and an appreciation for what makes them special.That has been a valuable combination over the last nine months – strengthening the bond between our players, staff and supporters – and I’m excited to see how it can continue to enhance our long-term vision for the club.”THIS JUST IN, which may be of interest to Arsenal fans – one manager linked to their vacancy has signed a new five-and-a-half year deal at Leicester … Leicester City are delighted to announce that Brendan Rodgers has committed to a new contract with the Club to June 2025.Brendan Rodgers said: “When I made the decision to come to Leicester City, it was because I was excited about the direction the club was taking and how I could apply my experience to the journey. I came here with a purpose to add something to that and to help the club build for the future.“The support I have had from the chairman, Khun Top from the chief executive, Susan Whelan from the director of football, Jon Rudkin and from everyone at the club has been amazing. I’ve inherited an outstanding team of staff that are dedicated to progress and improvement and we have a group of players that are a joy to work with every day.“And to the club’s supporters, I can only say thank you for welcoming me and my staff into your club and for putting your faith in our work. We’ll continue to work together to bring success to Leicester City for many years to come.”Jamie Jackson assesses the fortunes (or otherwise) of both sides before tomorrow’s Manchester derby …Chris Wilder has also been saying his piece on “consistently inconsistent” VAR, after his Sheffield United side’s defeat was sealed by Jonjo Shelvey’s breakaway goal for Newcastle last night. The Blades’ defence stopped after assistant referee Derek Eaton raised his flag, assuming an offside was about to be given against Andy Carroll, who had flicked the ball on. Play continued and replays showed that Carroll was fractionally onside. Wilder said …He’s an unbelievably good actor is Jonjo, if he’s telling me he knew … he strolled up to that ball and thought: ‘I’ll take a little bit of a chance and just roll it in, and see what happens. That’s what he did. Don’t kid yourself that he’s through and he knew he was going to be in.Daniel Farke has been a-chattin’, before Norwich host Sheffield United on Sunday. The two promoted sides have had differing fortunes this season, with the Blades in ninth while Norwich are second-bottom after Wednesday’s 2-1 defeat to Southampton.We are still a newly-promoted side who have not spent any money, so in each and every second at this level we must be at our best. We now have a home game and if we carry on in the way we finished this game then we have every chance of a win. It is not like Southampton played us out of the park, we were just bullied.”Benjamin McIntyre mails with thoughts on Chelsea’s new-found transfer freedom:“I think Chelsea will be aware that they shouldn’t rush out and sign anyone just because they can,” he says. “The midfield is stacked with talent, with Loftus-Cheek still to come back, and the youngsters leading the line are ripping it up. I don’t see why Lampard would want to tinker with that. “The only eventual targets they might have are at left-back as neither Alonso or Emerson have been performing consistency or a back-up striker as Chelsea are much less potent when Abraham can’t lead the line. “I’d be very surprised to see those ZahaDembélé rumours get any real traction.”In his first league start since January, Xherdan Shaqiri put in a superb performance against Everton, including a goal, and seemingly while wearing Philippe Coutinho’s hair. More from Klopp … Shaq was injured twice with the same injury and it took time. The team was winning pretty much all the games, which was difficult. When you come on the pitch I expect the desire to show you are good enough. They all did that, Shaq did that especially. He was in a really good mood and really good shape and that’s the situation where you can deliver a really good performance.Two of his side’s standout performers on Wednesday were Sadio Mané and Divock Origi. Sadio’s incredible. Since his first days he was an incredibly important player for us. I can still remember his first goal for us. He made big steps each year. Sadio, especially in the game against Barcelona here at home … it was like there were three of him. I’m really happy for him.He needs to be in a confident mood and then everybody knows what he’s able to do. The first was a brilliant pass from Sadio but the second was just a world-class goal.Afternoon all, bon appetit Gregg. And no sooner do I arrive, than Big Jürg’s up, talking before Liverpool play Bournemouth tomorrow …On Marco Silva, whose time at Goodison Park ended after Everton were on the receiving end of a 5-2 shoeing …There are a lot of people who worry still and a lot of people who hope you fail. We know we are in a really, really difficult situation with the games coming up. We have to deal with it … we need to be lucky with the players, that they can stay fit and healthy. What that means for Christmas I never thought about.You need a smart squad, people with half a brain at least. It’s not Fifa or PlayStation where they don’t need a rest.”Right, I’m going to hand over to Stuart Goodwin for a bit. He’ll guide you through the lunchtime press conferences. I may be back a little later on. Bye for now. Watford’s caretaker manager Hayden Mullins wants to be a Bez-like vibes man while he is in charge. The Hornets played well in defeat at Leicester and they host his former club, Crystal Palace, tomorrow. Mullins wants there to be a feelgood atmosphere at Vicarage Road when Roy Hodgson’s high-flyers visit. Palace are a side in form, but we are going to try to start with a high temp. We know we need to start fast. If we give the fans something to cheer about then they will be with us and we need them. We know it is a game we need to attack and get the fans going and loud with the team. We have to try to get positivity throughout the whole stadium.Sam Allardyce, Chris Hughton, Paul Clement and Quique Setien have all been linked with the vacant job but there has also been talk of Mullins being given the role until the end of the season if he impresses as a coach. He’s currently the Under-23s manager and a positive result against Palace would strengthen his case for sticking around for a while longer. “The halving of the transfer ban is the worst possible outcome for Chelsea and Frank Lampard should now be very afraid,” writes Karl Gibbons. “Names like Zaha and Dembele should strike fear into not just Hudson-Odoi and Mount but all Chelsea fans. Going out and splashing the cash now will be a step backwards and I hope that the club’s hierarchy realise this and approach with caution. Certainly, buy players but do not forget the joy that has arisen this season in seeing the club’s ‘youngsters’ and perpetual loanees finally being given the room and opportunity to shine, and shine they have!”As I type Ole Gunnar Solskjær is managing Manchester United, Duncan Ferguson is manager of Everton and Frederick Ljungberg is Arsenal’s boss. What’s the perfect late-90s song to soundtrack that managerial trio? Chasing Rainbows? Who will Chelsea target in the transfer window? Two players are mentioned in today’s edition of the Rumour Mill: Wilfried Zaha and Ousmane Dembélé. Ben Chilwell has been mentioned as a potential option, too. There’s a huge match in the Bundesliga tomorrow, where league leaders Mönchengladbach host Bayern, who are languishing in fourth, a place above Dortmund. It’s a big match anyway but for Bayern’s interim manager Hans-Dieter Flick it’s a family affair, too: Since my childhood Gladbach against Bayern was always a classic. In the house of Flick it was a classic as well, my brother was a Gladbach fan and I’m a Bayern fan. We’re on the right track and we will travel there with confidence. We showed good things against Leverkusen despite the defeat. We created many chances. Off the ball, some things were not good but we worked on them in training this week.The top of the Bundesliga table makes for interesting viewing: Here’s our story on Chelsea’s transfer ban being lifted in January: Breaking news! Chelsea can buy players in the January transfer window after the court of arbitration for sport announced that the two-window transfer ban has been halved. Here’s an extract from Cas’s statement. “The sole arbitrator found that CFC did violate Articles 19.1 (related to the international transfer of minors) and 19.3 (related to the first registration of minors), but for a significantly smaller number of players (about one third of the violations found by Fifa). In addition, the violations of other RSTP rules were found to be less serious than those attributed to Chelsea FC by FIFA. Accordingly, the Sole Arbitrator reduced the sanction to one single transfer ban (which Chelsea FC already served during the 2019 summer registration period), and halved the monetary sanction.Ole Gunnar Solskjær couldn’t help himself from opening a can of b@ntz and showering Manchester City with it when he was asked for his thoughts on the Manchester derby. Here’s Jamie Jackson’s hot take on the press conference: A view on Everton target Vitor Pereira from below the line. It’s a slightly baffled one: Vitor Pereira for Marco Silva? I cannot believe what I\u0027m seeing here.Pereira was once promising - around a decade ago when he replaced the Chelsea-bound AVB. But since then he was so-so at Porto, awful at Olympiacos (I know he won the title there but his unsportsmanlike behaviour made even Olympiacos fans enemies of him), mediocre at Fenerbahce (in-fighting with Robin van Persie and Kjaer did not help) and woeful at 1860 Munchen.He has been in China for the better part of the last two years and although he pipped the giants Guangzhou to the title in 2018, he is not much loved there either as he has had two bang average AFC Champions League campaigns. The rumours that he is earning close to £15 million a year there also make this move more baffling than it already is!Amazon has been heartily slapping itself on the back after declaring its first foray into broadcasting Premier League matches a success. “We’re delighted that millions of football fans enjoyed watching Amazon’s first ever round of Premier League matches on Prime Video,” said Alex Green, managing director of Prime Video Sport Europe. “We are excited to be the first ever broadcaster to bring fans all 10 games live in a fixture round. We are thrilled and humbled by the positive response from Prime members not only to the production and streaming experience, but also the innovations we have introduced, such as integrated live match stats and highlights through X-Ray plus the ability to experience commentary-free stadium atmosphere.”The coverage was fine but, personally, I find streaming a horrible way to watch football, which should be communal. Having to watch on a delay on your laptop isn’t ideal, is it? Everyone knows a goal’s been scored before you actually get to view it. Pubs that had Sky Sports on one TV and Amazon through their box on the other were effectively screening live spoilers. What next for Marco Silva, then? As ever, Barney Ronay gets to the essence of his subject in this brilliant piece:Aged 42 Silva is pretty much done in England, destined for China or Qatar, a one-man mystery story for future football historians. He does, though, still have a very good coat.There’s some more from Eddie Howe here. He dismissed links with the Everton job and said his focus is on improving his Bournemouth team, who have dropped to 14th in the league after a sorry run of four straight defeats. Here’s what he had to say about the Liverpool match: I’m invigorated and energised to get results here. I have no problems with my energy levels, my enthusiasm, anything. This is a tough, tough league and we’re in a tough moment. But these challenges are what inspires me. There’s no bigger challenge than when I first took the job here in my first ever managerial appointment and we found a way out of a situation so we can find our way out of anything. We all need to collectively come together and show that unity and fight and challenge and that’s what I’m asking my players to do.A big blow for Howe tomorrow is that Harry Wilson is not available due to the loan agreement with Liverpool. He’s scored six goals from midfield for the Cherries this season. Howe has defensive problems too. He’ll be without Steve Cook (broken wrist) and Adam Smith (ankle) while the centre-forward Josh King (hamstring) is also missing.Duncan Ferguson is taking Everton training this morning and he’s being assisted by John Ebbrell, Franny Jeffers and Alan Kelly. It’s so very old school. I wonder if he’s coaching this kind of approach to stopping Chelsea?On the Manchester derby itself, Solskjær is hoping to have Anthony Martial fit and available but Paul Pogba is still out with an ankle injury. Martial was a doubt to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium after picking up a knock last weekend against Aston Villa that for Solskjaer expected to see him out “for a little while”. But the France forward looks set to return.“We hope to have Anthony definitely for part of the game - I’m not sure if he’s able to start,” Solskjær said. “Paul probably won’t be, no.” Asked when he is expecting Pogba back, he said: “As soon as possible, as quickly as possible. He’s out on the grass training. I said in 2019 so hopefully we’ll see him before the New Year definitely.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær has arrived at Carrington to preview the Manchester derby but he has taken little time in laying into the Corriere dello Sport “Black Friday” headline, which featured images of Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku alongside it. The paper has defended the headline despite widespread condemnation and accusations of racism but Solskjær has a withering view of the Italian paper’s editorial judgment. He has offered his support to his former player Lukaku and Smalling, who is on loan at Roma from Manchester United. Right, so who is going to inherit the sorry mess atHe’s referring to a run of four defeats in a row in the Premier League – and they face Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium at 3pm tomorrow. Yikes!Do you want to know who the ’s best female footballer of 2019 is? Have a look at our complete top 100 list, then. It will certainly please Chelsea fans. It’s that time of year when football just doesn’t stop. With the fading boos at Arsenal signalling that the midweek Premier League matches having only just finished we’re already on to previewing this weekend’s fixtures, the pick of which is Saturday evening’s Manchester derby. Duncan Ferguson’s temporary managerial bow when Everton take on Chelsea in Saturday’s early kick-off will be worth keeping an eye on, too, mind. Given his hands-on approach to dealing with troubling situations in the past, there will certainly be a reaction from his Toffees after their midweek Merseyside derby mauling. He’s also going to have to speak to journalists today. That could be a lot of fun.Here is the list of Premier League fixtures: Take a look at the latest Premier League table here and if you’re wondering what you should be looking out for this weekend, this might help:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49da00b80fcca9bfe223333d87637acdb5ac7935/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfda334be1bf25f5ae6a6287dd6c5d1d","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2019","story":"Sam Kerr has narrowly beaten Lucy Bronze to finish top of our ranking of the best players in the world this year.

Then oil companies arrived and wrought an environmental catastrophe• All photographs by Arteh Odjidja, whose work features in the exhibition Rise for Bayelsa, which runs in London until 20 December 2019 Almost every day, Udengs Eradiri is informed of another oil spill in Bayelsa state, in the Niger Delta. Most of the time, little or nothing is done to clean up the mess, says Eradiri, the state’s commissioner for the environment.Today, he added, you can spend the whole day without catching anything.Oil was first pumped in Bayelsa in 1956 by Shell. Since then, several international oil companies have extracted oil from across the Niger Delta.In Bayelsa and elsewhere, communities have faced an environmental catastrophe. About 40 million litres of oil are spilled every year across the Niger Delta, according to the Rise for Bayelsa campaign.Air, land and water have all been contaminated, with studies reporting devastating effects on residents’ health and livelihoods. Vast areas of the state’s waterways and mangrove swamps – one of the most erse ecosystems in Africa – have been destroyed or put at risk. Farmland has been cloaked in oil, contaminating crops and exposing people to high levels of heavy metals such as chromium, lead and mercury.Meanwhile, gas flares – where natural gas associated with petroleum extraction is burned off in the atmosphere – have filled the air with pollutants, and created acid rain.“It’s really telling on the people,” says Eradiri. Of Bayelsa’s estimated population of 2 million people, three-quarters rely on fishing or farming to support themselves. “Those communities are getting involved in other ways of surviving. And that’s why there’s been a lot of upsurge in criminal activities as well as artisan refining, all to survive.”Shell, one of the international oil companies operating in Bayelsa, says that oil spills due to crude oil theft, illegal refining and sabotage cause the most environmental damage in the Niger Delta.“Our aim is to run a responsible business, which means operating safely without harm to people and protecting the local environment. In Nigeria, we operate to the same standards as other Shell-operated ventures globally. No spill is acceptable, and we work hard to prevent them,” Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said in a statement.“We work closely with the regulators, local communities and other stakeholders to address this challenging issue and, irrespective of cause, we clean up and remediate areas affected by spills from our facilities or pipeline network,” the statement added.It said that in the case of operational spills, compensation is paid to people and communities impacted.The company says its efforts to clean up areas have at times been hampered by instability, as its employees are unable to safely access affected areas.“If you want to resolve the issues in the Niger Delta, if you want to totally eradicate the compromise on infrastructure, you must involve communities in the contractual agreement,” says Eradiri. “That means it is not just owned by other people with other interests.”A recent study estimated that, in 2012 alone, 16,000 babies died within the first month of life because of oil pollution in the Niger Delta.Separate research, cited by the interim report of the Bayelsa State Oil and Environmental Commission, has found that pollution is placing communities at heightened risk of kidney damage, as well as diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Campaigners report increased cases of diarrhoea and child malnutrition.The commission’s interim report concluded that communities suffered life-changing health consequences as a result of oil pollution. The report added that they have also found it almost impossible to secure fair redress.The Rise for Bayelsa campaign, launched in March, is calling on international oil companies to clean up spills immediately, provide swift compensation to all communities affected, and develop long-term solutions to avoid spills. The campaign is also calling for oil companies to invest in sustainable projects in all communities in which oil companies operate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ce07d737de8896e8f1134989e162531e0ca06ea/0_372_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6e1e5202c91389e45ed7b09d4cc1e1","title":"tell us about your experiences of finding christmas love","story":"Whether you were actively looking or it happened unexpectedly, we want to hear your stories of meeting your partner at ChristmasChristmas can be a good time of year for romance.Cuffing season runs from 1 December – 15 January and is said to be the time when single people are more likely to want relationships.

This meant that soon after coming home at 2am, merry and hot from booze, I began to dehydrate, dry heat wrinkling my wine-soaked body like an expensive cured sausage, although I didn’t feel so tasty.I have been working on my hangovers for years (tinkering, testing), trying to optimise them. I’ve tried it all – pickle juice, milk thistle – because if I can just remove the nausea and the nagging feeling that my colleagues hate me, hangovers could be wonderful. They are, as friends with children can attest, an immense privilege: lie-ins, fry-ups and binge-watching. Of course, the only true cure is abstinence, but the search has led me to discover “emotional hangovers”.An emotional hangover is the empty, lethargic feeling you have post-BNO, but without drinking. Usually, it follows an intense experience, be it the joy of getting married, or the disappointment of a failed test. Apparently, the brain responds to heightened emotion in a similar way to booze and reels from it in the same way.Perhaps my hangovers haven’t been in vain, because in between festive boozing this year, there’s an election – an extremely stressful and urgent contest, the significance of which exceeds anything I’ve seen. Despite never having had the pleasure of voting in an election where my party wins, I am still unprepared for it to lose.Next week’s result will probably leave me with a hangover of both kinds. And when I think of that morning, the reckoning, I know I won’t have a strategy to deal with it. But I have learned this tip I will share with you: that egg and chips and a bottle of Lucozade isn’t the worst place to start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bcfe17822256bb9102b426e5dfa63f8dbe01dc/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5545a04a4ade85c51d6b59e4889c7f67","title":"worried about the election dont its as futile as rewriting the past","story":"When you fret about the future, you’re demanding reassurance, yet this is something it can never give youThere’s a good chance that you’re worried, right now, about what the future holds. I raise this in the context of next week’s election and Brexit, of course, but that situation’s hardly unique: many of us are always worried about what the future holds, in some domain – and still would be even if politics suddenly started going our way. Which makes this as good a time as any to recall what a strange emotion worry is. No matter how much badness is in store for you, once you’ve taken whatever precautions you can, worry is largely useless. In prehistory, when threats were immediate and physical, a surge of anxiety could motivate evasive action. But that’s not true of most modern worries, whether they’re political, environmental, related to your job, your relationship or your kids instead, the anxiety just hangs around and feeds on itself. Honestly, it might be preferable just to have to outrun a sabre-toothed tiger every few weeks.It’s interesting to consider the asymmetry in our feelings about the future versus the past. Looking ahead, life’s unpredictability maddens us, and we worry because we feel, if subconsciously, that doing so will help bring the future under our control. (Or we act hyper-cautiously, also in hopes of controlling the future: “Dad suggests arriving at airport 14 hours early,” reads an Onion headline, apparently inspired by my childhood.) Yet, looking backwards – and I know I risk sounding like I’ve been consuming substances derived from the leaf of the cannabis plant here – isn’t it odd that we’re untroubled by the zigzagging path of coincidence and unpredictability that brought us to this point?“Sometimes I wake up with a feeling of childish amazement – why am I myself?” wrote Simone de Beauvoir. “What astonishes me… is the fact of finding myself here, and at this moment, deep in this life and not in any other… The penetration of that particular ovum by that particular spermatozoon, with its implications of the meeting of my parents and before that of their birth and the birth of all their forebears, had not one chance in hundreds of millions of coming about.”It’s no mystery that we should care more about the unpredictability of the future the past, after all, is water under the bridge. What’s bizarre about the energy we invest in fretting about the future is that we should imagine we ever could have much control over, or knowledge of it, given how little we had in the past. Countless coincidences and blind historical forces made you who you are today. Wouldn’t it be reasonable to assume they’ll play an overwhelming role in what happens next? And doesn’t that drive home the fact that worrying about it can’t possibly be productive?I don’t mean to imply you can reason yourself out of worry entirely. But there’s some liberation in realising the truth: when you worry, you’re demanding reassurance, yet this is something you’ll definitely never get from the future, for the simple reason that it hasn’t occurred yet.

The Aberdeen UK Property Fund was the second-worst performer and suffered about £773m in cash withdrawals.However, M\u0026ampG’s problem could end up snowballing if the suspension ends up spooking other investors into pulling money from other property funds, Fitch warned. “The suspension of redemptions in the M\u0026ampG Property Portfolio could precipitate outflows from other commercial real estate funds as investors seek to redeem holdings before other funds potentially implement extraordinary liquidity control mechanisms.”Asset managers can try to avoid gating their funds by introducing new measures such as queues, which would allow customers to make redemptions in a more orderly way, but that kind of structural change has not been widely adopted.“Without such measures, more UK commercial real estate funds may have to impose extraordinary liquidity measures, particularly given the backdrop of the Brexit process and the negative outlook for the commercial real estate sector,” Fitch said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1aed3f064f2bc15315891541a58d53656f5634c/1030_618_2646_1588/master/2646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd90a7108cbf8be4fbc05d49383ce36a","title":"krept and konan review","story":"O2 Arena, LondonThis UK duo prove the best revenge is living well in a flawless gig that begins with a flash and ends with heart and soul‘I feel like everything has led up to this moment.” These are the solemn words of UK rapper Krept (real name: Casyo Johnson) in a short film titled The Road to the O2, which documents him and musical partner Konan (Karl Wilson) on their journey from being independent artists to headlining the 20,000-strong venue. But does that sense of occasion translate to the show itself? Within two minutes of it beginning – with a 3D re-creation of the old-fashioned sweetshop on their album cover, a sprinkling of pyrotechnics, a choreographed fleet of hooded figures pretending to be Krept and Konan, and the appearance of four giant inflatable goats – the answer is a resounding yes.This is not to say that Krept and Konan rely on gimmicks. After the flashy showmanship of their intro, all they need to unite the room is the bolshy, instantly recognisable force of their six-year-old hit Don’t Waste My Time. Leaders in UK rap for a decade (their aforementioned documentary includes footage of their first-ever gig, opening for Skepta in 2011), the two have an easy chemistry that’s magnetic to watch: they slide effortlessly from hip-hop singles to grime freestyles to dancehall-inflected album cuts.Though they’ve been around for a decade, 2019’s Revenge Is Sweet is only the pair’s second album (following countless mixtapes, remixes and freestyles). The revenge of the title is aimed at the establishment media and music industry that have rarely taken them seriously. But while it flirts with sinister imagery, the record is a celebratory reminder that the best revenge is living well. That sense of celebration makes the pair’s appearance at the O2 so unforgettable. This is a joyful victory lap that’s shared with the crowd, whether Krept and Konan are floating across the stadium on a moving platform, leading an Afrobeats versus bashment dance battle, or encouraging the crowd to yell “wanker” at a video of a Boris Johnson lookalike before performing their song Liar Liar.What makes Revenge Is Sweet feel especially significant is that, having featured many high-profile American artists (Jeremih, Rick Ross) on their 2015 debut, Krept and Konan worked with a fleet of their British peers on the follow-up, instilling the record with a vehement sense of pride and community. That spirit powers the best portions of the live show, as a big red button and some Street Fighter-inspired visuals are used to ceremoniously announce each of their special guests, which include Stefflon Don, king of hooks MoStack and grime stalwart Stormzy. They also pay their moment forwards, making room for new faces, as afro-bashment group NSG come out to perform their viral summer hit OT Bop.But the show’s most poignant moments come at its close, with an uplifting tribute to rapper Cadet, who was killed by a dangerous driver in 2018, and a performance of Broski. The most heartbreaking song on Revenge, it was dedicated to their friend and business partner Nash Chagonda, who killed himself last year. Krept’s voice crumbles as he raps: “Now my heart’s broken that we have to go without him.” It’s one of many moments balances Krept and Konan’s hilarious and show-stealing production with genuine heart and soul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd9278c8ad6945da133f7880a8cb73b4b8323c5/0_340_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a96acd68cd4d9f1d91ceb89371f79e","title":"liam payne lp1 review capitol","story":"(Capitol)One Direction’s Mr Boring lets his inner sexual piranha loose – with frightening resultsLiam Payne recently lamented that when One Direction’s management realised he was the sensible one, they made him keep his bandmates in check. Getting cast as Mr Boring was annoying, he explained, yielding him the least screams from fans. Happily for Payne, solo freedom has let him reap maximum screams and embrace his officiousness: with 3.7bn streams, he is the most commercially popular 1D member.It’s hard to see why. Despite LP1’s effortful attempts to cast Payne as a sexual piranha, the 26-year-old generally comes off as an uptight scold. On Hips Don’t Lie, he stares at a woman’s groin as she dances and warns that she’d better not be wasting his time. “I hope your hips don’t lie unless they’re lying with me,” he sings, a conclusion so deathly it feels like a funeral for reproduction. The thrumming Rude Hours finds him inviting a lady to a “parking lot”. “Might be a bad idea,” he admits, “I’ll probably do your ass in the car.” But never let it be said that Payne is boring and responsible: “Key unlocks the door, ticket on the floor.” If it’s a pay and display, there’ll be murder if it’s not clearly visible. Stack It Up is halfway between a 2003 50 Cent single and the Tory manifesto: “If you wanna stack it up,” he advises, “you gotta work for it.”Such are the accidental highs of an album empty of intentional humour, heart, or anything much human at all beyond base carnality. Its generic trap and Latin-tinged production and its many guest rappers suggest Payne is trying to keep pace with Drake and the Weeknd. He can’t, because his rank randiness lacks the sense of guilty pleasure that makes his Canadian contemporaries irresistible. The simmering Both Ways, about a woman who loves threesomes, finds him and her “sharing that body like it’s our last meal”, like cheetahs at a carcass. On Familiar, he admires a lady who’s “shaped like a model or some kind of bottle” – Orangina? Ketchup? Perhaps this leg-crossing horror show is another sign of Payne’s prudence: LP1 is a terrible pop album, but very effective contraception."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

It’s already dark on a recent Wednesday afternoon when director Jorge Munoz swings open the makeshift doors for the few dozen kids who have been waiting in the gravel parking lot facing the Union Pacific railroad tracks in the rear.It’s been six months since Andy Ruiz Jr, the ramshackle gym’s most famous alumnus, became the first fighter of Mexican descent to win the world heavyweight championship in one of the biggest shocks in boxing history, stopping the undefeated Anthony Joshua in seven rounds at Madison Square Garden. If the agate-type outcome came as a surprise, the optics of the upset beggared belief. The doughy Ruiz, even at a svelte-for-him 268lb, hardly looked the part of a world-class athlete, and never less so than next to Joshua, the chiseled 6ft 6in, 247lb champion whose advantages in height (four inches) and reach (eight inches) portended a slaughter.And a one-way affair it was, only not in the direction most expected. The unheralded Ruiz, a replacement opponent dialled in on five weeks’ notice who went off as an 11-1 underdog, battered perhaps the sport’s biggest global star with blinding flurries of punches. Joshua was knocked down four times before the fight was stopped on a night that turned the sport’s prestige ision on its ear.The 30-year-old son of Mexican-born parents has since emerged as the everyman icon of a region located about 15 miles north of the Mexican border that’s often found in the crosshairs of the national debate over immigration. There was a trip around the late-night TV circuit. A parade down the main drag of his hometown of Imperial. A visit with Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. And a $10m guarantee for Saturday’s rematch in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.Tonight, as on most nights lately, the semi-open-air gym is busy with youngsters. Intensely focused novices as young as six practice their footwork, throwing punches as they walk along strips of duct tape. Others thud away at the heavy bags hanging in the larger room next door, where a newly painted mural depicts Ruiz towering over the conquered Joshua.The flurry of activity is a welcome sight for Munoz, a former boxer who helped open Sparta nearly a decade ago to give back to the Imperial Valley community. Membership nearly tripled after Ruiz’s victory, growing from 20 members to about 60 today. The monthly dues are $30, but Munoz doesn’t charge the many who can’t afford to pay. To make the $1,000 rent, the gym holds monthly pollo al disco fundraisers where people from across the valley come and get their plates.The border-straddling origins of boxing’s unlikely heavyweight champion were planted when Ruiz’s father emigrated from Mexicali at eight years old. Andy Ruiz Sr was 20 when he married and put down roots in nearby Imperial, where he started a successful business – purchasing lots, building houses and selling them – that he still oversees today.The elder Ruiz, whose father owned a boxing gym in Mexico, steered his middle son toward the sport when he was five to channel a hyperactive streak that was getting him into trouble at school. Almost immediately he recognized the potential of his son’s size and speed. Ruiz won his first official fight aged seven in San Diego, though he was sent home from Ben Hulse Elementary School for countless other extracurricular bouts in between repeat viewings of the Rocky movies.“I used to tell him you’re going to be the Mexican Rocky,” Ruiz Sr says. “Dreams do come true.”Ruiz was already 180lbs at nine years old, which led his father to put him in with older kids who wouldn’t be overwhelmed by his size and speed. The pair made endless trips back and forth over the Calexico border crossing to train at gyms in Mexicali, where he sparred with professionals often twice his age and became accustomed to problem-solving against opponents far larger than him.There he caught the attention of Cuban trainer Fernando Ferrer, who took him on as a pupil and introduced the skill and technique to complement the teenager’s innate power and toughness. Even then, Ruiz Sr recalls, his son was underestimated due to his chubby physique, which belied his hand speed and ring intelligence. His career took off from there as he won all but five of his 110 amateur fights on both sides of the border, capturing a handful of national titles after leaving school at 16 to focus on boxing full-time.“I always put in Andy’s mind that he’s a Mexican and an American, that we represent both countries,” Ruiz Sr says.He signed a professional contract with leading promoter Top Rank and spent three years working with famed trainer Freddie Roach at the Wild Card Boxing Club in Hollywood, living in a cramped one-bedroom apartment where his father slept on the couch. But even as he continued winning fights, Ruiz’s career failed to progress and self-doubt festered.“He was depressed because he had 31 or 32 fights and he was making $25,000,” Ruiz Sr recalls. “A lot of those heavyweights were making $250,000. He didn’t have enough money to support his sons.”After six years, the mounting frustration with Top Rank’s lack of investment in Ruiz’s career prompted Ruiz Sr to buy out his son’s contract for $200,000. After a realignment with powerful advisor Al Haymon and a fifth-round knockout of Alexander Dimitrenko in April, Ruiz lobbied Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, for a shot at the title after the champion’s original opponent, Jarrell Miller, failed a series of dope tests.“We know their struggles,” says Munoz, who helped oversee Ruiz’s early training at the Sparta gym while accompanying him to countless amateur tournaments. “We know how many times they wanted to give up. And the people in the boxing world, they understand how much you go to tournaments and you sacrifice, sometimes you don’t have food, you come back and you try to raise the money to go somewhere else and all these struggles you go through with one goal that you might never get the chance for.“That’s what everybody relates to. They understand that struggle. It wasn’t given to them.”Ruiz’s improbable rise mirrors the rebound of Imperial, a dusty agricultural community framed by the mountain ranges, flat deserts and sprawling lettuce, sugar beet and onion fields of southeastern California. In 1979 an earthquake destroyed most of the downtown business district, and the rebuild was slow until recent years. According to the US Census Bureau, Imperial has swelled in population from about 8,000 in 2000 to nearly 20,000 today, making it one of California’s fastest growing cities – a growth that has been driven by an increase in government jobs, expanded housing and the allure of a good school district. Now in Ruiz, one of the city’s own has made an international mark.“It does put the city of Imperial on a worldwide map, that he came from a small community with meager beginnings in life, and has risen all the way to the extreme top in his field of sports,” says county supervisor Mike Kelley. “It is a feather in the cap for the community. It might not result in a windfall of economic growth here, but it’s had a windfall of pride within Imperial County.”Kelley, who awarded Ruiz the city’s order of merit at a June parade in the champion’s honor and lives in a house that Ruiz Sr helped him build, describes Imperial as a close-knit place where everybody knows each other. While national headlines tend to only focus on the region in the context of Donald Trump’s much-hyped wall, on the ground the border exists only as a vague idea in a community where locals routinely travel between countries to work, shop, visit family and receive medical care.“People are aware of the political issues that are going on,” Kelley says. “It’s discussed, but there’s no one out parading and picketing. We live right next door to Mexico.”Ruiz Sr believes the family’s story can offer an important counterpoint to the fiery rhetoric over immigration coming from the White House, saying they’d gladly accept an invitation from the president if it’s ever extended.“Our family is stable here, but we want to help the immigrants,” Ruiz Sr says. “We want to make people informed that immigrants come to work, they don’t come to steal. The president of the United States should let our people work, because that’s what they want to come and do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd33ceae1ec83e5c1df8745c1b7f639bfa268353/7_0_1812_1088/master/1812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e9e6380cafeaf71094792db1bb4f7a1","title":"ctrl alt deliver why silicon valley must go out with a bang","story":"After six seasons, Mike Judge’s tech comedy is almost at an end – but it’s less ‘well oiled machine’, more ‘system error’. It’s time to give it the ending it deservesSilicon Valley ends this week. It ends for good. And more than any other show in recent memory, Mike Judge’s startup sitcom needs to deliver. After nearly six years on the air, this final season has been so hit and miss that it’s bound to be defined by its finale. End it well, and the show will go down as one of the smartest comedies of the decade. But one wrong move could throw its failings into sharp relief, and it will go out as a middling, quickly forgotten sitcom.I have to say, I expected a lot more from this season. The end has been coming for a while, and the creators have had plenty of time to build a muscular climax. That is what shows are supposed to do. Breaking Bad gave Walter White a machine gun and figured out what he should do with it. The first scene of the final run of Mad Men contained the “om” that would conclude the final episode. When a show has the finish line in sight, it has a chance to define what it is. It is an opportunity to say something big about itself, about us.But so far, that hasn’t really happened on Silicon Valley. Although it started strongly – so strongly that I raved about its potential a few weeks ago – nothing about this season has felt like a finale. Worse, for a long stretch in the middle, all the momentum drained out of it. Silicon Valley should have been sprinting to the end, but it got caught chasing its tail.I think that, at its heart,the show has always been about the intersection of ethics and power. Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) was always a genius with an amazing idea – a decentralised internet – that he fought hard to keep, in the face of ruthless competition from bigger players. The first episode this year reinforced this notion, that he was the sole face of good in the curdled world of tech, and the question seemed to be whether or not he could maintain his integrity to the bitter end.But instead, he has been playing the same game of footsie with Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) that he has been dragging out for years. Belson tries to destroy Pied Piper. Richard thinks of a way to sabotage him. He tells Belson too early. Belson changes his tactics and wins. Richard snatches partial victory from the jaws of defeat. There is no movement to it. Everyone ends up back in the same place. As a viewer, it is frustrating.The Gilfoyle, Dinesh and Monica problem – they have spent years with nothing to do – hasn’t gone away either. Every second of time is precious in a final season, but Silicon Valley has spent episode after episode engaging them in sub-Cheers contests with one another to see who can get the better of HR or each otherLast week’s episode is the perfect example. With just three episodes left, the characters should have been racing to a fixed point together. Instead, there was a lot of waffle about Richard signing a meaningless pledge, while Monica and Gilfoyle attempted to boost their management statistics. That’s it. It could have been any episode from any series, which isn’t really good enough at this point.Luckily, this week’s episode seemed to at least understand that it was a penultimate episode of an entire television series. PiperNet was finally tested at scale and, without sabotage from a rival, failed. And then it succeeded, better than anyone could have anticipated. For almost the first time this season, Silicon Valley is now in brand new territory.So now we have to see where it goes. It might end with success – with Pied Piper finally toppling the established tech hierarchy. It might end with failure, asPiperNet grows sentient, ruins everything and sends Richard back to the room where he started six years ago. But whatever it chooses, Silicon Valley has to be bold. It’s the only thing that can save it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e3ad547e94ce5cebb85235a4216d18af850740/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=745c236e1106828f13ad7c333e977d4b","title":"angela merkel visits auschwitz camp for first time","story":"German chancellor says crimes at Nazi death camp will always be part of country’s historyAngela Merkel has expressed “deep shame” during her first visit as German chancellor to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Holocaust memorial and vowed to fight rising racism and antisemitism in Germany and Europe.Dressed in black, Merkel said the crimes committed at the site in southern Poland where the Nazis ran their largest death camp would always be part of German history.“This site obliges us to keep the memory alive. We must remember the crimes that were committed here and name them clearly,” Merkel said during a ceremony attended by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.“I feel deep shame given the barbaric crimes that were committed here by Germans,” she added.The German chancellor also pledged a donation of €60m (£51m) towards a fund to conserve the physical remnants of the site of the barracks, watchtowers and personal items of those who died, such as shoes, spectacles and suitcases.Before her speech, Merkel and Morawiecki toured the camp’s crematorium where victims’ bodies were burned. They walked through the camp’s iron gate bearing the motto Arbeit macht frei (Work sets you free) and visited the barracks. Since becoming chancellor in 2005, Merkel has paid her respects at other Nazi concentration camps, and she has been five times to Israel’s Holocaust museum and Yad Vashem memorial.Poland’s foreign ministry called her visit “historic” in acknowledgement of the unique status Auschwitz has in the world’s collective memory. The ministry also noted it was only the third visit to the camp of an incumbent head of a German government.Helmut Kohl went there twice, in 1995 and 1989. Before him, Helmut Schmidt was the first ever to visit in 1977. Merkel has previously visited both Dachau – the first Nazi death camp – and Buchenwald, together with the former US president Barack Obama.No official reason has been given as to why this is the first time in her 14 years in power that she had visited the most notorious of the Nazi death camps. But speculation is rife in Berlin that she was keen to do so ahead of the possible collapse of her government, after repeated threats from the incoming new leadership of her junior coalition partner the Social Democrats to withdraw from government.A rise in the number of antisemitic attacks in Germany has led to pressure for her to take a symbolic stand, especially following a brutal attack in front of a synagogue in the central city of Halle two months ago, in which two people were murdered by an attacker claiming he was driven by antisemitic motives.Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, who is accompanying Merkel, along with Romani Rose, the chairman of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, said he welcomed her visit, calling it an “important signal at a time of a swing to the right” in Germany.There is no other memorial site that so emphatically brings home the events of the Shoah than Auschwitz,” he said. Rose said that even 75 years after its liberation “the former Nazi death camp and the industrial mass murder that took place there still makes visitors shudder”.Schuster has repeatedly warned of the dangers of Alternative für Deutschland, the leading opposition in the Bundestag, one of whose figureheads, Björn Höcke, has called for Germans to make a “180-degree” turn in the way they perceive their culpability in the Holocaust, and referred to the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin as a “monument of shame”.A huge rise in the number of visitors, from about 1 million five years ago to 2.15 million last year, has posed a particular challenge, the memorial’s director, Piotr Cywiński, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, saying that visitors often tried to take home objects from the former death camp as souvenirs.Nazi forces killed an estimated 1.1 million people at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex during their occupation of Poland during the second world war. Most of the victims were Jews transported from across Europe to be killed in gas chambers. Tens of thousands of other people were killed there too, including Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma. The camp was liberated by the Soviet army on 27 January 1945."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a89ec0cce047cdaa6e51f7a4b52887627595e77/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61f06f8fb066135ae1e47e85290bae04","title":"its a free country now saudi arabia touts new openness","story":"Urban elites have largely embraced cultural transformation but elsewhere there is fear and angerRayan and Maha sat on the ground smoking, their schoolbags beside them and their smartphones blaring pop songs. School was in full session but they were at the mall, and they didn’t seem to care who knew it.Both girls were uncovered, their abayas held together by only a few buttons, as women dressed more conservatively in full black robes and niqabs breezed by carrying babies and shopping bags. Men in traditional thobes walked past without turning their heads, but the pair caught the eye of a Brazilian man wearing shorts and two full-sleeve tattoos, who stopped to try to talk to them.“I can do what I want,” said Maha, 16. “It’s a free country now, don’t you know?”For the two teenagers, truanting appeared to be more an act of youthful defiance than an expression of new-found freedom. But in Saudi Arabia these days, that two girls are willing to publicly rebel also testifies to a wider change in the kingdom.Two years into a reform programme aimed at opening up a rigid society to a sceptical world, what to wear and how to behave seem very much up for grabs. Strict dress codes have been modified for locals and abandoned for foreigners, laws restricting women’s movements have been rescinded, child custody has been made more equitable and segregation of men and women has been set aside.The Saudi capital, a bastion of cultural austerity and oppression for nearly four decades, is now accepting allcomers. Wrestling troupes, global performers, homegrown singers, and boxers – including the world heavyweight champion Andy Ruiz Jr, who on Saturday faces Britain’s Anthony Joshua in a title rematch in Diriyah – are among a host of entertainers lured by the message that what was once forbidden is now welcome.The bare torsos of Joshua and Ruiz adorn posters across Riyadh promoting the kingdom’s first world heavyweight boxing match. Saudi Arabia has taken a leaf from the playbook of its neighbour Qatar, which has built its brand partly by luring global competitions including the 2022 football World Cup.So keen are leaders to tout the new openness, they held a conference during the week to discuss challenges facing the media, inviting international press including the .

But beyond the city limits, and even in the outer suburbs, the pace of change – and the fact it is happening at all – has caused resentment, anger and even shame.“I never thought I’d see this in my lifetime,” said Monira Salman Quaratah, who opened a coffee shop, Cafe Barbera, in a Riyadh suburb three years ago and on Thursday hosted a women’s empowerment forum that drew more than 15 local and foreign women to speak to a new foundation, Saudi Women Stories.“If I had tried to get such a gathering together back then, they would have shut it down,” she said. “But now this is a forum for everyone. And I couldn’t be happier. Sometimes I get a customer who complains about the music, or mixing, but I just tell them things have changed.”Among the group was a life coach, Bayan al-Hazimi, 29, who spends one week a month studying in London and the rest of her time working on a fledgling practice that she hopes will become a career.“People didn’t understand the difference between therapy and coaching at first,” she said. “But once you explain it to them, they get it. And I think it will be the same with people who don’t like the cultural changes. When they see people coming here and respecting them and our customs, they soften. The conservatives need to learn how to coexist.”Many in Riyadh and more in the country’s smaller communities seem disinclined to do that. In the eyes of some observers, rural conservatives in particular may never fully embrace the changes set in motion by the heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Salman.Cultural reforms were one plank of an attempt to re-engineer most aspects Saudi life – an ossified economy, implacable opposition to most entertainment and a rejection of anything depicting the pre-Islamic era.The push has dismantled a long-held accommodation that allowed the country’s leaders to run the affairs of state while hardline clerics defined and enforced the national character. In its place, an Arab nationalist police state is emerging, underpinned by the heir to an absolute monarchy who has ruthlessly consolidated his power base while eliminating dissent.“This isn’t just a difficult bridge to cross,” said one observer who has spent much of the past two decades immersed in conservative Saudi society. “For many, it’s actually shameful. And shame is a very powerful notion in this part of the world. They are saying this is against the values of the kingdom and of the faith, that this is an imposition which pays no heed to values or customs.“The other thing is, they won’t dare speak against what is happening, because they have seen the price to pay for doing so. There is a culture of fear in Saudi Arabia now that wasn’t there before the reforms. The pact is: you can have your freedoms, but in return you lose your tongue.”Fear of cultural erosion remains strong within conservative ranks and is amplified by the western concerts and festivals now regularly passing through Riyadh. “If the cultural aspects were more indigenous,” there would be less pushback, said a second observer. “The conservatives need to be handled carefully here.”For Hazimi, the life coach, something has clearly changed among her conservative family. “I am now regularly going outside my comfort zone,” she said. “I would not have been comfortable to express myself like this before, and nor would anyone else I know."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"DPP appealed after Appeal Court reduced man\u0026rsquos sentence for rape, threats to kill and hammer attack on wifeInjunction described as \u0026lsquovery prohibitive order on six ordinary decent people\u0026rsquo in BallinamoreDUP leader reinforces party\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquocommitment and desire\u0026rsquo to form an ExecutiveOfficer was helping social workers remove baby from man\u0027s care, court hearsSpeeding boy was chased by garda\u0026iacute after he had been disqualified from drivingDetectives believe suspect is involved in drug dealing and is part of wider criminal networkBoy\u0026rsquos mother \u0026lsquovulnerable\u0026rsquo young woman who struggled with addiction, notes reportDecawave founder recognised by IAE for his outstanding work over the past 15 years\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom so proud of my progress, I can walk and talk and eat and dance\u0026rsquoElection outcome will have bearing on approach to negotiations, commissioner saysDavid Sterling says last three years among most difficult of 40-year civil service careerFirefighters argue they should be compensated for \u0026lsquoon call time\u0026rsquo that is onerousSons of TD Michael Healy Rae attacked Kieran James after row in chip van queueTracks in Co Donegal, Longford, Co Wexford and Co Cork suggested for closureMinister for Health says experiences of those impacted will stay with him \u0026lsquofor rest of his life\u0026rsquoStatus orange warning in place for south and northwest with possibility of coastal floodingJudge notes \u0026lsquosome degree of incapacity\u0026rsquo by two Donegal men chargedPSNI recover double unit after digger is used in theft at Castle Way premisesAdvocacy groups demand solutions on handling mental health issues in justice systemCommuters in Dublin and Cork suffer as congestion grows and rings roads near capacity"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4106790.1575634507!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm atiyah to bring strong winds across country from sunday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSouthwesterly winds, later veering northwesterly will reach mean speeds of 65 to 80 kmh with gusts from 110 to 130kmh. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe A status orange weather warning has been issued for a number of counties with very strong winds expected from Sunday. The orange warning is in place for counties Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Kerry, Limerick from 9am on Sunday morning to 6am on Monday. While the actual storm will remain quite far from Ireland’s north coast, people on the west coast are advised to take extra precautions on Sunday and into Monday morning, said Met Éireann forecaster Elizabeth Coleman.There is a possibility of coastal flooding due to a combination of high seas and storm surge. A yellow wind warning is set to come into place for the rest of the country from 3pm on Sunday to 6am on Monday as winds reach mean speeds of 50 to 60 kmh with gusts of up to 100 kmh.This weekend’s storm is typical for this time of year due to the current “mobile Atlantic regime”, said Ms Coleman, adding that milder temperatures are set to continue in the coming days. “We’re at that period when it’s sometimes milder at night time than it is during the day,” she said. Temperatures will range between 6-8 degrees in the coming days, rising to 10 degrees at night. Once Storm Atiyah clears, Monday is expected to be a clear and dry day. However, milder air will bring rainfall on Tuesday and more unsettled weather. Temperatures are expected to become colder on Wednesday and Thursday. Named by Met Éireann, Atiyah comes from a list compiled by the Irish forecaster and the UK Met Office to cover the 2019-2020 storm season. The system of naming storms was first introduced in 2015 to help raise awareness of the threat and impact of severe weather in Ireland and the UK before it hits.

Photograph:   Jonathan BradyPAJeremy Corbyn has said he has obtained a confidential report which “drives a coach and horses” through Boris Johnson’s claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea under his Brexit plan.The Labour leader said the leaked document, marked “official, sensitive”, provides the “cold, hard evidence” that the British prime minister has been “misleading” people about his withdrawal deal.Brandishing a document, titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access To The UK Internal Market, at a press conference in central London, Mr Corbyn said it was proof that there would be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit.“What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson’s own government, marked ‘official, sensitive’, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,” he said.“This is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country.”The 15-page document appeared to be a slideshow prepared by the Treasury and is titled “NI Protocol: Unfettered Access To The UKIM”.Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal will be “disastrous for businesses and jobs all across the UK” and claimed the Government’s confidential report “confirms this”.The document, he said, paints a “damning picture” of the prime minister’s deal, especially when it comes to Northern Ireland.“We have now caught Johnson red-handed misrepresenting his own Brexit deal,” he told journalists.Mr Johnson had said there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain under his exit terms, but Mr Corbyn said the document suggests that is not true.The Labour leader said page five of the document states: “There will be customs declarations and security checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”He added: “It is there in black and white. It says there will be customs declarations, absolutely clearly, for trade going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.“The Government cannot rule out regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, and animal and public health checks also.“For trade going the other way, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there will be all of the above plus potentially damaging tariffs.”Mr Corbyn said the report claimed Mr Johnson’s deal will be “highly disruptive to the Northern Irish economy”.“It says this deal will be the equivalent of imposing tariffs on 30 per cent of all purchases made in Northern Ireland,” he said.The Labour leader also said the document warns of the potential for fraud, saying Northern Ireland could become a “backdoor into the GB market for the avoidance of import duties”.Last month Mr Johnson suggested his Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay had been wrong to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks as a result of the Brexit deal struck with the EU.Mr Barclay previously told MPs that “some information” and “minimal targeted interventions” would be required on goods travelling between the two areas of the UK, due to Northern Ireland remaining aligned with Dublin and Brussels’ trading rules for agricultural products and manufactured items as part of the exit terms.It comes ahead of the final scheduled head-to-head debate between Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson later on Friday, and after the Mr Johnson was berated by Andrew Neil for refusing to do an interview on his BBC show.Mr Neil said that if Mr Johnson is expected to face the likes of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin then he should be able to sit down for a half-hour interview with him.Mr Johnson has been accused of “running scared” from scrutiny by avoiding in-depth questioning from the veteran broadcaster, even though rival leaders, including Mr Corbyn, have taken part.The prime minister, who has also refused to do an interview on ITV’s Julie Etchingham, will debate with Mr Corbyn on the BBC on Friday night, with less than a week to polling day.Some 6.7 million people tuned in when the pair took part in a head-to-head debate on ITV last month.On Thursday night, Mr Neil challenged Mr Johnson to finally agree to an interview on the theme of “trust” and why voters have “deemed him to be untrustworthy”.Addressing viewers directly following his interview with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, Mr Neil said he wanted to put “questions of trust” to the prime minister.A senior Tory source claimed the public are “fed up” with TV interviews that are “all about the interviewer and endless interruptions”.“The format is broken and needs to change if it is to start engaging and informing the public again,” the source said.“The PM will focus on talking to voters about people’s priorities including investing in our NHS and helping with the cost of living.”Mr Johnson is said to have taken part in more than 100 interviews during the election campaign, and discussions on the Neil interview are understood to be ongoing.–PA "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4106993.1575641808!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elon musk s lawyer asks cave explorer to apologise for insulting submarine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTesla CEO Elon Musk (centre)  arriving  at US district court in Los Angeles. Photograph: Mark J TerrillAPJurors were expected to begin deliberating in Los Angeles on Friday in the lawsuit brought against Elon Musk by a British cave explorer who says the Tesla founder defamed him with tweets suggesting he is a paedophile.The three-man, five-woman US district court jury will likely get the case before noon on Friday, after a federal judge instructs them on the law and lawyers for both men deliver closing statements.The jurors will be asked to decide by unanimous vote if Mr Musk (48) defamed Vernon Unsworth with three July 15th, 2018 tweets, and if so how much he must pay in damages.Legal experts are closely watching the proceedings, which is believed to be the first major defamation lawsuit brought by a private inidual to go to trial over a tweet.Mr Unsworth on Thursday declined to apologise for a July 13th, 2018, CNN interview in which he said Mr Musk’s offer of a mini-submarine to help rescue a boys’ soccer team from a flooded Thailand cave was a “PR stunt” and the wealthy entrepreneur could “stick his submarine where it hurts”.“Do you believe Mr Musk is so cold-hearted that he was sending over this sub with no regard for the children’s lives?” Bill Price asked Mr Unsworth. “Are you willing to apologise to Mr Musk for saying that it was just a PR stunt?”Mr Unsworth, who brought the suit against Mr Musk after the Tesla and SpaceX chief referred to him as a “pedo guy” on Twitter, declined.“My insult was to the tube and not to Mr Musk personally,” Mr Unsworth said. “I’m not sure how I need to apologise. It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion.”‘Humiliated, ashamed, dirty’After two days of testimony dominated by Mr Musk’s global celebrity, the British cave explorer took centre stage in Thursday’s proceedings. Mr Unsworth had testified feelingly on Wednesday about the impact of being “branded a paedophile” by Mr Musk’s tweets, which were published by an account with approximately 22 million followers. “I feel humiliated, ashamed, dirty – I was effectively given a life sentence without parole.”But under cross-examination, Mr Unsworth’s own words were placed under the microscope. Additional questioning appeared designed to undercut Mr Unsworth’s claim to have suffered emotional distress over Mr Musk’s words.After it was established that Mr Unsworth had not mentioned such distress in many thousands of text messages exchanged over months with a half-dozen friends, the 64-year-old said: “I very rarely talk to my friends about my emotional issues, certainly not in text messages. I bottle it up.”Mr Price also displayed a photo of Mr Unsworth and other members of the British rescue team taken with Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street. “You would agree that the prime minister of England would not want to be seen with someone who is a paedophile?” Mr Price asked.In discussing his investiture as a member of the Order of the British Empire, Mr Unsworth said that Prince William “suddenly mentioned the situation that existed with Mr Musk”. However, the judge prevented Mr Unsworth from relaying what Prince William said about Mr Musk.On Tuesday, Mr Unsworth had testified that the great honour of his MBE was clouded by his shame at the “pedo guy” smear, and said he only attended his investiture because his mother, partner and niece asked him to.Film and booksFurther questions addressed Mr Unsworth’s involvement with various film and book projects about the cave rescue. Mr Unsworth said that he briefly engaged an agent and hoped to sell his story for a substantial sum, as others involved in the rescue have done, but none of the projects materialised.Mr Unsworth did assist with three book projects for free, including a children’s book, and was paid a total of £2,600 (€3,080) for appearing in two documentaries, he said. Mr Unsworth works as a financial consultant and earns approximately £25,000 annually, he testified.Dr Jim Jansen, a professor of computer science at Penn State university, provided expert testimony for the plaintiffs on the “level of online dissemination” of Mr Musk’s “pedo guy” statement. Dr Jansen testified that 490 articles had appeared on 361 websites in 33 countries about Mr Musk’s remarks, based on searches limited to the English language and excluding articles about Mr Unsworth’s litigation.The jury also heard excerpts from a video deposition by Mr Unsworth’s wife, Vanessa Unsworth. The couple have been living separate lives since around 2006 but remain married. Vanessa testified that her husband was “really devastated” by Mr Musk’s remark and said she was “incredibly proud” of his actions in the cave rescue.Asked about Mr Unsworth’s criticism of Mr Musk, she said: “It is a comment that, as Brits, we do say: ‘Stick it where the sun doesn’t shine.’”Mr Musk’s defence attorneys did not call any witnesses. The defence asked the judge to decide the case on the law, arguing that “no reasonable jury could find for Unsworth on the basis of law”, which the judge refused to do.In his own testimony earlier this week, Mr Musk (48) apologised to Mr Unsworth and said he did not believe the cave explorer was a paedophile.He also dismissed the tweets as an “off the cuff” response to watching a replay of Mr Unsworth’s CNN interview, at a time he felt overworked from running Tesla, which makes electric cars, and SpaceX, a rocket company that offered the mini-submarine.To win his lawsuit, Mr Unsworth needs to show Mr Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified him and caused him harm. He does not need to show that Mr Musk acted with “actual malice”, which is much tougher to prove. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election 2019: John Major urges voters to back rebel candidates over Conservatives - latest newsAngela Merkel warns of new wave of anti-Semitism as she visits AuschwitzJo Swinson has been forced to defend her feminist record after admitting she has no power to kick out Lib Dem peer accused of sexual harassment How the SNP could win 50 seats and push for Scottish IndependencePlaid Cymru manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesScots voters warned against sleepwalking into \u0026#39brutal and corrosive\u0026#39 indyref2 Green Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesBrexit Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policies Lib Dem manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesComment: Far from an \u0026#39oven-ready\u0026#39 Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn is cooking up a rigged Remain recipePolish headteacher sacked after organising surprise terror drill that left children needing counsellingMorrisons bans sale of new vegan pork pie in Melton Mowbray over fears it will offend locals The slow extinction of our public libraries is a quiet tragedyTeenager pleads guilty to throwing a child from the Tate viewing platformLabour Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesConservative Party manifesto 2019: summary of key election policiesHow will the 2019 general election result affect Brexit?Boris Johnson turns down Andrew Neil as ally condemns \u0026#39tired format\u0026#39Will tactical voting actually work in this election?

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth.

Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Only two acts have been announced for next year’s Glastonbury so far, with Paul McCartney confirming his appearance last month (18 November) and Diana Ross confirmed for the festival’s “legends” slot.Taylor Swift is currently tipped to be another of the festival’s headliners next year, with co-organiser Michael Eavis confirming that one of the two headliners left to be announced is a woman.“You would love her to bits – everybody does – but no names at the moment,” he told BBC Somerset.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cost of rice fell to six-month lows as new crop arrivals added pressure.The vegetable-oil price index rose 10.4 per cent to 150.6 points, reaching its highest since May 2018, led by firmer palm-oil prices, which strengthened on robust import demand, increased biodiesel use and concerns over possible supply shortages.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Firefighters work to contain a large fire at an industrial building at Inlet Road inn Auckland, New ZealandDoan Quynh Nam Tran of Vietnam competes in the women\u0027s gymnastics at the SEA Games (Southeast Asian Games) in ManilaA youth plays on foamy discharge, caused by pollutants, as it mixes with the surf at a beach in ChennaiSoutheast Asian Games at the Royce Hotel, Mabalacat, Philippines.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter.

Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  In Islamic eschatology, Al-Masih ad-Dajjal is an evil figure comparable to the Antichrist – whose name translates to the false messiah, liar, the deceiver in Arabic.\u0026nbspTwitter user @frankoceanhafiz tweeted: Crying @ the fact that Muslims figured out the twist ending of the Netflix \u0027Messiah\u0027 show bc they LITERALLY NAMED THE CHARACTER DAJJAL.In response, one Twitter user wrote: Goes to show you that english speakers also dont look into the meaning or context of the concepts they use - that they borrow these concepts merely because theyre \u0027exotic\u0027 to other english speakers, meant to entertain an audience of english speakers and probs no one else (sic).Messiah\u0026nbsphas received a considerable amount of hype ahead of its release in 2020.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have accepted the result and I support Boris’s deal. The country must move on.It is fundamental to democracy that we implement the will of the people. Yet too many MPs have forgotten they promised to abide by the people’s decision.They spent three years trying to frustrate the result. Now they want to waste the next five doing the same.Every time one of the ultra-Remainers’ spurious claims is defeated, they invent another.They said Boris could not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and Brussels would not budge. Boris stood his ground and proved them wrong.Now they say we will face a new clf-edge No Deal at the end of next year unless a trade deal is completed with the EU.But there is no comparison with what faced us before. We will have left the EU by then.Two big concerns — citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland — will have been dealt with.It is true that time will be tight. For that we can blame the MPs who did everything in their power to delay our exit.But Boris has proved he is an effective negotiator. Both sides want a trade deal and our economies are already aligned, making agreement easier.With a working majority, Boris’s hand will be stronger and the job will be done. Ultra-Remainers have conjured up this new No Deal spectre because they are desperate.They know thatBoris wins the General Election, we will leave the EU by the end of January and the game will be up.Their second referendum campaign is in tatters and the Liberal Democrats’ pledge to revoke Brexit has bombed.The clock is counting down to an election that could settle the issue once and for all. So they are resorting to ever-more ludicrous claims.So-called moderates should be ashamed of the insults they are hurling at Boris.It is absurd to call his agenda “far-right” or “extreme”.This language should be reserved to describe hateful movements such as the BNP or the National Front.It should not be casually thrown around by fools who have been so blinded by their hatred of Brexit they have lost all sense of proportion.Boris was a successful Mayor of London who won a second term and delivered for the public.His plans to boost funding for schools and the NHS, for more police and to increase the National Living Wage, are clearly mainstream.When Boris calls for tougher sentences for violent criminals, he is speaking squarely for the millions of quiet Brits who share these views.They hate being branded as extremists by metropolitan elitists who have lost touch with everyday concerns.Liberal Conservatives like me are entirely comfortable supporting today’s party.I have marched alongside Boris for gay rights. I have heard him speak passionately about protecting the environment. I have walked down streets and seen him connect with people like no other politician can.I cannot understand how anyone who previously called themselves a Conservative could bring themselves to urge people to vote against the party at this election.That is tantamount to saying Jeremy Corbyn should be PM.These Tory turncoats justy themselves by claiming Brexit will damage the economy. But the public rejected that argument when they voted for Brexit.And you can’t warn about jobs and investment while being willing to allow the catastrophic impact of a government led by Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.Never in my letime have I seen an agenda like Labour’s today: Ruinous nationalisation spending pledges the country cannot begin to pay for theof crushing union power a leader who has consistently sided with our country’s enemies and who refuses to tackle endemic racism in his own party.This isn’t the loony left. It is the lethal left.It is a blood-red recipe to crash the economy, impoverish our public services and relegate Britain to a third-rate power.No moderate should even consider supporting it. One by one, former Labour MPs are calling out Corbyn, warning us of the dangers.Why can’t the ultra-Remainer former Tory MPs and muddled old warhorses like Lord Heseltine, who once understood the threat of socialism, see it Blinded by their hatred of Brexit, they say the election offers a Hobson’s choice between two extremes.That is hogwash.

It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion.”He added: “I don’t think he was cold-hearted, but I do believe it was a PR stunt.”The Brit, , also revealed Prince William spoke to him about the situation that existed with Mr Musk when he awarded him an MBE at Buckingham Palace.The judge stopped him revealing more about the conversation after an objection from Musks attorney.Earlier he had said his upset over the pedo guy tweet meant he could not enjoy the inauguration on what should have been one of the proudest moments of his le.The court also heard from Mr Unsworths estranged we Vanessa, who said he was really devastated by Musks slur and any suggestion he was a paedophile was totally .She said she is incredibly proud of his role in the rescue, despite their split in  when he was already in a relationship with his Thai girlfriend Tik.Mr Unsworth, a financial consultant who splits his time between Thailand and the UK, is seeking unspecied damages from the boss of Tesla and SpaceX - who admitted hes worth bn.In his own testimony, he insisted his tweet was not meant to be taken literally.He told the court he did not know the caver was part of the rescue team when he sent his off the cuff tweet.He said: I just thought he was some random creepy guy the media were interviewing.I thought at the time he was unrelated to the rescue.And he added: There are a lot of things that I say.

The Prime Minister.We have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming. No broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed. But leadersapos interviews have been a key part of the BBCaposs prime time election coverage for decades. We do them on your behalf to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy. Weaposve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have, all of them. Until this one. It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. The theme running through our questions is trust, and why so many times in his career in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. It is of course relevant to what he is promising us all now. Can he be trusted to deliver , more nurses when almost , in his numbers are already working for the NHS. He promises  new hospitals but only six are scheduled to be built by .  Can he be believed when he claims another  will be built in the five years after that. Can he be trusted to fund the NHS properly when he uses a cash figure of an extra £bn  After inflation, the additional money promised amounts to £bn. He vows that the NHS will not be on the table in any trade talks with America. That he vowed to the DUP, his unionist allies in Northern Ireland, that there would never be a border down the Irish Sea. That is as important to the DUP as the NHS is to the rest of us. It is a vow his Brexit deal would seem to break.Now he tells us heaposs always been an opponent of austerity. We would ask him for evidence of that and we would want to know why an opponent of austerity would bake so much of it into their future spending plans. We would ask why, as with the proposed increase in police numbers, so many of his promises only take us back to the future - back to where we were before austerity began.

Police bodycam footage shows cops scaling the tree at nighttime and laying hands on the -year-old  after his spree of attacks on women and children. They talk to him amid the branches and haul him down after Britainaposs most wanted man had fled from police across Stoke. The serial knepoint rapist is now facing le behind bars for a terrying cocaine and vodka-fuelled spree of attacks against  women and children in Watford, London and the North West. Other CCTV from houses Stoke show McCann fleeing across the street and garden-hopping through peopleaposs houses as he was hunted by hundreds of officers while he went on a rampage attacking victims aged between  and  in April and May this year. As police closed in, McCann forced two -year-old girls into his car by threatening to chop them up with a machete. He was captured on CCTV buying condoms at a service station before he was spotted by a patrol car, which gave chase. Jurors were shown dramatic dashcam footage of police chasing the rapist as he reached speeds of up to mph and veered into the wrong lane of traffic to overtake a car in Congleton, Cheshire, on May . The Fiat drives the wrong way through a roundabout, crashes into a Mercedes and heads into a neighbourhood at speed. McCann eventually abandoned the car, leaving the two terried girls behind, and dashed through a garden before taking a bicycle. Later, he was caught in a taxi at a police road block, but he ran off into a field, having changed into a wet T-shirt snatched from a clothes line. A police helicopter finally located him up a tree, he was coaxed down and arrested early on May . McCann changed his appearance and moved across five police force areas as he evaded police for  days despite telling his first victim his surname. On his arrest, the violent offender, who had convictions for burglary, told police: If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldnapost have happened.  It can now be reported that four men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of assisting McCann and released under investigation. It can now be reported that he zoned out and cowered under a blanket on the floor of his cell rather than face jurors in court. McCann refused to attend his trial, but appeared by video link from prison in the absence of the jury to beg for an adjournment. Mr Justice Edis refused, ruling that McCann had no real intention to come to court. Jurors today convicted him on all  counts, including rape, kidnap and  imprisonment, following a trial at the Old Bailey in central London. The convicted burglar had been freed after a probation error before he went on the spree while allegedly being helped by a support network.  McCann, who had addresses in Aylesbury and Harrow, refused to attend his trial and chose not to give evidence. His claim to have had consensual sex with some of his victims was dismissed as ludicrous. The rapist, of Harrow, west London, had denied the charges. The Ministry of Justice has also launched an inquiry into why McCann was not recalled to prison after committing a burglary following his release from an indeterminate sentence for aggravated burglary. Instead, McCann was automatically freed having served half of his sentence on February .  It is understood one Probation Service worker was demoted as a result of a review of four staff who had direct contact with McCann. The court heard how two months after his release, in the early hours of April , McCann snatched a young woman from the street in Watford and raped her in her bed. The woman reported the attack to police, McCannaposs details were put on the Police National Computer and a prison recall was issued. But McCann remained at large and on April  he abducted a -year-woman as she walked home from work in Walthamstow, east London, just after midnight and subjected her to a -hour rape ordeal. McCann made her call him daddy and say that she was a child. Hours later, he was caught on CCTV bundling another young woman into his car in north London, as her sister ran off screaming.  The two captives escaped outside the Phoenix Lodge in Watford, after the -year-old woman hit McCann over the head with a vodka bottle. She told jurors she was determined to survive and used her logic to seize her chance to incapacitate him. The politan Police circulated a CCTV image of McCann at the Phoenix Hotel and received a tip-off with his name following a public appeal. Earlier on May , McCann tricked his way into the home of a woman he met in a bar in Greater Manchester, tied her up and molested her children, aged  and . The teenage girl, who described McCann as evil, jumped out of a first floor window to alert police. As McCann ran out after her, the -year-old boy cut his mother free, saying: Mum, mum, we are safe.saved us.

Now the -year-old has revealed how devastating depression led to her being passed from pillar to post, struggling to feed her son and left at the mercy of the brutal Universal Credit system. Rachel said: My depression got really bad and I wasnapost getting the help I needed. I didnapost get out of the house for three months. I just sat in my bedroom and it just escalated.  Thereaposs a lack of support, getting a doctoraposs appointment was dficult. You just get passed from pillar to post, from council to crisis team, to doctor.  And that gets you even more depressed. You keep telling people your situation and repeating yourself, and getting nowhere. Are you a struggling parent   Email webnews@mirror with your story Rachel is from Grimsby, where one in four residents are on low incomes and one in two children grow up in poverty. Universal Credit, which was introduced in  by the Tories, has made it a lot harder, Rachel says. She said: They should never have brought it in, itaposs the worst thing they did. Thereaposs that many people struggling on it. You are getting paid once a month,something happens in the middle of the month, you are in trouble. Itaposs harder to budget.    When it was fortnightly, you didnapost struggle so much or worry so much, you can budget for two weeks at a push, but not monthly. In another cruel blow, Rachel is being punished for missing a job seekeraposs appointment which she was unaware of as she does not have a phone or an internet connection. This led to her Universal Credit being sanctioned and a large amount being taken from her payment. This is why, when the television cameras came to her temporary home, she only had p to her name after enduring a particularly hard month. Iaposm struggling with myself, Rachel says. I cry a lot, mainly when Iaposm on my own. But Iaposm getting there, Iaposve got a lot to focus on, I just donapost have the energy to do it. Her son Bradley is  this month and Rachel says heaposs the only thing keeping her going, the only thing she has to live for. As long as my son is eating, I can manage, she says. Heaposs a growing boy, heaposs at college four days a week so my main priority is making sure heaposs fed, heaposs happy - and looking for a permanent house.But with her next Universal Credit payment coming just five days before Christmas - on the th - she hasnapost yet been able to buy her son a Christmas card yet, which she said hurts but itaposs good that heaposs old enough to understand. Rachel says she sees a lot more people struggling now, compared to five or  years ago.  Everyone says they canapost help you, so they pass you on to everybody , said Rachel.  Sometimes it feels like you donapost have a voice. Youaposre on Universal Credit so you dont have a voice, or youaposre homeless so you donapost have a voice.  Weaposre still human beings at the end of the day. Since Rachelaposs plight was highlighted in the Mirror, Grimsby Live and the BBC, people have come forward with offers of help for the desperate mum.One person has even offered to provide her with a place to stay other than the homeless accommodation she finds herself and her son in. Rachel said: Iaposm a bit overwhelmed, itaposs amazing. Itaposs blown me away how many people want to help. But I didnapost do this for that, I just wanted to get it out there I didnapost expect any of it. It was just to make people aware of how bad it is in Grimsby. Itaposs not just about myself.  Pam Hodge runs the The Rock Foundation Food Bank, based in the former Holme Hill School, and said you can make a donation to the foodbank and state that it is for Rachel. Sheaposs going to need everything for the home such as furniture, a cooker, a bed, electrical appliances - you name it, she said. If they give her money it could affect her benefits. Sheaposs been overwhelmed by the generosity and is keen for it go to help other people as well. People have been very generous, and itaposs raising awareness of whataposs going on in Grimsby, Rachel is just one of many. If you make a donation to the foodbank then everyone can have a good Christmas.  Pam said Grimsby is a very deprived area with fourth or fth generation unemployment.

My Christmas suits are not that distracting, theyaposre not about seeking attention -people want to put their attention on me, thataposs their decision.

Sandeep and Reena Mander were forced to adopt from overseas after Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council rejected their application to join a register of approved adopters because of their Indian ancestry. The couple, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, were told there was only white British pre-school children available for adoption and their chances would be improvedthey looked to the sub-continent.Mr and Mrs Mander, who had undergone several years of unsuccessful IVF treatment, tried to get the  decision reversed and won the support of their local MP, the then home secretary Theresa May .With the backing of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the couple, who are in their s, sued the local authority for discrimination. Following a four-day hearing at Oxford County Court, Judge Melissa Clarke ruled in their favour and ordered the council to pay each of them general damages of £,.. The couple was also jointly awarded special damages totalling £,. for the cost of adopting a child overseas. She said: I find that the defendants directly discriminated against Mr and Mrs Mander on the grounds of race. I consider that there is clear evidence that Mr and Mrs Mander, who I have found expressed willingness to consider a child of any ethnicity, received less favourable treatment than would a comparable couple of a dferent ethnicity. All of this discloses, in my judgment, what the unknown social worker stated in the very first phone call with Mr Mander, namely that Adopt Berkshire operated a policy of placing adoptive children with parents who come from the apossame backgroundapos, namely race. The judge also made a declaration that the council directly discriminated against the couple in the provision of adoption services on the grounds of race.  But she rejected the Mandersapos claim that they had also suffered discrimination under Article  of the European Convention of Human Rights and the right to found a family. Lawyers for the couple said the judgment was a landmark ruling with the finding of racial discrimination in adoption law. This decision ensures that no matter what race, religion or colour you are, you should be treated equally and assessed for adoption in the same way as any other prospective adopter, Mr Mander, a vice-president of sales at an IT company, said. We believe our experience with Adopt Berkshire was not just an isolated event. When we went through the Intercountry adoption process we came across many couples who had similar experiences. Let us be clear, a childaposs welfare is the most important thing when looking for any prospective adopter. However matching cultural values and beliefs is just one of many areas that should be assessed when looking at the suitability of adopters to ensure that childaposs welfare. It should never be the overriding factor to stop you even being considered, which is what happened to us. And certainly, cultural values and beliefs should never be assumed based on an ethnic tick-box, as was our experience.  We felt there needed to be a change. This is what this case has all been about for us, to ensure discrimination like this doesnapost happen to others wishing to do this wonderful thing called adoption. And todayaposs landmark ruling will ensure this doesnapost happen again. Mrs Mander, who works as a programme manager for a telecoms company, added: Today is such a relief and is a relief that we can change things for other people and not face racial discrimination. It is absolutely amazing. We know we can move on knowing we have changed something for the better. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission which funded the case, said: The law is very clear. We should not be treating people dferently when they are offering loving homes, just because of where they or their parents come from. The coupleaposs lawyer, Georgina Calvert-Lee, said: Todayaposs judgment is a victory for all British children who need loving adoptive homes, and for all the eligible, loving adoptive British families hoping to welcome them into their lives.

CCTV footage shows Gabriel Taye being hit to the ground at Carson Elementary School in Ohio, USA. While the eight-year-old lies helplessly on the floor, students wander around him, stopping only to poke and prod his motionless body. It allegedly took several minutes before an assistant head teacher came to his aid. Two days after the  incident Gabriel was found dead next to his bunk bed by his mum Cornelia Reynolds. He is said to have loved to sing, dance and play football, as well as dressing up for school in neckties. Gabriel had dreams of joining the military and once visited Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. His parents allege that the school did not tell them what happened on the day of the suspected attack, instead explaining that he had fainted. School officials in turn claim Gabriel did not tell them that he had been hurt by other children and had no visible injuries, the Washington Post reported. The tragic incident has come into mainstream conscious two years after it unfolded as the parentsapos wrongful-death lawsuit is heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the th Circuit.  Prosecuting lawyer Jenner L. Branch argued that the school should be held legally responsible for violence that happens on site. “These parents had no idea how dangerous his third-grade school was,” Branch said, according to Courthouse News Service. “These parents had no idea what was going on at Carson Elementary School.” Gabriel was targeted by bullies before, the lawsuit alleges, and was hit twice.  Lawyers representing Carson Elementary School argue it is immune from liability because they have no responsibility to eliminate violence between students. Cincinnati homicide Detective Eric Karaguleff watched the full CCTV footage and told the Washington Post how a boy pulled Gabriel to the floor when he walked into the bathroom. He said that the eight-year-old lay on the floor for five minutes while students mocked and nudged him. “I witnessed behavior that in my belief is bullying and could even rise to the level of criminal assault but due to the apparent age of the children involved my current opinion is it could be better dealt with appropriately at the school level,” Mr Karaguleff wrote.The school districtaposs lawyers refuted the suggestion and said that they did not ignore a pattern of students bullying the young pupil. “While we are concerned about theof time that Gabriel lay motionless and the lack of adult supervision at the scene, when school administrators became aware of the situation, they immediately followed protocol by calling the school nurse to evaluate Gabriel,” the school district previously said of the bathroom incident in a statement. Ms Reynolds claims that the school nurse told her Gabriel had fainted and that his vital signs were fine.  When she asked her son what had happened, he said he only remembered falling and hurting his stomach. Gabriel was taken to hospital after vomiting that night, only for doctors to diagnose him with a gastrointestinal issue. His mum kept him from school the next day but sent him back in the day after.

The day Broughty Ferry’s leboat Mona went down in a gale while out on a shout in the Firth of Tay, with the loss of all on board.The Mona had gone to the aid of the North Carr lightship, which was adrt in St Andrews Bay, and was last seen clearing the Tay in treacherous weather at .am.The lightship was saved but the Mona was found capsized at Buddon Sands four hours later.Her crew – coxswain Ronald Grant, George Smith, Alexander Gall, father and son John Grieve and John T Grieve, George Watson, James Ferrier and David Anderson – all drowned.The men of the Mona, all volunteers, lived and died by their motto that day – you have to go out but you don’t have to come back.James Ferrier was Penny’s uncle, her mother Lily’s brother. Penny, now , said: “I was  at the time and I don’t think I had ever seen my mum cry before that day.“I was really affected and very upset. We were living in England where my mum had moved from her home in Broughty Ferry after the war.“It was devastating news from home.”On the same day, nine-year-old George Anderson was off school with tonsillitis and staying with his granny, Elizabeth Anderson, on Fisher Street in Broughty Ferry. George’s father, David Anderson, was on board the Mona.George said: “I clearly remember a commotion at my granny’s door and I remember that everyone was desperately trying to find my mum, Lexie, who was at work in the Ferry.“Mum never even made it home before she was told about the tragedy and what had happened at sea.”The bodies of seven of the crew were eventually recovered. Only the body of George Watson was never found.‘RNLI saved my le – now I have joined the crew to help others’ Le-saving family includes policeman, plumber, paramedic and an undertakerIn a poignant twist of fate, George Anderson recently found an old photograph of the crew, with the diminutive George Watson completely hidden by the figure of James Ferrier in the front of the picture.George said: “I know beyond doubt that George Watson is in that picture behind Jim.“My mum had the picture and she knew that George was behind Jim, even although it’s almost impossible to tell that he’s there.”Penny said: “It was a very sad time. Mum immediately went back to Broughty Ferry and although she continued to live down south she kept in touch with her family there until she died.”Following Lily’s death, Broughty Ferry’s RNLI crew kept a promise to her and took her ashes on the boat and scattered them at sea, where so many of her family perished. vw, px\"  Penny said: “I also want to come home to Broughty Ferry to be buried at sea.”As for the young George, he lived with his mum and siblings in Broughty Ferry with the widows, children and families of the crew, and supported by the community.George said: “My mum was left a widow to bring up three boys. It was obviously a very dficult time for everyone.“Although I struggled at the time to fully appreciate the consequences of what happened, I knew that one day dad was there and the next day he wasn’t.”George has been an active supporter of the RNLI ever since, holding concerts on the th and th anniversaries of the tragedy and raising more than £, for the station in the process.A memorial service is to be held in Broughty Ferry on Sunday, before wreaths are dropped at sea by the leboat and her crew."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/5de8fae99cb164.30451460-448x564.jpg ","title":"dee must handle setbacks better","story":"Dundee can’t afford to feel sorry for themselves as they struggle for form in the Championship ahead of Saturday’s trip to face Arbroath.That’s the opinion of manager James McPake as he called on his experienced players to ensure his team can put out a much-improved performance this weekend at Gayfield.The Dens gaffer pointed to the lack of response from his side after conceding the opening goal in Saturday’s - defeat to Queen of the South and has challenged his players to do better.He said: “Of course, goals do change games and particularly when you are at home on the back of two defeats.“People do look too much into conceding the first goal.“You can concede at any time and by no means should it be a defining moment in any game –you say the first goal is so important thenyou concede you basically are saying the game is over.“I thought we recovered a wee bit but it wasn’t great. It was a bit like the Morton gamewhere we were flat.“I don’t think that was entirely down to the first goal but you could see it did have an effect.“When that happens, though our experienced players and the group should be able to get back to doing what had caused them real problems for the first ,  minutes.“We were much more of a threat in the opening stages but we must be better at handling setbacks.”James is backing midfielder Graham Dorrans to lt his side, too, over the next few weeks.“There is an expectation that comes with certain players and he’s one of them,” the Dens gaffer said. “He had two-and-a-bit years out and now he’s played  games.“He’s getting to the point where he is match sharp and he’s now fighting for his form, which is coinciding with a team on a poor run.“My concern would behe was struggling with injuries and he’s not.“You can still see his quality in flashes but it takes more than one man to make a team click.“Everybody needs to stand up as a group and be better.“He’ll prove the quality that he’s got.“Teams are now putting a man on him and we have to counteract that.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

The site borders the golf course and St Martinrsquos Cemetery.A formal planning application, which should set out exactly what is planned, is yet to be submitted.The local authority says it wants to create a ldquotransport hub with associated parking spaces and ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.If approved, this would, says the council, have ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town centre for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.Work on the project,approved, could begin as early as April next year.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"holding-politicians-account-duty-not-bore","story":"Tuesday nightrsquos encounter was not an exact replacement for Kylersquos late and unlamented three ring circus.

Scotlandrsquos educational performance, on which the country has always prided itself ndash rightly or wrongly ndash was revealed to be a dangerously leaning tower. Reading levels were up, but performances in maths and science were falling and at record lows. Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at Edinburgh University, described Scotlandrsquos overall performance as ldquostagnating in mediocrity.As well as being taken to task on education, the subject on which she has asked to be judged first and foremost, the First Minister was asked about the state of Scotlandrsquos hospitals.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media iFShJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests iFShJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This was not the first time she had been tackled on the subject on television. There was Andrew Neilrsquos now famous question to her on November  in his BBC show.After stating that only two of eight waiting time targets had been hit, Neil went on: ldquoChildren are dying in a new Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated, perhaps by pigeon droppings. A new multi-million pound Edinburgh hospital, should have opened in , is still unfit to open. You canrsquot even get the ventilation system to work. Yoursquove got the worst drug addiction problem in Europe but you cut drug treatment budgets by pound million. You clung on to your last health minister, you are under pressure to sack her successor. Yoursquove called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon : Sturgeon acccuses think-tank on analysisIt was a blistering inquiry. To be fair to Ms Sturgeon, she had responses for both Neil last week and her interrogators on Tuesday. To Neil, she pointed out, among other things, the pound million being put into meeting waiting time targets, the public inquiry into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and the ldquoextremely high public satisfaction ratings for the NHS in Scotland. In the STV debate she highlighted the improvement in reading.The question here is not how she performed in both instances. She is an impressive politician, on the national and international stage. But why does it take a General Election for her to be challenged so robustly  Why are there not more such encounters For all Andrew Neilrsquos talents, he did not fall out of a magic interviewer tree. He is smart, fast, has a certain dogged style and command of facts and puts them to good use. Similarly, there was nothing radically dferent about the STV debate, other than the participants were allowed to cross examine each other, an innovation all other televised debates should adopt.There is no doubt that the First Minister regularly puts her record forward for scrutiny. She does it every week at FMQs for starters. It should be noted, too, that like the other party leaders, but not Boris Johnson, she went into the Neil den. He has been frit she was not. Over the past few weeks she has appeared in countless debates and phone-ins.Yet as far as television grillings go, it is only in the Neil interview and the STV debate that she has been robustly held to account.Granted, the notion that Scotlandrsquos First Minister is somehow given an easy ride will be laughable to some. Of the near dozen national daily newspapers in Scotland only one, our sister paper The National, openly backs independence and, by implication, the main party supporting it.Of the rest, as any visit to the newsagents will show, no-one would suspect them of being cheerleaders for the FM, and some are ferocious in their criticism.As for the BBC in Scotland, it comes under frequent attack for alleged bias, a charge it denies.This is not solely about the media, however. It is about a political culture that has become too settled and not questioning enough.In part the failure to hold the FM and her Ministers to account can be put down to the calibre of opposition politicians. A fair number, not all, are simply not good enough. Nor is the Scottish Parliament always sitting when problems arise.: Candidate leaflet defacedI do not believe that the First Minister is given an easier time of it because she is a woman. If anything, the opposite is true.The trouble goes wider than any branch of the media, or inidual politician. A few months ago there was a dust up on Twitter between Muriel Gray and Val McDermid. The row flared over a tweet by the BBCrsquos political editor Laura Kuenssberg and whether or not it showed bias against the FM. Ms McDermid said: ldquoI used to respect you @bbclaurak. Insulting a politician for doing their job, however, reduces that respect to shreds.To which Ms Gray replied: ldquoMocking politicians of all and every party instead of beatying them used to be the norm in Scotland. We were rather good at it. The bedrock of Scots humour. Not sure I even recognise this lsquoworship the great leader or rsquo thing. Itrsquos so not ...Scottish. And so it went on.Did Gray have a point  Is there enough distance in Scotland between the government and the governed, or after so long with one party in power has the situation become cosier than is good for us Every government makes mistakes. All governments can do better. There have to be ways of pointing that out that donrsquot meet with accusations of bias or unfairness.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmThe Orcadian’s OutreachCLAN campaign has raised £,. for an expansion of CLAN’s vital charity services in Orkney — over double what the appeal set out to achieve in August.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But to be able to now officially say we have raised over twice the amount we set out to achieve is absolutely amazing. The donations came in thick and fast, and we are so grateful to all of those who contributed in any way. Orkney is a tremendously generous place, and the community has yet again come up trumps!#The rest of the money came in from donations from generous iniduals and businesses across the county, via a the newspaper or through The Orcadian website.“All of the money raised in this campaign will stay in Orkney, and is earmarked for this project, so we will very much look forward to seeing how the CLAN team get on with their plans.“They make such a dference to all of us who have been affected by cancer in any way, by giving advice, a supportive shoulder, support, therapies — even organising a roof over our heads during treatment.“They are truly amazing, and this money will mean that more people can benefit from the fantastic work they do.”#The monies raised, by the people of Orkney and further afield, through The Orcadian’s ‘OutreachCLAN’ appeal, will enable us to reach out to more people across the county who are affected by their own or someone ’s cancer diagnosis, and for that we are truly grateful.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense. In the way society works here, there is something we recognise instantly.

Mark Twain made it popular in America but mistakenly attributed it to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Apparently it originally came from an anonymous writer. At least that’s what it said on the internet, so it must be true, right Political spin and misinformation are nothing new, butfeels like the balance has tipped to the point where you genuinely cannot trust the majority of political information you see now on social media or hear on the television or radio – especiallyit comes from any of our main parties.: Nicola Sturgeon believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Tories getting majority: Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sister among Brexit MEPs quitting to back ToriesOutright political lies are now the norm. And I don’t knowwe can ever go back. Chancellor Sajid Javid was at it yesterdaymorning. He told Sky News that the  per cent rise in homelessness since  – when the Conservatives won a majority – was the fault of the Labour Party, who lost power in .The Conservatives have since issued a statement saying that he “misremembered” a statistic, but it was more that he got caught red-handed telling a flipping great fib. And Javid was meant to be one of the saner ones. But maybe there are none. And maybe we don’t want any.Feeding our biasesAll our political parties are indulging in the worst kind of deceit and manipulation. Spin and propaganda have always existed but when you genuinely need to fact check everything our political leaders say, you’re off to the wacky races.But do we actually care  Or are we so deeply polarised and entrenched in our camps that we are happy to feed our not-so-unconscious biases and feast on our daily diet of manipulated truth and misinformation  Do we even bother to fact-check anything as iniduals, or is that prospect as appealing as getting a new quote for your car insurance – because that may be something we all have to think about doing far more in the future.And there’s an interesting generational ide. According to new research by Intuit Research, the older you are, the less likely you are to fact-check a news story. Only  per cent of over-s polled said they would check facts to confirm the truth of a story, compared with  per cent of --year-olds.Given that older people are more likely to vote and lean towards the right and Brexit, you can see why the Tories are shamelessly pushing their fake news marketing to the limit. This is a vital voting group for them, and they are being ruthless.And it’s not just the Tories. Jeremy Corbyn has told us anti-semitism is all sorted. Jo Swinson has told us she’s going to be Prime Minister and is on course for a landslide.I don’t think there is way back. There never was a halcyon era in which the public had unwavering faith in what their politicians said, but we are now entering a Black Mirror world of wilful deception.I once did a  with Brian Stelter, who hosts the show Reliable Sources on America’s CNN.

The rail network is a gt to journalists, like no other area of transport, and not necessarily in a good way.While there are good news stories - like falling crime rates, and lowered fences for baby deer, to give recent examples - too often the industry attracts the opposite type of coverage.Shrinking coffee cupsApart from the perennial fare rises, delays and overcrowding - the booming railways are a victim of their own success - the industry has a propensity for repeatedly shooting itself in the foot.Like Network Rail’s failure to check bridge heights, which nearly forced the cancellation of the newly-restored Flying Scotsman locomotive’s triumphantto Scotland.Or incoming ScotRail Abellio asking staff to cut its predecessor First’s logo off their unorms. Or even First’s stewardship including shrinking the size of coffee cups on trains because it couldn’t cope with demand.Discontented workers and passengers don’t hold back on leaking me the bad news - like the latest ScotRail staff survey results, or its decision to scrap seat reservations. Then there’s the seemingly never ending woes of the new Caledonian Sleeper.By contrast, those responsible for promoting the railways need to up their game because far too often the “positive” news stories I write about rail are ones I have found myself.Perhaps Sir Eric might have recognised the predicament. In his inaugural presidential address to the institute in , he described the railways as the “great predominating factor in transport”.However, he said that despite their modest rate of , they “have figured in the minds of the masses as a great, bloated capitalist organisation, an object not of sympathy but rather of suspicion and jealousy”.A century on, I don’t have such prejudices, and I don’t go out looking for bad - or good - stories about the railways, or any other forms of transport, despite what some vocal conspiracy theorists claim on social media. I’m also not looking for ways to criticise - or praise - Sir Eric’s successors as transport ministers or the governments they serve.I’m just looking for interesting stories that our readers will find compelling, unexpected oruseful. I remain keen to hear from whistleblowers when things go wrong, but I’d equally like to receive new and interesting information from those who want to champion the railways.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"some working parents simply can t make things work that must change kelly ann woodland","story":"While there has been some progress in helping working parents, it can still be tough to juggle children and a career, writes STV News at Six presenter Kelly-Ann Woodland.Returning to work after a career break is tough going. Throw a teething baby and a brand new role into the works and it’s an emotional rollercoaster. A tiring, guilt-inducing, fraught, high-speed rollercoaster of a ride that never slows down. On the one hand, you get to go to the toilet by yourself at work. On the other, there’s a good chance you have a Cheerio in your hair. Many organisations are changing rapidly to ease ing to work and there are support groups out there to build confidence and help with the military-style planning that’s needed to balance work and family le. The opportunity to front flagship news programme The STV News at Six came when I was on maternity leave with my second son. I was six months in, with my head firmly focused on my kids. But this was my dream job and one I’d worked hard for. It would mean more hectic days, considerable planning, a y commute, a live show and a race home to put the kids to bed. So, was I right to go for the job I’d wanted all my le, despite the timing  Absolutely. For me, this was about making the right choices for the kids in the long-term and setting a good example. I wanted them to see you can go for the big jobs, irrespective of obstacles.: This is how maternity and paternity leaves around Europe compare: SNP unveils ‘game-changing’ plan for  weeks ‘Daddy leave’After clinching the job, I focused my efforts on trying to achieve that much-coveted work-le balance. I had a positive conversation with STV where we agreed new hours so that I could do the nursery and school run in the morning. I’d recommend going to employers with a reasonable but flexible plan and being open to a conversation about how you can both make it work – and thankfully, STV were receptive to this.As a family, we figured out a childcare plan, with my husband adapting his schedule and taking on afternoon pickups. I spend half my commute on the phone, organising the kid’s schedules. Loads of those calls are to my mum, who I’m very thankful to say is a godsend, especially when the kids are unwell.Exhausted before hitting motorwayLike loads of parents, there are mornings when I feel exhausted before I’ve even hit the motorway. And I’m not even going to get into the scrutiny of the appearance of women on screen, especially one who’s been woken up several times in the night before going live to half a million people each night. It simply shouldn’t matter.Alongside millions of other working parents, I’ve so many balls in the air and sometimes they come crashing down. I’ve still not managed to strike that perfect balance but a flexible working policy, an understanding boss, a support network and good childcare all help enormously. I’m trying to get into mindfulness, because self care is important too.There are many working parents with way greater demands on them, and many can’t make it work. There’s still so much more progress to be made. We need increased awareness that working parents can reconnect with their working self, they haven’t lost all their skills amidst a sea of babygros and sleep deprivation and should be encouraged to have a realistic conversation with employers about what works for them.If you see a job or promotion that you think is right for you, don’t be put off by the fact you’re on maternity leave. Be bold, be brave and seize the opportunity.

Wealth and power imbalances stop people with erse lived experiences from interacting, negotiating and working to understand each other, but more importantly to negotiate a common good that is equitable. “We should never forget that much of our own culture and infrastructure is a product of imperialism and dominance. Built on tobacco and cotton harvested by enslaved people, profits from people starved and forced off their land, or backbreaking heavy industries, Glasgow has the opportunity to create a new future.”The blueprint – which envisages Glasgow being “globally recognised as a leading creative and cultural world city” – highlights how it is now home to  dferent cultural organisations, including the national orchestra, theatre, opera, and ballet companies, and is also “blazing an internationally acclaimed trail in contemporary art, design and music”.However, it also states that although culture has been “central to Glasgow’s evolution for at least  years, the city should not be constrained by so much reverence for the past that the new can never become established”.A spokesman for Glasgow Le, which runs cultural venues for the council, said: “This new plan has been developed to build on all that the city has achieved and is a starting point for a renewed conversation led by Glasgow’s creative community.“We want to consolidate Glasgow’s position as a truly international arts capital – nurturing and showcasing the best in local and international creativity, design and music.“We would encourage anyone with a role in the sector to respond to the draft plan and have their say during the consultation period to help shape the final version.”David McDonald, deputy leader of the city council and chair of Glasgow Le, said: “Our new draft plan seeks to set out what the city can do to ensure that culture in Glasgow continues to flourish over the next  years.We know that participation in culture – whether it’s watching a play, creating your own piece of art or singing a song - is a force for good, and an enabler of community empowerment that can increase our quality of le. In Glasgow, we have a vibrant cultural sector that gives the city an edge. It inspires, questions and challenges us to see our city and the world in dferent ways.Having just been named as the UK’s top cultural city we need to now create the conditions in which our confident cultural sector can develop and grow, and where our artists are nurtured in their work.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election poll snp on course to add an extra 11 mps","story":"A YouGov poll for the Times puts support for the Scottish National Party at  per cent, up one point on polling in August.The Tories are on  per cent, up eight points from the last poll, while Labour remains on  per cent.They are followed by the Liberal Democrats with  per cent support, the same as in August, and the Greens with  per cent, down three points.Writing in the Times, he said: \"Most of the seats being defended by the Conservatives are highly marginal.bull : General Election : Heres what the latest polls tell us about who will win the election\"Consequently, eventhe party retains all the support it won in , it could still lose a signicant number of seats , as our poll suggests, support for the SNP increases.\"The analysis suggests the Conservatives would secure eight seats in Scotland, the Liberal Democrats four and Labour one.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed the poll.He said: \"This stunning poll is a huge boost for the SNP in the final days of the election campaign - but there is a lot more work to do before polling day.\"This poll shows that it is only a vote for the SNP at this election that can lock Boris Johnson out of No , protect the NHS and see Scotland escape Brexit - and we will be pressing that message right up until pm on polling day.\"The SNP is the main challenger in every Tory-held seat, the strongest party of Remain, and the only party offering people in Scotland a choice over our future.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon believes tactical voting could be key to stopping tories getting majority","story":"Scotlands First Minister said she felt there may be more tactical voting at this General Election than ever before as she urged voters to oust Conservative MPs in Scotland by voting SNP.Ms Sturgeon spoke out on her partys newly unveiled bus with \"Stop Brexit\" emblazoned on the side.She said: \"The way to escape that mess and to focus on building a better Scotland is to make sure that the Tories and Boris Johnson dont get that majority theyre looking for.bull : Nicola Sturgeon rejects IFS claims SNP plans will mean more austerity in an independent Scotland\"In this election people are thinking very carefully, I think there will be potentially more tactical voting than weve seen in previous General Elections and in Scotlandyou want to vote tactically to stop the Tories, then the way to do that is to vote SNP - were the challenger in all the Tory-held seats.\"Before the biodiesel-powered battle bus embarked on its first journey, Ms Sturgeon told reporters on board that another Conservative Government would \"take Scotland down a path on Brexit - and on so many other things - that all of the evidence says most people in Scotland dont want and dont support\".bull : Poll: Half of Scots believe NHS has got worse since Nicola Sturgeon became FMCalling for Scotland to have the chance to have another say on independence, she added: \"This election will not decide whether or not Scotland becomes independent but it can send a very strong message that people in Scotland - whatever their views on that question are - want it to be decided here in Scotland.\"We dont want our future to be dictated by Boris Johnson, whose strings are increasingly being pulled by the ultra-Brexiteers in his own party and by people like Nigel Farage and even Donald Trump who - despite the denials - we all know is itching to get his hands on the National Health Service.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party.

Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Ads for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingFrank McCoubreyGerry Carroll\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.The mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Mr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Mr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.\"Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.\"The compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. \"Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable. South Belfast currently seems set toto the party and be represented at Westminster by a new female face."},{"url":null,"title":"the election tv debate what you need to know","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ensured smooth trade arrangements, ease of travel between countries and the EU supported our peace process both politically and financially.”“There are lots of pressing issues at the moment – the ongoing crisis in the health service, education funding, welfare mitigation payments, infrastructure projects. However, it is the same Tory led government that has slashed the budget provided to the Executive over the past several years.”“This election is crucial in sending a message to the British government that the people of Mid Ulster reject Brexit and reject the continuing financial austerity imposed by Boris and his millionaire cabinet.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says there is a “deepening crisis” and this winter we must be prepared for “unprecedented risks” to quality of care and patient safety. He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-running plans suffered a further setback in recent weeks when it emerged that student intake for the  academic year had been ruled out. The revised target is recruitment for .In its initial phase the Medical School will be based in existing buildings at the Magee campus. Annual running costs of poundm had been quoted by the Department of Health.Ulster University has provided a breakdown of costs, details that would’ve formed the basis of its business case submitted to the Department of Health.The university says it will cost poundm per year to train  medical students, a third of which goes directly to Health and Social Care Trusts.An Ulster University spokesperson said: “In its initial phase of implementation the medical school is intended to be delivered within the existing campus estate, alongside current medical and healthcare provision.“The projected running cost for  medical students by  , when the Graduate Entry Medical School would be fully operational, is poundm per year. This is the annual cost to train doctors to completion of their Foundation training.“Of this, almost poundm is University funding for teaching and appointments and just over poundm is for the Trusts and GP practices whilst the students are at University. Just over pound.m goes directly to the Health and Social Care Trusts for the salaries, essential further training and assessment of just over  of our qualied medical graduates once they are Foundation doctors working in hospitals, caring for patients. “Annual costs for the implementation phase over the first four years of operation are considerably lower.”Plans for a medical school in Derry have been ongoing for the past fteen years before truly taking shape in  when its case was submitted to the General Medical Council.The first cohort of students were due to start training at Magee this year but that target was missed and planned intake for  has now been shelved.The Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Care and its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together. Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications. Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional poundm per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of the University of Ulster in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.It is anticipated around  doctors will train in Derry in the schools first year, rising to  students per year within its first five years. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera top the group on score dference, putting them into a McCormick Cup semi-final against Omagh CBS and the MacRory Cup quarter-finals in February. They were beaten by Letterkenny on Tuesday, more emphatically than the - to - scoreline suggests, but their mauling of Cavan in an earlier round helped their cause.

In their final game, with nothing to be gained, they led St Ronans for much of the hour before changing their team around and falling to a third defeat. googletag.cmd.push The winners of Cavan and Magherafelt will play St Macartans Monaghan in round .

Mr Murphy was in court last week to contest the costs the department is seeking from him. He lost his judicial review in  in the High Court and Court of Appeal and failed in his application to have the case heard in the UK Supreme Court. However, he and his campaign supporters remain hopeful that the matter will be heard in the highest court in Europe, the European Court of Justice. “The Court of Appeal, acknowledging that my case was of public interest, made no order as to costs. The United Nations and the IPCC have issued warnings as recently as this week that countries must make their protected areas bigger and more connected. They have called for a five-fold increase in efforts.”“What is unfolding at Lough Beg is the complete opposite of what the Northern Ireland government must do in the face of the planet’s climate and ecological emergency.”He stated that: “The DfI’s reckless disregard for the climate crisis and the well-being of countless future generations, swans, orchids, insects, otters and eels is a crime against the planet. “Under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives as transposed, the deliberate destruction of a protected habitat such as the wet grassland at Lough Beg, which is ally linked to the Lough Neagh and Lough Beg Special Protection Area, is a wildle crime.”“What continues to motivate him is the hope, shared with thousands of others, to save something of le on earth that is accepted to be special and rare, an ecosystem that could be infinitely giving. “Lough Beg is Ireland’s premier freshwater wetland for bird le. It’s  bird species are more than any other inland site in the whole of Ireland. Since  it is listed as a Ramsar Site of International Importance as a Wetland for Water Birds, and was designated a European Special Protection Areain .”He adds: “Lough Beg’s wild swans, lapwings and curlews that my we, Doris Noe, and I have watched and loved for  years have no way of coming to court themselves. “In the absence of membership organisations such as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trustand the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds– who we discovered have bought into the scheme – Doris and I went to court to speak on behalf of this wetland and its wildle.”“We spoke the truth about what we know of climate science and ecology. We presented incontrovertible evidence and statements of fact, together with relevant case law and statutory law. “Through time consuming cross-referencing and Freedom of Information enquiries we uncovered numerous, serious irregularities which the Department for Infrastructure, its consultants and the RSPB, have until now covered up. “For example, the suppression of ‘inconvenient’ advice, evidence, legal or scientic information out of date conservation objectives distortion and manipulation of essential data the absence of expert, independent or objective consultation other than that received from its statutory conservation advisors all of which was either concealed, conflated or ignored.”“The inclusion in the scheme of a suite of mostly meaningless and unproven measures agreed between the department’s consultants and the RSPB poses a grave risk to all protected wildle and their habitats. “The European Court of Justice has deemed identical measures in Ireland, Holland and Germany to be unlawful.”“This unlawful ‘mitigation’ includes carrying out research into a discrete population of wild swans for the purpose of testing theories relating to controlled disturbances during the construction of a dual carriageway on top of their ancestral wintering home. This ‘research’ commissioned by the developer and paid for by the taxpayer is a wildle crime in itself.”He added: “Our legal action was the last resort in a long-running campaign to save Lough Beg. We are heartened to see that the public discourse is coming to understand the dangers of environmental degradation we were trying to highlight in court. I met the court’s Taxing Master on Wednesday and am faced with paying costs awarded against me by the High Court in April , invoiced almost two years later.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event at Littlehands SureStart in Rosemount was to promote the importance of registered childminders For the last  years NICMA has been delivering support services for Registered Childminders who provide , day care places for children across Northern Ireland. Teresa McKeever, a Registered Childminder from Derry, said she gets great satisfactionfrom what she does. “I love childminding. I’ve been doing the job for less than a year, although I have been involved in the childcare sector for over  years. Every day I have a real sense of job satisfaction. You can really see children grow, develop and learn. Childminding plays a transformative role in children’s lives. The training, checks and visits are critical to keep the children safe and it’s only what you would expect,you were leaving your child with someone to ensure peace of mind. googletag.cmd.push “As a Registered Childminder, I am professional in my approach and I am committed to continuous personal development and training. I would encourage others to consider childminding as a career. It is so rewarding and the flexibility it offers means you can choose how many hours you wish to work every week.” Patricia Lewsley-Mooney CBE, NICMA CEO, commented: “The Festive Bake Off is just one part of a wider programme of activity which has been organised to encourage parents to consider the many benefits that come with using a Registered Childminder to care for their children. At the event, children will be baking healthy treats and doing some Christmas crafting. These are the type of creative activities Registered Childminders do on a daily basis with the children in their care. googletag.cmd.push “It is important that parents think about their choice of childminder. We know that parents ultimately want to keep their children safe, and some parents will feel that they have a choice to make between using a Registered Childminder or an unregistered childminder. However, quite simply there is no choice. The law is very clear, anybody looking after children for more than two hours a day, for reward, must register with the Health and Social Care Trust. Registered Childminders will have completed Access NI Checks on all iniduals in the household over the age of  and will have Public Liability insurance cover. “A Registered Childminder will also be required to update mandatory training every threeyears. They will be registered by the Trust and inspected on an annual basis by Early Years Social Workers. These checks help to keep your child safe, so you really should carefully consider who is looking after your child. In addition, NICMA provide advice and work in partnership with other organisations such as Family Support NI and the Western Childcare Partnership , who detail local services and information to support you and your family.” Throughout this year and next the Western Childcare Partnershipwill be supporting the awareness campaign to which it is hoped will also promote childcare as a career option to address the decreasing number of childcare places within the area and also to challenge unregistered childcare within the WCP locality.

The victory elevated Derry to seventh place in Division C, where they sit just three points off third placed Omagh. It was perhaps more hard fought than it should have been, but the win over Bangor was ultimately all that mattered.“Although there was only one point in it we played really well and we were the far better team,” coach Richard McCarter reflected.“The one thing we were probably guilty of was not being clinical enough and not taking our chances because on another day we could have won that by  or  points. They didnt get out of their own half until the final ten minutes. They got a late penalty which was quite far out but their kicked had kicked a couple of good conversions from the touch line so my heart was in my throat a wee bit. Other than that we were fairly comfortable. Well take the four points and move on to the next game.”Derry will welcome league leaders Enniscorthy to Judges Road on Saturday, their first home game since the victory over Clonmel on November . This will arguably be Derrys biggest test so far but McCarter is confident that things can go his teams way to give them a huge boost heading into another important game at Midleton ahead of the Christmas break.“That was the hope - that we could win against Bangor which would lead us into a big home game against Enniscorthy,” he explained. “If we can get something out of that, it would set us up nicely to go down to Midleton for the last game before the break so hopefully we can give it a rattle this week.“Its just so important and thats why these games against teams in and around us are so important to win. If you lose them you could be bottom of the table. Thats what we said to the boys before last week- it was a muct win match for us. By pm we could genuinely have been bottom of the table while a victory could have put us in the top four. Although were not exactly in the top four, we are only two or three points off third so were sitting nicely at the minute.”The season so far has not been straightforward for McCarter, Paul OKane or the players but they have been able to hang in there to put themselves in a position of real opportunity heading into the festive period.“We still cant put out the same team two weeks in a row so in terms of getting momentum and consistency its hard to do that whenever youre chopping and changing the team every week,” McCarter continued. “Thats the big thing for this block of three – getting as many familiar faces out as we can and try and build momentum. I think we can win these next two games and evenwe can win one out of the two it still leaves us in a decent position heading into the New Year and hopefully then we can get a few boys back and have the hunger to finish out the season on a real high.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show.

The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses.

He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
