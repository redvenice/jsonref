Right: Raj as depicted in the book Bad Dad. Last night critics rejected the accusation as another example of pointless political correctnessHe said: ‘It’s a stereotypical character. To target a community and suggest that community’s shopkeepers are involved in selling out-of-date food is deeply unacceptable. It’s distasteful. In most cases these shopkeepers have been the fabric of their community for decades and I am uncomfortable with that joke.‘I’d love to have a conversation with David Walliams about it just to understand what his rationale is.’Veteran anti-fascist campaigner Gerry Gable, editor of Searchlight magazine, said: ‘Walliams is planting in kids’ minds that Asian shopkeepers are villains or not to be trusted. The whole stereotyping is disgraceful. It’s the same kind of stereotyping you would have seen in anti-Semitic literature before the war about Jews cheating in business. I find it really alarming.’But Toby Young said: ‘The people shouting “racist” are nearly always white, privately educated Lefties who’ve appointed themselves moral guardians. Raj ignores sell-by dates and tries to rip off his customers, but those aren’t things people associate with Indian shopkeepers. Those are just characteristics David Walliams has given him for comic purposes.’It’s not the first time Walliams has been caught up in a racism storm.He starred with Matt Lucas in the sketch show Little Britain, which came under fire for characters such as Thai mail-order bride Ting Tong. A 2008 report condemned the series for jokes that ‘pander to prejudice’.And last year Walliams was accused of ‘yellow-facing’ after dressing up as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un for a Halloween party.Walliams and his publishers HarperCollins declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Pippa Middleton strolls streets ultra rich enclave St Barts","story":"Happy holidays: Pippa Middleton, 35, carries her baby Arthur on the Caribbean island of St Barts with her husband James Matthews, whom she married last year, following behind  Pick up a Pop \u0026amp Suki bag like PippaPop \u0026amp Suki camera bag in cognacComplete the look with the strap below!Pippa Matthews has been spotted on a family holiday in St Barts, and showing off her chic sense of style, the new mum teamed a white blouse with blue denim jeans, but the real star of the show has got to be that brown camera bag!

while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules. Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK\u0027s ability to do trade deals elsewhere.And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK. Cabinet Brexit infighting rages as Hammond is accused of...Share this articleThe PM\u0027s spokeswoman conceded today that there was as yet no breakthrough.\u0027She has been in touch with European counterparts over the break and you can expect more of that to continue this week,\u0027 the spokeswoman said.\u0027There is still work to do.\u0027Meanwhile, there is no sign of a New Year Brexit truce in Cabinet as ministers turned on Philip Hammond over funding for no-deal plans.The Chancellor has allocated billions of pounds to contingency preparations in case the UK crashes out of the EU in March.But Mr Hammond -

So begins Jack London’s White Fang, published in 1906. The wolf pack is led by a wolfdog, Kiche. The ensuing story is told from the viewpoint of Kiche’s wolf pup, White Fang, through whose gaze we view the violence of the parallel worlds of animals and humans. White Fang is the narrative mirror of London’s earlier The Call of the Wild, in which a pet dog, kidnapped and used as a sled dog, runs away to join the wolves. Wildness is the true nature of animals, though the challenges of survival in the wilderness can also turn man into a beast, London seems to say. White Fang ends up enjoying domesticity with his new master, many miles away from the Yukon. Humans have triumphed over nature, but nature is still out there.In 1952 Konrad Lorenz, a former member of the Nazi party who would later repent and go on to win a Nobel, published King Solomon’s Ring in English. A chapter imagines the start of the relationship between humans and canines. A pack of jackals followed Stone Age man’s hunting expeditions and surrounded his settlements, and were tolerated, accepted and ultimately encouraged, for the warning barks they gave at the approach of predators, and their tracking skills. The jackals, which initially followed the hunters in the hope of scraps, began to take the initiative, running before instead of behind the hunter, bringing to bay larger animals. And so was created the covenant: food and warmth in exchange for protection.In Of Wolves and Men, Barry Lopez details the hate reserved for animals whom we cannot bend to our will. For centuries in the US, extermination was enacted against wolves. Lopez details the way they were treated as outlaws and criminals, subjected to public torture and execution. Crowds gathered to watch a particular wolf die as agonisingly as possible: drawn and quartered, and left to swing on the gibbet.“The way we think about other species sometimes defies logic,” writes Hal Herzog in Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat, which does a remarkable job of describing and explaining our emotionally complicated responses to animals. The truth is that, when we treat them with cruelty and indifference, this is often the way they treat each other. Animals, though, are not hypocrites, and Herzog must be applauded for calling out humans, among them “dog lovers” whose quest for the perfect breed has caused unquantifiable amounts of canine suffering.Karen Joy Fowler’s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is a plea for the rights of animals and questions what it means to be human. A young girl is raised alongside a chimpanzee “sister”. When this animal psychology experiment comes to an end, Fern, the animal, is torn from the only family she has known and sent for rehabilitation in a chimp sanctuary. The casual cruelty of the act echoes through the family’s life for decades.Finally, how do we find a way to live together? In Coyote at the Kitchen Door, Stephen DeStefano details the interplay between urban sprawl and the natural world, which results in us living in closer and closer proximity to wild animals: the deer in the shopping mall, the cougar in the backyard, the bear in the senior citizens’ centre. Some, like the coyote and the fox, are so well adapted to urban living that all efforts to outwit them are certainly doomed. We may just have to increase the limits of our tolerance.• Happiness by Aminatta Forna is published by Bloomsbury. To order a copy for £14.95 (RRP £16.99) go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

We have, for the moment, ceased trading as the administrators take over the business ... We are all desperately disappointed at this outcome. Please bear with us as we do our best to work through the current circumstances.”The London-based company enjoyed explosive growth in its short life, selling close to 1m pairs of slippers in four years. In a recent interview with the Times, Shah said the company had identified a gap in the market for “the Nike of downtime”, and analysts suggested that the company was worth £75m-£100m. It is not clear what led to the company’s financial difficulties.Shah, who first trained as a criminal barrister, previously enjoyed success with a social media advertising company that he sold to the credit checker Experian.Mahabis relied heavily on pop-up ads to reach shoppers. Sales of the slippers, which cost around £70 a pair, were reported to be in excess of £20m.No redundancies have been made at the company, which made a virtue of its flexible work culture. Staff worked a four-day week and were encouraged to “work from anywhere and at any time”. The company published what it called a Manifesto for downtime, for a healthier work-life balance.Mahabis said customers wishing to return items would not receive a full refund and the process could take months as claims would be processed by the administrators: “We would recommend therefore that you consider carefully whether or not to actually return goods,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d8dc6fdc245ff426dcd50069c9e3596c7f1e92/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0372baeef8440d7deeff2212f721a44f","title":"wall street end of year stock market performance 2018","story":"Tariff disputes and rising interest rates contributed to the worst year for major US indexes in a decadeWall Street rose modestly in relatively light trading on Monday as revelers gathered to ring in 2019, marking the end of the worst year for major US indexes in a decade.After a strong January, Wall Street was challenged for much of 2018 by tariff disputes, rising interest rates, and fears of diminishing corporate profits.“We were very strong through most of the year, it’s really been the last quarter where things fell apart a bit,” said JJ Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “People got nervous in large part because of unknowns facing the markets.”Monday’s rally came as Donald Trump indicated on Twitter that progress had been made toward a potential resolution to the trade tensions between the United States and China which have plagued stock markets for much of the year.Trading volume was relatively light, owing to the holiday as the US federal government shutdown entered its 10th day.Healthcare and tariff-sensitive technology stocks provided the biggest boost to the S\u0026ampP 500 on Monday.Of the 11 major sectors in the S\u0026ampP 500, nine were in positive territory.

And when I wasn’t listening to the Hamilton soundtrack I wrote about Brexit.I’m late to the Hamilton party, I know. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical about the first US Treasury secretary opened on Broadway in 2015. I only got tickets to see it in London a few weeks ago, but by then I was word-perfect on the score. For the uninitiated, Hamilton tells the story of an orphan immigrant’s climb up the social and political ladders of newly independent America, culminating in a death that … well, let’s just say it puts the modern Twitter spat into perspective. Plus singing, dancing, rapping.The show takes liberties with the historical record but gets away with it because it is a work of creative genius. If only the same could be said of Brexit, which tells a mutilated version of a nation’s past without the redeeming features of witty rhyme and memorable melody. The comparison is preposterous but also weirdly compelling. After all, many Brexiteers truly see themselves leading an emancipation from tyranny.Eurosceptics have always cast Britain’s relationship with Brussels as a subjugation. Initially the villains were mere bureaucrats. But what started as (mostly) metaphorical hyperbole has been turned by bellicose and dishonest campaigning into a visceral grievance. At a public event recently I heard the young leader of a pro-leave organisation tell an elderly Indian man that her experience of growing up in Britain, as “a colony of Europe”, was analogous to his childhood under the Raj.In its most radical conception, Brexit is a war of independence. Jean-Claude Juncker is George III. Who, then are our Franklins, Washingtons, Hamiltons? Let us take the Brexiteers on their own terms for a moment. Pretend that compliance with food safety standards is an indignity exactly equivalent to harrying by redcoats. Suppose that 29 March 2019 will evermore be celebrated with fireworks as our 4 July. For this to be the case, we also have to imagine that Jacob Rees-Mogg will one day be on the five-pound note and Nigel Farage on the 50. There will be a towering Boris Johnson monument on the Mall. The collected speeches of Michael Gove will be published in leather-bound editions. Arron Banks’s cheque book will be displayed in Westminster Hall, or maybe on the Isle of Man.But leading Brexiteers do not make convincing founding fathers. The American revolution sprang from the preceding century of Enlightenment thought. Conservative Euroscepticism isn’t a philosophy, it is a complaint. The winning side in the referendum had little hinterland of intellectual inquiry and no programme, no Rights of Man, no Federalist Papers. After victory, they organised no constitutional conventions. The candidates in the race to be the Tories’ first ever pro-Brexit prime minister tripped over each other before the first fence. Foremost among them was Johnson, whose decision to declare in favour of leave might as well have been decided on the toss of a coin. He had a back-up article announcing his support for remain. Historians have yet to unearth the draft Declaration of Dependence that Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1776, thinking maybe his career path would be smoother under monarchy.More ambitious literature has emerged from the lower political isions of Europhobia. There are books by Douglas Carswell, the turncoat Tory-to-Ukip MP who quit parliament when the hard work of implementing Brexit began, and Daniel Hannan, a sideline-squatting Tory MEP who has never sought election to the Westminster parliament for whose sovereignty he crusades. Their thin volumes extol Anglo-Saxon enterprise as the essence of all global freedom. It is pseudo-intellectual Febreze, spraying a liberal economic mist to cover the smell of ethno-nationalism.And while the romantic guff about a buccaneering global Britain reeks of imperial nostalgia, I understand why its proponents furiously reject that charge. They are too young to remember the heights of empire but also they prefer the moral authority of anti-imperial struggle to the icky ethics of a project that redrew maps with white supremacism as a watermark in the paper.Brexiteers invert imperial swagger, filtering it through self-pity and projecting it outwards as victimhood and entitlement to redress. The best view from which to observe the ridiculousness of that manoeuvre is found in Ireland, which escaped British rule and is now cast in Eurosceptic mythology as the spiteful governor-general carrying out repressive orders from Brussels. The Irish writer Fintan O’Toole calls that “the ultimate colonial appropriation”. He explains: “Britain took to itself, not just the resources of the conquered people, but their suffering and endurance. In its Brexit iteration, England audaciously dreams itself into the colony status it once so triumphantly imposed on others.”Tory leavers have failed to sustain an optimistic account of Britain’s post-European future, so instead they retreat into a sado-masochistic urge to re-enact past privations. This explains delight at the idea of a no-deal Brexit. There is a generation of Conservative MPs who seem perversely traumatised by the peace and prosperity of the Europe in which they grew up. As my colleague Matthew d’Ancona has pointed out, resentful at having missed out on the blitz, they crave opportunities to prove that they would have had the spirit for it. They have slipped from celebrating Britain’s record of standing alone against forces of darkness into willing a sequel.This represents the confluence of two streams of British political culture. One is anti-intellectualism – admiring the gentleman dilettante who gets by on bluff and charm, socially superior to the sweaty scholarship boy who over-thinks and over-works. The other is moral complacency in holding up victory over fascism in 1945 as proof of eternal immunity to dangerous dogmas.While past revolutions were driven by ideas, Brexit is strangely uninterested in them. To the likes of Johnson and Farage, ideas are a bit foreign. But Britain will not get through 2019 without some idea of what to do next. A bubble inflated by decades of pomp, ignorance and vanity will burst. The correction can come in one of two ways. The UK will not leave the EU, having collectively decided that the task cannot safely be done. Or it will leave the EU, and discover that none of the things that were promised from Brexit can be achieved without help from Europe. Both routes are painful in different ways. Either way, I don’t think future generations will be idolising the authors of our present dilemma. None of this is meant as a denigration of Britain. To the extent that any country has a national character, ours can be said to include virtues of stoicism, ingenuity, pragmatism and moderation. Those traits will help us through the coming year.But the great achievement, celebrated by posterity, will not be Brexit but the recovery from Brexit. And the heroes will not be the Brexiteers, but the leaders who come along afterwards to clear up their mess – and without making a big song and dance about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/967d017d1cba10cd1d65361aecf5ff717f5ddafb/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15a1bc378d4f7a421f5d6227fb44d88a","title":"brexiteers britain look east asia singapore","story":"In a few weeks, Singapore observes the 200th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles’ arrival. The spot where he landed is marked with a statue – arms folded, looking out to sea – while the 52-storey headquarters of a local bank towers behind him. It’s a popular selfie spot.Singapore’s government plans a series of exhibitions and historic walking trails that will turn the spotlight on the island’s long and successful history – both before and after the imperial adventurer strode ashore and planted the union flag in January 1819.Back in Britain, the Tories are marking the Singapore bicentennial in zanier fashion. The British government is reviving the idea that a post-Brexit UK will be freed to play an enlarged role in world affairs, once again floating the idea of a Singapore-style economic model but coupling this with talk of new military bases overseas.Jeremy Hunt, writing in the Mail on Sunday, declares admiration for Singapore for plugging into the “international economic grid” after independence in 1965: “there could be few better instructions for us as we make our post-Brexit future”, he writes. Hunt urges a strengthening of Britain’s links with some of the world’s most dynamic economies. Gavin Williamson, interviewed in the Sunday , calls for Britain to be a “true global player” after Brexit with an enhanced military role in south-east Asia and the Caribbean.Both interventions combine a grain of sense with a dose of disturbing fantasy. It is true that Singapore – along with Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong – reaped huge benefits from globalisation in the 1960s. And the rapid growth of Asia’s middle class today makes this region fertile ground for Britain’s services sector. It makes sense for Britain to combine an economic tilt to the Pacific with a stronger defence role, too. From Singapore to Australia, the west’s military partners in the region would welcome a strategic counterweight to China.But Britain in the 21st century is a very different place from 1960s Singapore. Led by a government ruthlessly focused on growth, Singapore made enormous gains from export-oriented industrialisation – but this took place with two conditions that modern Britain lacks.Hunt is right to draw attention to Britain’s peerless reputation as a global supplier of higher education. The UK is home to three of the world’s top 10 universities. But his government’s attitude to migration – foolishly insisting on counting overseas students towards the net migration target – risks doing needless damage to this sector. The UK could be pushed into third place as a global destination for overseas students, behind the US and Australia, while Canada is rapidly catching up in terms of student numbers.Meanwhile, more than four decades after Britain’s comprehensive withdrawal as a military presence in the region, Theresa May’s government is stepping up defence ties in the Middle East and Asia. In April, Britain opened a permanent naval base in Bahrain – the first such base east of Suez since 1971. The UK will open a military training base in Oman in March 2019.There is a plausible argument for this engagement – if economic power is shifting east, then so are Britain’s strategic interests. China’s economic rise has been accompanied by an increasingly assertive attitude in the vast maritime region that Beijing regards as its backyard. This has presented countries such as Singapore and Australia with a tricky challenge. For both, China is their biggest trading partner while they look to the US as a partner for security. As tension between Beijing and Washington grows, countries that look both ways will come under increasing pressure. They will need all the friends they can get.But Britain lacks the appetite to be a global military power. After Iraq and Afghanistan, the challenge of winning domestic support for military intervention abroad is immense, as David Cameron discovered over Syria. And our capabilities are modest: Britain’s surface fleet shrank from 78 vessels in 2013 to 72 vessels in 2017. Though the fleet is now growing again, it will remain below the 2013 figure. The defence select committee reported a few years ago that the surface fleet was “way below the critical mass required” for the tasks confronting it.If the Tories are serious about a pivot to Asia, their actions must chime with their rhetoric. Britain could make itself far more attractive to international students by restoring their right to work in the UK after graduation. A genuine military revival east of Suez requires increased naval capability, or greater discretion over which tasks the navy is asked to do. There is scope for a true “look east” strategy, but it would involve making difficult choices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23828499c603cb88b256310ae7eb74c1809727f/0_14_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e50a6b8d3f8764f719895c6ae27b9b7","title":"the guardian view on us china antagonism","story":"Many of those peering with trepidation into 2019 have first turned to the past, to see what lessons history offers as a great power rises and the hegemon falters. Some look back two and a half millennia to the Peloponnesian war and the idea of the “Thucydides trap”: that war is made inevitable by the emergence of a new power (Athens) and the fear of the established leader (Sparta). Others draw on more recent transitions to suggest that powers moderate behaviour in times of decline or retrenchment. However it plays out in the long run, there is trouble ahead – and not only for the US and China.Mr Xi has ditched Deng Xiaoping’s maxim that China should hide its light and bide its time, instead asserting it as a great nation “approaching the centre of the world stage”. Beijing is cautious in tackling Washington, and probably sincere when it says it does not seek global hegemony. It wants international order, and the US is useful in maintaining it. But it also wants to reshape that order – and its growing reach poses new challenges.The sheer ambition of Mr Xi’s landmark Belt and Road Initiative is daunting. A deadly attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi has highlighted the potential vulnerability of one key element, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which runs through volatile areas where it is impossible to free-ride on US-created security. Beijing is undoubtedly preparing for these issues. Actually meeting them may be another matter, especially as it deals with the reaction of its public on the one hand and international players on the other.As a candidate, Mr Trump spoke of China “raping” the US. His stance resonates with voters in places where manufacturing vanished, with the jobs resurfacing half a world away. (That it helps to distract from Russian election meddling, and questions of his campaign’s complicity, is surely a bonus.) A year ago, the US national security strategy described a new era of “great power competition”. In October, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, gave a speech widely regarded as a harbinger of a new cold war. Some fear that in the longer run a hot war is not out of the question, perhaps with growing tensions over maritime power in the Pacific leading to missteps or misunderstandings.Yet the advent of Mr Trump should have been an opportunity for China as well as a danger. Instead, the turn against Beijing is not only due to “death-by-China” hawks. It has happened across the political spectrum, and across the west. Those who once hoped for liberalisation see no hope in the face of the increasingly stifling and authoritarian domestic situation, exemplified by Nobel peace prize-winner Liu Xiaobo’s death in custody, the detention of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims without charge or trial, and the axing of the presidential term limit, effectively extending Mr Xi’s rule indefinitely.Abroad, there is increasing alarm around China’s “sharp power”: its attempt not just to seek support, through typical public diplomacy, but to determine and control views overseas, often through covert means. It is increasingly strident in its rhetoric: last year it declared that the Sino-British joint declaration on the return of Hong Kong – a legally binding agreement – no longer had “any practical significance”. In Asia, where there have long been concerns about China’s militarisation of islands in the South China Sea, anxiety is spreading about its broader influence. Beijing’s 99-year lease on the Hambantota port – taken when Sri Lanka could not afford to repay hefty loans – has set alarm bells ringing. In Africa there is popular as well as elite concern about potential debt traps. But nations there are understandably unimpressed by a man who reportedly called them “shitholes” and whose recent “Africa strategy” is blatantly more about China than the continent. Another US president might steer a defter and wiser course, yet still might not provide more of the money and infrastructure they are seeking.In this charged and delicate environment, smaller nations are especially vulnerable, either as incidental damage or because they are a safer target than the US: Canadian citizens are essentially being held hostage in the Huawei row. The US president not only humiliates his allies but offers to undercut them. Other countries must attempt to pick their way through, defending their own interests.To do so they need to devote more attention and resources to understanding what China is doing and why it matters, neither ignoring nor reflexively opposing its actions. Beijing’s “16+1” diplomatic platform with central and eastern European nations is perfectly legitimate, but the EU should follow its work closely. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will provide much-needed funding its operations also deserve close scrutiny. Especially keen awareness is needed of the attempts to reshape narratives and muffle discussion of human rights.Tactics matter too. Any attempt to target the Chinese diaspora would be wrong and counterproductive alarmingly, the Trump administration reportedly considered ending Chinese student visas. And when the US president does not show allies respect, as his outgoing defence secretary has made clear, solidarity elsewhere is all the more crucial. The EU’s members have a tendency to sell out long-term collective interests for short-term inidual advantage. Yet it is essential. And Britain is now choosing to go it alone.That is especially perilous when our economies and people are interconnected as never before, with common as well as competitive interests. Some fear the danger of China doing not too much but too little. On climate change it is stepping up as the US steps away – albeit falling well short of what is needed. The past offers necessarily imperfect parallels for this globalised age. It can warn us of traps and obstacles, but cannot plot the difficult path ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39eed6f0d408139af0229312608bacc1c7c36022/0_9_3442_2071/master/3442.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=922d5b9f4e2a5c625b0a53be35302f0f 1880w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of fizz","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘fizz’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘fizz’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what fizz means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 January at 10am.

Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge. Alongside the award-winning chefs and popular eateries is the much-loved BeaverTails pastry stand: its speciality is a huge doughnut flattened into the shape of a beaver’s tail then smothered with a topping.

The city’s national museums are another strongpoint, partly for their distinctly Canadian twist. From reconstructed polar environments to birch-bark canoes and contemporary art, all provide a wonderful window on the nation.The Canadian Museum of History has a particularly insightful glut of historical artefacts, including an extraordinary totem pole collection. For greater insights into today’s Canadian culture try the National Gallery of Canada, where airy contemporary art displays steal the show from old masters. Better still, take in a show at the dynamic National Arts Centre, whose bilingual performing arts programme includes all sorts of music, dance and theatre. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot appears in November and the NAC English Theatre has highlights of Prince Hamlet, Angelique and The Pigeon King early next year.Ottawa has a reputation for a dramatic climate, based on temperatures that swing between –30C and +30C and, no matter the weather, the city excels at making the most of the outdoors all year round.An extraordinary 500-mile network of cycle paths, many groomed for skiing in winter, is a key asset and with many being attractive riverside affairs, getting about by bike is often the best way to see the city.Otherwise, the Gatineau Hills are the main destination for summer hiking and biking, while in winter they support one of Canada’s premier cross-country skiing networks, as well as good snowshoeing to remote cabins and some downhill skiing at Camp Fortune. All this is nicely rounded off by the Nordik Spa-Nature with its medley of rustic saunas, hot tubs, treatments and massages.Avoiding Ottawa’s January and February extremes might seem wise, but then you’d miss all the fun of the February Winterlude festival – a carnival of ice sculpting, canal skating and BeaverTail bingeing. Instead, don’t worry about the temperatures – Ottawa always seems to take the climate in its stride.Take to the river in the summer months you can go white-water rafting on the Ottawa River.

The race weekend features a 10km runwalk, a half marathon, and a full marathon that takes participants through Fogo’s beautiful, untamed wilderness. If you’re not running yourself, you can cheer on the returning marathoners in the picturesque village of Tilting, or go for a scenic hike through the island’s 200km of paths and trails. It’s worth the ferry ride alone to stay and dine at the architecturally stunning Fogo Island Inn. Fun fact: members of the Flat Earth Society consider the island one of the four corners of the planet.Canadian Football: 106th Grey Cup – Edmonton, Alberta, 25 November 2018The biggest night of the Canadian Football season will take place this year in Edmonton, Alberta, with the 106th Grey Cup game. A five-day, fan-friendly festival precedes the big game, a Canadian tradition dating back to 1909. This Grey Cup game is outdoors, so if you can snag a ticket, be sure to bundle up ... and don’t forget your face-paint. Canadian football, with its unique quirks, is particularly popular in Western Canada where fans never sit on their hands, no matter how cold it gets.

Perfect for all beginners, flag football is a great non-contact introduction to Canadian Football and friendly Edmontonians.World Junior Hockey Championships – Vancouver, British Columbia, 26 December 2018-5 January 2019The World Junior Hockey Tournament has become a favourite year-end tradition in Canada, as the best young hockey players on the planet take part in a two-week tournament that culminates in a must-watch gold medal game. This year, Vancouver, BC, plays host at Rogers Arena, where traditional rivals Team Canada and Team USA remain the heavy favourites, with the young Swedes of Tre Kronor a close third. If that inspires you to lace up your own skates, check out the Robson Square Ice Rink, a beautifully lit, domed outdoor rink in the heart of Vancouver. An evening skate is popular with locals, and many of Van City’s best nocturnal snack options, including some top-notch food trucks, are close by. Skates can be hired for as little as Can$4 (£2.40).Curling: the Tim Hortons Brier – Brandon, Manitoba, 2-10 March 2019You can cut the tension with a broom at the Tim Hortons Brier where the country’s best male curlers have competed to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships since 1927. This year’s tournament takes place in friendly Brandon, Manitoba. The 2006 Olympic gold medallist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador was skipper of last year’s championship team and the eventual winner of the World Curling title. If you want to take a crack at some rock-hurling yourself, head down the highway to the historic Granite Curling Club in Winnipeg. Known as the “St Andrews of curling” for its contribution to the sport in Canada, this historic club has produced its fair share of Canadian curling royalty, including Victor Alvin “Vic” Peters.Snowboarding and freestyle skiing: Jamboree 2019 – Quebec City, Quebec, March 2019The 2019 International Ski Federation Snowboard and Freestyle Ski World Cups will be awarded at Jamboree, Quebec City’s annual extreme winter sports festival.

Not surprisingly, there’s no shortage of outdoor concerts and parties, which are also held at nearby Stoneham, Quebec. For your own snowboarding adventures, either stay put at Stoneham, which has 135 hectares (333 acres) of skiable terrain, or drive to nearby Mont-Sainte-Anne. Ideal for black diamond experts and beginners alike, Mont-Sainte-Anne features 71 trails covering 44 miles (71km) on three different sides of the mountain.RBC Canadian Open – Ancaster, Ontario, 3-9 June 2019The Canadian Open is the premier Professional Golfers’ Association tour event in Canada, and is one of the oldest golf tournaments in North America (it dates back to 1904). The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019. The race, which features top cyclists from across Canada, takes competitors through Canada’s “Garden City” and into nearby Metchosin, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. For a cycling experience that’s completely different, head north to the Yukon – the land of the midnight sun. Whitehorse’s 24 Hours of Light Festival, also held in June, is the only 24-hour mountain biking race in the world where lights are illegal riders rely on natural illumination instead.

This late-night horse race – where the horses don’t gallop, but move at a trot, and pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky – begins with the playing of the Island Hymn, followed by the Call to Post at exactly two minutes to midnight. And then, they’re off! If you’re not too exhausted from the previous night’s equestrian fun, there are a number of unique horseback riding opportunities for visitors along PEI’s red beaches and throughout its bucolic countryside. Try Brudenell Riding Stables, located 40 minutes outside Charlottetown on the island’s east coast.Helly Hansen Chester Race Week – Chester, Nova Scotia, August 2019The largest race of its kind in North America, The Helly Hansen Chester Race Week is an exciting, four-day, keelboat regatta that was first officially documented in 1856. Every August, more than 1,200 sailors set off from scenic Mahone Bay to compete in one of 15 fleets racing simultaneously on five different racecourses along the picturesque South Shore of Nova Scotia. Spectators can watch the races from the docks or inside the historic Chester Yacht Club. Once the boats are tied up, the party begins, with live music at the yacht club. For your own Nova Scotia sailing adventure, contact Star Charters in the nearby (and equally quaint) town of Lunenberg. Taking in a Nova Scotia sunset on the Eastern Star, their 48-foot tall ship, is an experience not to be forgotten.2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships – Regina, Saskatchewan, 27 August-1 September 2019Located in the heart of the sunny Saskatchewan capital, Lake Wascana will welcome thousands to the 2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships.

But it may also be remembered as the year people finally took notice of the negative environmental and social effects of an industry that’s been allowed to get out of control. And it’s hard to do this without recalling what happened in June, when we learned that Burberry had been burning £28m worth of its  clothes, accessories and beauty products to safeguard its brand.Insiders already knew that H\u0026ampM was burning excess stock, but to discover that the luxury sector was at it too made many question the industry as a whole. The same month, Mary Creagh, who chairs the Commons environmental audit committee, announced she would be investigating the sustainability of the fashion industry.She said alarm bells were ringing about the fast-growing online-only retail sector against a backdrop of the global ecological emergency. “Low-quality £5 dresses aimed at young people are said to be made by workers on illegally low wages and are discarded almost instantly, causing mountains of non-recycled waste to pile up,” she said. According to a report for the committee, UK shoppers each buy an average of 26.7kg of new clothes every year – more than any other country in Europe.With her panel of cross-party MPs, Creagh questioned experts from brands including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Burberry and Primark, as well as the online retailers Arcadia, Boohoo, Asos and Missguided. The key issues were labour rights, flouting of the minimum wage – in factories in the UK as well as abroad – issues around waste and recycling, overproduction (in March, H\u0026ampM had a stockpile of £3.4bn of unsold goods) and the urgent need to slow down and make clothes that are designed to endure. Creagh accused the industry of “chasing the cheap needle around the world”.So it’s been a year of reckoning for the fashion industry, one in which to take stock of a wasteful, polluting, exploitative business that has been responsible for the doubling of garment production in the past 15 years, to between 80-100bn pieces of clothing a year.However, for brands that are putting social and environmental impact at the heart of their business, 2018 has been a good year. The original organic cotton campaigner Katharine Hamnett relaunched her business in 2017, and in May she said she was fundraising for future expansion, to create a hub for sustainable manufacture in Italy. “The world has caught up with us on the sustainability aspect,” she told the Financial Times. “People have changed their tune – it’s just taken 30 years to happen.”The Californian shoe brand Allbirds launched in the UK in October using a range of low-carbon options including renewable sugar cane soles. And when the Duchess of Sussex wore the Australian zero-exploitation denim brand Outland Denim on her tour in October, the company experienced a rise in sales and interest. Increasingly, the focus seems to be shifting to making new textiles from agricultural waste. One of the winners of this year’s Global Change awards in March was an idea called Crop-A-Porter, which takes the leftovers from the harvest of oil-seed flax, hemp, sugarcane, bananas and pineapples and turns it into a bio-fibre that could be a viable alternative to cotton and provides additional income to farmers. Similarly, Frumat leather, made from apple peel, won the Green Carpet Challenge awards in Milan in September.Which brings us to one of the biggest changes in consumer behaviour in 2018: the rise in veganism. After Gucci announced the death of fur in October 2017, many other labels followed, most recently Chanel, which has also banned exotic skins. London fashion week went fur-free for September (although the anti-fur protesters didn’t seem to have got the memo), while Helsinki fashion week has gone further and banned animal-based leather from 2019.Certainly, Stella McCartney, who launched “vegan Stan Smith trainers” with Adidas in September and has been leading the animal-free fashion charge for more than two decades, will be delighted at the news. In December, the designer was in Poland at COP24 to launch the United Nations fashion industry charter for climate action, with 16 commitments to promote sustainable sourcing, design, and manufacturing.She told the Business of Fashion Voices conference in November: “It’s really about bringing everyone together as an industry, and instead of having a few people talk about it, it’s having everyone talk about it and the leaders ... actually taking responsibility, putting our money where our mouth is and making an amazing change together.” She added: “Everything is at stake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/725f87324aa6e8e05b57b16bcbdc8e152485bae7/32_719_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16cae4a96c2bdae9b771898922bf2a70","title":"at your leisure the best activewear for 2018 in pictures","story":"New year, new you, new goals to run the marathon.

Can she learn to cook an ‘English’?Like many British Asians, I grew up in a household full of the smells of spice, the sound of lamb sizzling and the steady beat of a knife chopping coriander and ginger. Punjabi cuisine takes the highest place in my heart. It’s a reminder of my identity and my family, where food formed a huge part of life. When I cook, often cobbling something together from whatever is lying around, I stop thinking. It’s second nature.Which is great until I receive feedback that my shepherd’s pie has a really odd masala vibe, or that I put the wrong kind of “hot” in hotpot when I added a green chilli. The truth is, I have become dependent on spice. I keep chilli flakes on my desk my spice jar collection is 30-strong. It has become a crutch – I would compare it to someone who slathers every meal with ketchup because they don’t how to create flavour any other way.What I’ve always called English food – although I suppose it’s really British-European – requires a different skill set. I don’t know how to use herbs effectively. Any sauce that involves flour strikes terror in my heart. Then there’s the mystery that is the oven, where you can’t control the heat minute by minute. (Punjabi cooking takes place nearly exclusively in pans on gas hobs, even for the bread.) And what exactly is a jus?It was only four or five years ago that I started getting into English food at all, through cooking shows such as The Great British Menu. On TV, everything looked delicious but also seemed to require spending inordinate amounts of money on dozens of ingredients. Then there was the time and skill needed. “It takes me 20 minutes just to get some clean pans together if my flatmates have been in,” I would think. “I have no chance.” Where English food was concerned I resigned myself to being an eater rather than a maker. It was like my relationship with Love Island: by the time I realised quite how excellent it was, it was too late for me to catch up.But last month it was decided that the hallowed New Year’s Day lunch – a tradition in my circle of Brits, Americans and Aussies – was to fall to me. It was time to face my culinary demons and finally add an English into my repertoire. And what could be a better foundation than a roast dinner?To guide me, I enlisted Hannah McCollum, 28, the founder of artisanal-hummus brand ChicP and a private chef. There are a few reasons. First, her sustainable, waste-not approach resonates with my own love of “make-do” cooking. She trained at the Grange, a cookery school in Somerset that had “a very eco and natural approach. You’d be cooking with produce you’d seen grow,” she says.Second, her work as a private chef has been mostly for families who hire her to cater holidays or events, so her focus on food is domestic rather than commercial. It was working for these clients that turned her on to dips: “At the end of each day I would blend whatever we had left over for the next day’s dips,” she recalls. “It became my signature.”Third, she’s about the same age as me, so hopefully she won’t be judging me for my tiny, shared kitchen, which doesn’t have a functioning grill, yet somehow has accrued 12 novelty shot glasses.Over the course of our sessions, Hannah will guide me to create an extensive roast, including crisp taters, cauliflower cheese, roasted roots, bread sauce, braised cabbage, a red wine gravy and, of course, a meaty pièce de résistance. Along the way, I hope to master time management, learn how to make sauces and get a better handle on herbs.We decide that for our roast we’re going to use game – meat from animals that have been hunted rather than farmed, such as venison, rabbit, wild duck, pheasant and pigeon. “Game should be at the top of every sustainable meat-eater’s list,” Hannah says. Hunting may seem cruel, but no more so than a lot of meat production. And it is kinder to the environment than turning wild land into farmland.We opt for pheasant, which Hannah tells me is a versatile meat that you “can do all kinds with, from pheasant bolognese to paté”. It’s quick to cook and no more expensive than organic chicken. Plus, pheasant sounds like something that would be served up for Henry VIII. What could be more impressive than that?We start by stuffing the bird with onion and rosemary, and frying it off in some butter. We will then roast it on top of some carrots that I’ve chopped but haven’t peeled. “I don’t see why you’d remove the skin,” Hannah says. “It’s quicker, healthier and avoids waste.” We won’t peel the potatoes either those we will parboil, shake around in flour, add to a baking tray with hot oil and cook in the oven. Hannah is a believer in quick, simple cooking. For our cauli cheese there’s no parboiling, just white sauce (butter, flour, milk) added straight on to the veg then whacked into the oven with a bit of cheese on top. “You can roast anything if you have time,” says Hannah when I complain about stress. “What we’re doing with the hobs is actually a bit more complex. Usually just use what you have in, add oil, season and roast. That’s it.”But for me the lightbulb moment is learning how to create flavour complexities without spice – using vinegar, mustard and raisins, for example, to bring out acidity, heat and sweetness. Special mentions must go to bread sauce, which I had never eaten before, believing it to be some kind of punishing Victorian gruel with no place in modern society (I was wrong – it is delicious), and the simple genius of finishing dishes with nutmeg.And I’m certain that making a roux – the mixture of equal parts flour and fat that forms the basis of many sauces – will be a skill for the rest of my life. The trick is to really get stuck in with your whisk, give it some welly and keep the heat low.It wasn’t even as time-consuming as I imagined: going at full speed, even as a novice, I was able to turn out a pheasant roast dinner in less than two hours. I’m not sure if this is good or bad. I had hoped that roasting would be a more social activity, where I could pop out of the kitchen every so often and relax with friends and family. Instead, I’m working flat out.Still, I haven’t stopped roasting since. I’m a roasting fiend. My fridge looks like a morgue for birds. Chickens, pigeons, partridges: their carcasses line the shelves to be picked clean by my flatmates before heading into a stock. Forget spice: my new craving is for the impressed faces of my colleagues when I mention my lunch of grouse sandwiches. It’s all still very new to me, but I am hoping it will lead to a life-long relationship. I just wish someone had warned me about the amount of washing up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f26e43cdc7055b2587cb3d11f8166f8fce7711/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301a89b47a85081733b0ef3a436f228e","title":"how to get better at healthy eating shake up your shopping and start cooking","story":"Forget the takeaways, the meals out – and all those overambitious cookbooksThe simplest way to improve your diet and eat more healthily isn’t counting calories, “eating a rainbow”, buying low-fat everything or following any other of the tired, ineffective mantras that are trotted out. In practical terms, the surest way to eat better is cooking most of your food at home or, failing that, talking some other nice person into doing it for you. The more you eat out or rely on convenience food, the more the balance of your diet will go the wrong way. The more food you eat that isn’t homemade, the poorer your diet is likely to be in terms of nutrition and the quality and provenance of its ingredients. If you base your meals on mainly unprocessed or minimally processed ingredients, and cook more often than not, you won’t go far wrong.Motivate yourself for more hands-on activity in the kitchen by calculating how much money you’ll save. It’s easy to spend £20 a week on barely satisfying sandwich-based lunches. The most basic, most functional restaurant meals or takeaways will make an even greater dent in your finances. Kick the habit of reaching for the phone or dropping into the takeaway when you’re hungry and head for the kitchen instead. You’ll free up more money than smokers do when they give up fags.Shake up your shopping habits. Don’t leave thinking about meals to the last minute. Most of all, avoid ending up in the corner supermarket after work, desperately looking for something that you can eat asap. Smaller supermarkets that cater for the lunchtime and post-work trade stock even more junky snacks and assorted products to be avoided than their bigger equivalents. And they offer a stultifying choice that doesn’t change 365 days of the year, which kills the urge to cook. Make a slot for food shopping, and get yourself down to interesting small shops, markets or anywhere the seasons are reflected in what’s on offer and the food isn’t smothered in antiseptic plastic. These environments will make you want to eat, and ideas of what to cook will smack you between the eyes. If you can’t make it to stimulating shops, get a box of high-quality ingredients delivered to your home or work and let the contents inspire you.Initially, because it takes momentum to get into the routine of food preparation, don’t try to cook things you haven’t made before. Forget those dishes you meant to try but never got round to – that approach courts lethargy and self-delusion. Instead, revisit the old favourite recipes in your comfort zone, and remind yourself how much better they are than most of what you could buy eating out. Once you have got into a rhythm, start tackling recipes you have eyed up from afar. You might actually make some of them now.Cookbooks are great, but less is more, especially if you are one of those people who’s better at buying them than cooking from them. Focus on one favourite book that is well within your skill set, one with short ingredient lists, and cook the easiest dishes you can find in it. Once you’re in the swing of regular meal preparation, then, and only then, add new techniques and cuisines – fermentation, sourdough bread baking, Kazakh cookery et al – to your core competencies. Never believe that watching TV cookery programmes is more likely to make you cook. Empirical observation of UK eating habits suggests that the opposite is the case.Instead of trying to cook every day, most fatally in the early evening when you are already knackered, have a major once-a-week cooking session, probably at the weekend, that will break the back of your food preparation burden. Hero dishes here include soups, stews, casseroles, gratins, hefty salads, curries – anything that can be reheated or eaten cold, and served again for packed lunch or dinner in the week. Think in terms of a rolling programme. Last night’s spinach and potato curry becomes tomorrow’s side veg with sausages. Leftover roasted veg, with a bit of cheese crumbled on top, becomes the next day’s workplace salad lunch. Cook once, then eat twice or thrice. Make your dishes in bulk, freeze what’s left, and build up a store of homemade food for days when cooking seems too hard.Don’t let appetite-crushing “healthy eating” guidelines and assorted food scares overrule your good sense about what to eat, or spoil your enjoyment of food. Base your diet around sound ingredients, studiously ignore fads, and reserve a healthy scepticism for everything from top-down government health orthodoxy to the latest trendy diet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ee2accaf9ecdca82573b1d605eee39c65ba219/359_707_7663_4599/master/7663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3556d3e8d5e733dbe7d6265cdf6c1b5","title":"rachel roddy recipe italian chestnut pudding monte bianco new year dessert","story":"A traditional Italian dessert, the monte bianco is a mountain of chestnut puree topped with a snowy peak of creamIn La Torricella are three cabinets with domed glass covers. The first contains fish, which changes daily, but almost always includes a scowling monkfish, shoals of anchovies and scarlet prawns. The second has an excavated round of pecorino cheese and the day’s vegetables, which in December means artichokes and leafy greens in all their plainness: chicory, spinach, broccoli, chard. The last is home to a vase of corks, a row of champagnes and a sea of loose fruit: apples, pears, clementines and, filling the gaps, hundreds of castagne, or chestnuts.Like virtually all the trattorie and ristorante owners in Testaccio, Augusto, the owner of La Torricella, originally comes from the neighbouring region of Abruzzo. He still has family and a house near the small village of Santa Lucia, or what’s left of it after the devastating earthquakes in 2009 and 2016. He also has a piece of land that is home to a castagneto, a small, sweet-chestnut wood, that dates back to Roman times.There is nothing Augusto likes more that talking about his castagneto and chestnuts. Like many Abruzzesi, he calls chestnut trees bread trees and chestnuts the bread of the poor, and is all too aware of the vital role they played in the survival of his ancestors. “Chestnuts saved us,” he tells me. A true and quietly obsessional collector, he has spent a lifetime gathering stories, tools and machinery related to harvesting his crop of prickly cupules containing smooth and shiny treasure. Pietro, the most unreadable of the three waiters, is also Abruzzese and he too has his own castagneto. Between them, at chestnut time, they fill the cabinet with small, mahogany nuts.Most of the nuts in the third cabinet are for caldarroste, which means hot roast, the same you find on the dodgy stalls that dot Rome at this time of year. At La Torricella, most chestnuts are slashed, roasted in the oven, then served as a ritual and sociable pudding, everyone peeling their own and making a right mess on the table. Others become soup along with tiny, cannellini-like fagioli del purgatorio, or a sort of polenta, modern-day versions of the poor dishes that sustained generations. Then there are the riches: Augusto’s chestnut gelato, which reminds me of malted milk biscuits and marrons glacés, chestnuts drowned in brandy and, my favourite among favourites, monte bianco, which, like its namesake Mont Blanc, is a mountain, but of pureed chestnut capped with whipped cream snow.Luxurious it may taste, but making a mound – and there’s no way round this description – of brown, worm-like chestnut puree look beautiful requires skill. In fact, pasticcerie and some restaurants have sophisticated ways of making and presenting monte bianco. Mine is more anthill than Alpine mountain, and requires a food mill or potato ricer. You need 500g peeled chestnuts, which you boil for 20 minutes, then peel with the help of knife – a right palaver. Alternatively, you can score and roast them in a hot oven for 30 minutes, then peel, or simply buy vacuum-packed ones.Serves 6500g peeled chestnutsMilk150g dark chocolate75g icing sugar, plus more for dustingMeringue base (optional)500ml whipping creamPut the peeled chestnuts in a small pan and pour over enough milk to cover them.

Yet Atlético convinced Antoine Griezmann to stay in the face of interest from Barcelona last summer and are attempting to persuade the 22-year-old to follow suit. His €80m release clause would make Hernández the most expensive defender in history, with Bayern having reportedly indicated they are willing to pay it in January. RB Leipzig’s Timo Werner is another target for the German champions as they attempt to recover from their poor start.The 21-year-old’s displays for club and country have ensured Europe’s biggest clubs are on his trail, with Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Bayern Munich the frontrunners as things stand. De Jong’s agent has said that a decision on his client’s future will be made “in the coming weeks” to avoid distractions for the rest of the season, with the midfielder expected to leave Ajax in the summer after they ruled out a January departure. “It’s difficult to say what will happen,” De Jong told the  this month. “I want to finish this season well with Ajax. Then we will see.” But the vultures are circling the Amsterdam Arena for him and the teenage defender Matthijs de Ligt, reportedly valued at more than £100m.The France midfielder was deemed too fat in his youth but has rapidly worked his way up through the lower leagues to become one of the most exciting prospects in his homeland. Lyon have declared he is not for sale in January, although it will probably be a different story in the summer with clubs including Barcelona and Manchester City keeping an eye on him and the emerging star Houssem Aouar. Both impressed during the Champions League group stage matches against City and should be the next big money departures from the Groupama Stadium.Ligue 1’s top scorer has seemingly appeared from nowhere over the last three seasons, having spent his formative years in France’s lower leagues. Usually deployed on the right flank, Pépé has 12 league goals this campaign and has attracted interest from Arsenal among others. Lille have been adamant they will not allow the Ivory Coast international purchased from Angers for around £10m to leave for any less than four times that amount and, with their Champions League qualification hopes still very much alive, it may take a sizeable bid to prise him away in January.The Mexican featured on this list last year and remains highly sought after his winning goal against Germany at the World Cup. But with PSV insisting he will not leave unless they receive a bid of £40m, Lozano faces the prospect of being priced out of any transfer. Everton are long-term admirers and their sporting director, Marcel Brands, said this week he would be interested for half that valuation, so it remains to be seen whether a deal can be struck. The 23-year-old has not let the speculation worry him, with 11 goals in the Ereisie this season.The Paraguay playmaker has enjoyed another brilliant campaign, leading Atlanta to victory in the MLS Cup and racking up 13 goals and 15 assists in the league as they finished second in the regular season. Having been linked with a move to the Premier League for the past year, Almirón’s time seems to have come, although Atlanta’s president, Darren Eales, has warned his prize asset will not be sold for “chump change”. It is thought he is valued at around £23m, with Newcastle having held talks in recent weeks. West Ham and Tottenham have also been linked with the 24-year-old, who is in contention for the MLS Most Valuable Player award.The Welshman has been in superb form since Arsenal decided to withdraw the new contract they had put on the table and will be free to discuss terms with overseas clubs in January. Juventus and Bayern Munich are rumoured to be interested, although Arsenal may be tempted to cash in should they receive a substantial offer from a Premier League rival. Unai Emery has insisted there is no prospect of reopening talks but could change his mind should Mesut Özil leave.Moses is clearly not part of Maurizio Sarri’s plans, having featured for 28 minutes in the Premier League this season, and Chelsea are willing to let him leave. Having signed a contract until 2021 last year, the Nigeria international is valued at £12m and a return to Selhurst Park appears most likely, with Crystal Palace having registered interest in re-signing a player who came through their academy. Wolves and West Ham have also been linked but the 28-year-old should provide some much-needed support to Wilfried Zaha if he completes an emotional homecoming.The 21-year-old Cameroon left-back has been likened to an express train because of his playing style and, after a rapid rise at Seattle Sounders, he could be on the move, with top-flight clubs in France and Italy having expressed an interest. The Premier League, however, would appear to be the natural fit. He finished his breakout season with the Sounders in 2017 by coming on as a late substitute in the MLS Cup final and progressed further in 2018, making 30 appearances.

Free agent in JulyThe elegant midfielder’s very public spat with PSG’s sporting director, Antero Henrique – the latter insisting Rabiot “will remain on the substitutes’ bench indefinitely” after refusing to sign a new deal – makes his departure inevitable. “What he is doing now is buying his freedom,” said his mother and agent Veronique. “It is firm and definitive. It is impossible to go back.” Barcelona are reported to have a pre-contract agreement in place to sign him in the summer but other suitors including Manchester City – where he spent a few months as a teenager in 2008 – may also be in the mix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201961164a4219e4aae1365035ae94d54b2ec338/1115_167_2613_1567/master/2613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b73482232b0d7bf13cfef21a3ebc7a9f","title":"premier league quick appointment susanna dinnage u turn davie betts","story":"The Premier League is determined to make a swift appointment to fill the vacant role of chief executive after the surprise decision by Susanna Dinnage to walk away from the job.That leaves the broadcast executives Tim Davie and Tom Betts, the two candidates understood to have been on the original shortlist with Dinnage, as the most likely candidates. Davie runs BBC Studios while Betts is ITV’s director of strategy.Dinnage accepted the task of succeeding Richard Scudamore in November but changed her mind over the Christmas period and has opted to stay at the media company Discovery, where she is the global president of Animal Planet.The Premier League has an interim CEO in place, Claudia Arney, after Scudamore vacated his position last month.

Dinnage’s name was a surprise, meanwhile, with some Premier League club owners having reportedly been unaware of her candidacy before being asked to confirm her appointment.The Premier League believes Dinnage’s U-turn was a simple change of heart, with the 51-year-old having decided she preferred not to leave the industry where she has worked throughout her career. She has not commented herself but she would have been taking a job whose main responsibility is to secure ongoing broadcast revenue for the league at a time of structural uncertainty and with most of the current deals having only recently been tied up.Domestic TV rights have been shared between Sky and BT Sport until the end of the 2021-22 season, with Amazon also entering the fray with the rights to two complete ‘match days’.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3f1131f4c7c250b27fb2ac7c09c13ffdb9e1e37/0_124_593_356/master/593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f52cdd3854a42a5afc8dd56df2a10d2c","title":"a new start lou sanders on the moment a friend called out her negativity","story":"A few home truths helped save the standup from a lifetime of miseryI was in my mid-20s and living in a house I shared with some old friends and new mice. One night, I was waffling on about something trivial, but giving it great weight. My best friend, Jules, looked at me with pity and disdain and said: “Lou, I can’t bear to be around you, you’re just so negative.”Best thing she ever said! The finality, the rawness, the reality – she saved me from my own silly self. I didn’t know it at the time, of course – too negative to see it, I suppose.Like a lot of kids, when I was really young, I was overjoyed with life. Dancing, prancing and mucking about. Shoving Lego up my bum with a smile on my face. Five-year-olds have the right idea (not so much about the Lego that’s a waste of a good toy). But young kids have life sorted. Not a lot holds them back. You want a song? They will sing it. You want someone to live in the moment? They’re on it – although they can’t tell the time.I was relentlessly positive. I was enchanted by life and very grateful. I had watched enough Blue Peter appeals to know that running water was a luxury, thank you, and I was more than happy to explain this to everyone I knew. I would jump around exclaiming: “We’re so lucky – looky here – water out of the tap! They haven’t got that in Africa.” Yes, sure, colonially patronising and geographically ignorant, but it was a different time.I would leave loving thank-you letters for my mum, brother, stepdad and cat – and the last three in that mix didn’t even particularly like me at the time – but looking back now I can sort of see why. I had the persona of a Californian orcee who has rebuilt their life and runs a course called “An attitude of gratitude with a side of sass”.But, bit by bit, life chips away at you. It happens to most people: you are told it’s not just a game, you take on responsibility, you weather knockbacks, you are told ice-cream is not a meal. You grow up and get real. Life, it turns out, is not what you thought it would be.By the time I was 25, I was a full-on neg head – and not in a funny way, either. I have friends who bemoan everything and it is hilarious: they’re great value – they are funny! The difference is they’re not looking to others to fix them, they are not sucking people’s energy. In fact, they get a twisted pleasure from deriding everything and the way they do it is paradoxically joyous, because they are having fun.But true vibe-killers, like I was – there is nothing funny about them. And they make life harder for themselves, because, to some degree, you get what you expect. This has been proved by social scientists such as Richard Wiseman and social idiots like my friend Unlucky Barry.When I was 25, it was not like I was in a war zone or a hospice. I had a colourful backstory, but lots of people had it way worse. The main thing in my way was my own goddamn attitude. So Jules’s wake-up call was a gift. It forced me to get positive. This did not happen overnight, but – bit by bit, month by month, year by year – I did it. I devoured self-improvement books, I watched Eckhart Tolle on YouTube, I observed other people and questioned how they approached life. I was committed to resetting myself to be more joyful and, as I became better at it, my life became better.Is this true, or did I just view my life more optimistically? Who cares – the result is the same. Externally, things did improve and I was more fun to be around. I know some people will roll their eyes at this – it sounds so millennial, so navel-gazing, so self-obsessed and privileged. Maybe, given the state of the world now, it seems fluffy, light, insidious and irresponsible even to see some of the suffering and say: “Smile, it’ll be all right!” But that is not what I am saying – lots of things won’t be all right and lots of things will. That’s why you have to enjoy the good bits and not wait for the bad. When the sun is shining, enjoy the sun when the rain is raining, dance in the rain – you’re going to get wet anyway. And if you slip and injure your back, at least you get some time to relax in hospital.Lou Sanders: Shame Pig is touring from 16 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fccea53f52cca9f8574a5a90b49c5719e48bdfa/0_612_3343_2006/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab4377192e13f1ce96c4c99df1d65b8","title":"a new start the best photographs to usher in 2019","story":"Tomorrow is a new year, but fresh starts don’t obey the calendar. Here, six photographers reflect on a time when life shifted on its axis. Selected by Sarah GilbertThe Farc fought a guerrilla campaign in Colombia that lasted for 53 years. Almost half of the fighters were women, but they were forbidden from getting pregnant – those who did had abortions in the jungle or were forced to abandon their children. As soon as the peace deal was signed, in November 2016, Farc women began getting pregnant. I thought that symbolised the transition from war to peace. Olga, in this picture, was one of the first women to become pregnant. She had lived on the street since the age of seven and joined the Farc when she was 11. She had known only war for more than 20 years. A year after this was taken, I returned to Colombia. The camp was so different – there were lines of houses, no weapons, people were being reunited with their families. Olga had traced her brother – apparently he had been working for the military, chasing down the Farc. Now they live nearby, in peace. As told to Tim JonzeI had been napping in the back of my friend’s car when this happened. We were in Mexicali, Mexico, waiting to cross back into the US. A disturbance woke me up – I looked through the windshield and saw three men, one of whom grabbed a ladder. He held it while the other two climbed up and shimmied down the US side on a yellow nylon rope. The picture was taken on instinct – luckily, I woke up with the camera lying beside my head. I only got two or three frames before they were gone. Scaling this fence is a massive step into the unknown – from the moment their feet hit the ground, these men are entering a world of virtually enforced anonymity. It can be disheartening, filled with injustices. But, for them, it seemed worth the risk. As told to Tim JonzeBefore embarking on this project, I was in a really low place. My father had died unexpectedly, I had suffered two serious injuries and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami had devastated my country. I felt hopeless, until my late father came to me in a dream: “Go to this village hidden in deep snow where I lived a long time ago,” he whispered. I decided to take a train there. When I arrived, an ancient shrine ritual called zaido, dating from the Nara period (AD710 to AD794), was being performed. This picture shows a child drinking water from a chōzuya. Zaido is performed on the second day of the new year in order to call upon happiness for the coming 12 months. Taking the photographs represented a fresh start for my life, too. The love and dedication of the people who had preserved this sacred festival throughout its 1,300-year history, overcoming hardships such as earthquakes and war, gave me the courage to live life to the fullest again. As told to Tim JonzeI was taking photos for the annual calendar of the Italian navy, but I wanted to carry on doing reportage at the same time, focusing on immigration. I was on board a frigate for about a fortnight and it picked up 400 to 500 refugees in the Mediterranean. Some were fleeing war, including many Syrians some were from Africa. This man had arrived from Libya after crossing the Sahara, but I don’t know where he started. I never had a chance to talk to him. He was resting on the roof of the frigate under his thermal covering, along with all the other men - the women and children were inside. I want to communicate the subject in a positive way, to help make people in government more aware. As told to Phil HoadI was working in El Salvador, covering the civil war in the early 80s after the military government was overthrown. My daily routine was to get up early and drive the roads in every direction until I couldn’t any more. I wasn’t looking for anything scripted, I was just photographing the daily life around me. I was driving along a highway in the middle of the countryside one day and I saw this wedding. They welcomed me in and I stayed for a couple of hours, taking pictures. I didn’t know much about the couple and I wouldn’t be able to find them again, but this intimate scene felt like an oasis of hope among the violence. I see it as a sombre moment because of what was happening in the country, but it also represents how life moves on despite terrible crises. You never know where it will lead you. As told to Ammar KaliaI was trying to figure out what kind of photographer I wanted to be. I realised that the most personal thing about me was that I hadn’t told my parents I was gay. What if I came out to them in a photography project? The idea seemed too crazy, but it kept haunting me. I realised I had to be sensitive to my parents – I couldn’t be like: “Hi, I’m gay,” and shove a camera in their face. So, I spent three weeks photographing them from the moment they woke until they went to sleep. By the time we had this conversation, they were at ease with cameras being everywhere. After I told them, I burst into tears. Then everyone else did. My parents threw their arms around me and said: “It’s OK, we love you.” It felt like a before and after moment, not only in my personal life, but also as a photographer – the project gave me the confidence to become the artist I wanted to be.

With vegan options becoming cheaper, and more widespread and convenient, organisers of the initiative believe 2019 will be the year of the vegan.Since the movement started five years ago, participant numbers have more than doubled each year and a total of more than 250,000 people in 193 countries have signed up. Rich Hardy, head of campaigns at Veganuary, said that on Sunday alone 14,000 people pledged to go vegan for the first month of 2019 – a rate of one every six seconds. “In 2018 there hasn’t been a week that has gone by without veganism hitting the headlines, whether it is a magazine editor being fired or Waitrose launching a new range of products,” Hardy said. “Vegan products are getting a lot better and it is becoming a lot more convenient to have a tasty plant-based diet.”He suggested stark warnings from scientists about the environmental cost of meat had persuaded many people who would not previously have considered veganism to give it a try.In May, scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet declared that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest thing an inidual could do for the environment.Joseph Poore, of Oxford University, who led the research, said: “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth – not just greenhouse gases but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use. It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car.”Chris Packham is among the celebrities to sign up to this year’s Veganuary, while the Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns and Green party peer Jenny Jones have joined the ranks and the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, a committed vegan, has called on other parliamentarians to take the pledge.Many regard 2018 as the year that veganism moved out of the realms of counter-culture and into the mainstream. Hardy said that while vegans and veganism were sometimes portrayed as judgmental and exclusive, movements like Veganuary aimed to be as fun and inclusive as possible.Like all New Year resolutions, sticking to veganism can be tricky, but Hardy urged those who try it not to worry unduly. “If you fall off the wagon, you fall off the wagon,” he said. “Just pick yourself up, remind yourself why you signed up to the pledge in the first place and start afresh. It is meant to be fun and enjoyable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d272b80e3d728e8f8989318fc012fee6831ed98d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa9ab1115183e9065c612528052d4c44","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2019 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us cover Last year we published a piece detailing readers’ hopes for 2018’s  coverage, from continuing the fight against fossil fuel disinvestment to “making space for all things vegan”.We now want to hear what you would like us to report on in 2019.

It had been scheduled for December, but the prime minister postponed it at the last minute, amid near-unanimous expectations that she would lose heavily.She delayed the vote to placate MPs by seeking what Downing Street calls “legal and political assurances” over the deal, notably on the backstop arrangement for the Irish border.The backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in elements of the single market and customs union if no permanent trade arrangement is reached to avoid a hard Irish border, is heavily disliked by May’s DUP allies, as well as by a number of Brexit-backing Conservative MPs.They are concerned that the UK would not be able unilaterally to pull out of the arrangement, something on which the EU is refusing to budge. May has hoped to gain assurances that the backstop is unlikely to come into force.The Christmas talks had not yet led to a solution, May’s spokeswoman said: “There’s still more work to do. The PM is absolutely focused on doing that in the lead-up to the vote itself. The UK team, at official level, are in contact with their counterparts in the EU technical level. Her focus is on getting the assurances MPs want ahead of that vote taking place.”Asked if the prime minister was confident of success, given the resumption of the Commons debate begins in little more than a week, the spokeswoman said: “That is what she is focused on, yes.”Parliament returns on 7 January, and May will hope to persuade the DUP and potential Tory rebels to back her plan, arguing that if her plan is blocked, Brexit might not happen.One leading Conservative malcontent, John Redwood, was knighted in the New Year honours list, prompting accusations of desperate tactics by No 10. He has since said it will make no difference to his vote.Downing Street has also sought to exert pressure on remain-leaning MPs by insisting that a no-deal departure is the alternative to her proposal, and ramping up contingency planning for this.This has included spending more than £100m to charter ferries to ease “severe congestion” at Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It has emerged that one of the companies contracted, Seaborne Freight, does not own any ships, has not previously operated a ferry service and is not planning to do so until late March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0399cfe23c1539c727b617a531aa3c3f2f8c7403/92_0_2816_1691/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=829941e99c49ea24b80c06accbf66c30","title":"can you solve it 2019 in numbers","story":"Calculations to kick-start the new yearUPDATE: To read the solutions click here.To welcome the New Year, we’re going to celebrate the number 2019. Here’s one numerical factoid readers may find charming:Thanks Ed! Please add your pleasing 2019 number patterns in the comments below. Meanwhile, today’s puzzles:(i) Using only the digits 2, 0, 1 and 9, create expressions that equal all of the numbers from 0 to 12. The expressions can include any of the arithmetical symbols +, –, x, ÷ and √, and brackets.I’ll start you off:Note: you must use each of the digits 2, 0, 1 and 9 once and only once in each expression.(ii) Create expressions using 2, 0, 1 and 9 for all the numbers from 13 to 20. Again each number must be used once and only once in each expression, but as well as the operators mentioned above you can now use concatenation (meaning you can join numbers up, for example, a 2 and a 0 can concatenate to 20) and exponentiation (meaning that one number can be the power of another, such as 19).(iii) How much higher can you go with just 2,0, 1 and 9? What other mathematical symbols do you need to create expressions all the way to 100?Fill the blanks in the following equation, so that it makes arithmetical sense:You are allowed to use any of the basic mathematical operations, +, –, x, ÷, and as many brackets as you like. An answer might look something like (10 – 9 + 8) x (7 – 6 – 5)(4 + 3 + 2 + 1)  2019, but not this one since the equation is incorrect.There are many solutions. I’ll give a copy of my puzzle book Puzzle Ninja to the one I like the best. You can either tweet me or email me your solutions.The countdown conundrum is an annual tradition in this column. With some trial and error you will hopefully find a solution. What better way to end 2018 with a sense that you have already conquered 2019!

The Rugby Football Union insists it can act only on a complaint made directly to it, although that has not been the case in past charges of bringing the game into disrepute, such as the one involving the Gloucester fly-half Danny Cipriani earlier this year. Peters said he would not be making a complaint for family reasons and because he is uncomfortable, as a journalist, about becoming the story. He argues that given the evidence that exists and past cases, including coaches who have criticised referees in their post-match interviews, disciplinary action should not come down to him while Gloucester are also said to have received a number of complaints from supporters about the language coming from Sale’s coaching area in the stand during the game.Just as Diamond, whose club on Monday announced their South Africa scrum-half Faf de Klerk had signed a contract extension to keep him at the club until the summer of 2023, will not have the bother of having to answer to a disciplinary panel so there were no citings from the bad-tempered Big Game 11 at Twickenham between Harlequins and Wasps last Saturday.Harlequins suspended their hooker, Dave Ward, for one match for stamping on Thomas Young but he will not have to answer to an allegation, which he denied, that he spat at the Wasps flanker, after the citing officer Buster White concluded that the video evidence did not justify a charge.Harlequins felt the Wasps wing Josh Bassett should have been called for dangerous play when he took evasive action after failing to beat Mike Brown to a high ball and got in the way of the England full-back, who landed on his head and shoulders, as he made his descent, but it was ruled not to merit a red card."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d4c0e8f4716d301992c825f970cd1a45208e9dd/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15d186572acaa0d7289c5f8cc3d1234","title":"the sporting quotes of 2018 year","story":"From Australia’s sandpaper storm to some impressive popularity contests, via José Mourinho and worm denial5 January: “We have money for sardines and I’m thinking lobster.

For the image speaks so volubly of his continuing industry: the swatches of fabric behind his desk the drawer beneath it, full to bursting with ribbons and buttons above all, the master’s intense, almost dreamy concentration as he contemplates the bolt of red silk wrapped so pleasingly around Daouphars’s tiny frame.By this point, of course, Coco Chanel, who regarded Dior’s designs as an affront to liberated women, was snapping at his heels she launched her trademark suit in 1954. But why would he have cared? His influence, then as now, could not have been overstated. In February 1947, at 30 Avenue Montaigne, Dior had unveiled what would come to be known as the New Look (a phrase coined by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar). Overnight, its full skirts and nipped-in waists redefined women’s silhouettes it would go on to revitalise the Paris fashion industry. In Britain, Dior’s clients included Margot Fonteyn and Nancy Mitford the gown worn by Princess Margaret when she was photographed by Cecil Beaton to mark her 21st birthday was by Dior.In February, the V\u0026ampA will open the biggest exhibition ever staged in the UK on the house of Dior. It will trace the couturier’s influence, as well as that of the six designers who went on to succeed him at the fashion house, and it will look, too, at his love affair with Britain (he found tweeds so fetching – though it’s possible he was just being polite). Above all, it will (I hope) capture the excitement felt by war-weary women across Europe as they realised hemlines were set to drop – and drop. “My skirts are a release,” Dior insisted, and in a way, he was right. However cumbersome, they were also a sign that life, having been so hard for so long, was about to get a little better.Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams is at the V\u0026ampA, London, from 2 February-14 July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17bb688d9f0c01a28c20f42811ae7a8faab0861e/0_203_5740_3444/master/5740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6866171122a03f20183bc5528c30c02f","title":"les miserables review merci andrew davies cest magnifique","story":"Liberally scattered with talent from Dominic West and David Oyelowo to Lily Collins, this mercifully song-free adaptation was a rich feast to end the yearAndrew Davies’s six-part adaptation of Victor Hugo’s classic novel Les Misérables (BBC One) begins with an explanatory caption. “After 20 years of war, France is defeated and Napoleon is exiled. A new king is waiting to be crowned. The old order is to be restored. The revolution is to be forgotten. And there are no songs.”It didn’t really say that last bit. But it could have, because the USP of this version is that it is not the musical that long ago usurped the novel as What We Mean When We Talk About Les Misérables. “Boo!” shouts the half of the country that also likes fancy-dress parties, board games and other terrible, terrible things. “Hurrah!” shout the rest of us.Even the refuseniks would surely have been rewarded. Starring Dominic West as a toweringly furious Jean Valjean, David Oyelowo as his remorseless nemesis Javert and Lily Collins – who pulls off the feat of making Fantine heartbreakingly naive rather than goppingly stupid – and liberally scattered with further talent (Emma Fielding, for example, was glimpsed as the infant Marius Pontmercy’s nurse), last night’s opening episode was a groaning table of treats – a rich feast with which to end the year and see us into the next. And, while I know it is not the done thing to refer to a person’s age when it is strictly speaking an irrelevance to the task at hand, could we take a moment to tip our hats to Davies who, two years after his War and Peace was broadcast, delivers this unto us, at the age of 82? If Attenborough gets kudos for voicing new nature programmes, we should be able to acknowledge this admiringly, too.The first episode covered the last year of Valjean’s 19-year sentence breaking rocks in the Toulon penal colony. There is no commutation when he saves the life of a guard crushed by a rockfall (albeit one that Valjean, creature of instinct that he is, caused when the guard enraged him). Rather, as even those of us who have never read the book or seen the musical but have absorbed the story by osmosis will know, the strength he displays in the rescue is only going to come back and bite him on his exceptionally well-muscled bum later. On his eventual release, Javert points out, with no small measure of satisfaction, that the next crime he commits, however minor, will put him back there for life. “You can never win.” Valjean may see battle lines drawn. Viewers see a net beginning to be lightly drawn around the whole.Meanwhile, the young grisette Fantine and her friends have become enmeshed with a trio of posh boys who promise them the world – gold necklaces, fine clothes, £350m extra a week for the NHS – then bugger off home when they have had enough, careless of the grief, destruction and, in the case of Fantine’s Felix, the daughter they leave behind. Her friends had tried to warn her. “The ground we walk on isn’t solid ground,” says Favourite. “Maybe it isn’t always like that,” says Fantine with the hope that will doom her. “Yes it is,” Favourite says, brutally, accurately. “It is always like that.”Valjean’s new papers mark him as an ex-convict. He is cheated of pay and is offered shelter, kindness and a chance at redemption by Monseigneur Myriel (Derek Jacobi) before the bitterness at the unfairness of his life consumes him. Valjean – as again, somehow we all know – steals the silverware instead. He is brought back, and Myriel (and coming from a Catholic family, let me tell you this is something we left-footers excel at) heaps coals of fire on his head by pretending to the gendarmes that he gave Valjean the silverware and pressing some silver candlesticks on him before he leaves again.As Fantine stares out the window of the flat that I doubt Felix has even paid for till the end of the month, holding Cosette and wondering quite what her options are as a young, penniless working-class woman on the streets of 19th-century Paris, Valjean is still struggling with his baser instincts. When a young boy passes him on the road, Valjean steals the 40-sou coin he is carrying. The boy runs off. Valjean repents. A new set of narrative engines fire up, and next week we shall be firmly in the thick of things.C’est magnifique – and there is no chance of Russell Crowe popping up to sing about stars or runaway carts.

But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact “megaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals”.Macron said this hatefulness was “the negation of France” and that “our future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation.” He said he had “seen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable” in recent weeks and that “order” in France would be maintained.Macron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for new year’s celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protestrs.About 300,000 tourists and revellers were expected on the Champs Élysées on New Year’s Eve for Paris’s annual light show, which is projected on to the Arc de Triomphe and was the target of protesters this month. A security cordon was set up around the area from 4pm and security guards and police checked those who entered. Some gilets jaunes demonstrators called for peaceful protests in Paris.Over the past decade, hundreds of cars have been set alight on the edge of French cities including Strasbourg and Lyon on New Year’s Eve in what has become a kind of end-of-year ritual. But officials said security services were on alert for unannounced anti-government protests in order to prevent violence.The gilets jaunes movement, named after protesters’ hi-vis vests, began in November as a tax revolt against a new fuel duty. It has morphed into a nationwide protest against what has been seen as an unfair and unjust tax policy, and Macron’s measures favouring businesses and the wealthy. Rioting, arson and running battles with police have occurred on the edge of demonstrations in Paris and other cities.In his new year speech, Macron acknowledged the anger that had spread across France and tried to empathise. But he said it had been brewing for a long time – implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation.Macron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it “showed us that we’re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future”.He was careful to use the words “us” and “we” to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated  a desk in a gilded room, this time Macron stood up in a more modern room in the Élysée Palace.After some in Macron’s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits.He said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: “The results can’t be immediate, and impatience – which I share – can’t justify any kind of giving up.” He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless “ultra free-market” capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a Europe that “protects”.Macron said one of his key wishes for 2019 was “truth”, including a fight against inaccurate information online. This suggested that Macron might seek to go further on regulating information line, after his government passed a law which aims to empower judges to order the immediate removal of news deemed as fake during election campaigns. He did not give details.Gilets jaunes demonstrators have called for referendums and a greater role for citizens in everyday politics. Macron said “our institutions must continue to evolve” but didn’t spell out any possible changes to the political system. He has promised to launch a national debate from January and said only that he would write to citizens to set out the parameters in coming days.The European elections in May will be a major test for Macron’s political party, La République En Marche, which is behind Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally in the polls. Macron said in his speech that he would soon set out a project for Europe.He is also again under pressure over the scandal of his former bodyguard and security aide, Alexandre Benalla, who was sacked this summer after he was filmed acting violently to demonstrators.The Benalla affair was back in the headlines this week over the former aide’s continuing use of diplomatic passports. He also claimed he had remained in personal contact with Macron. The affair has proved damaging in part because of the Elysée’s botched handling of it, making statements that were contradicted and giving the impression of a cover-up. The Elysée on Monday dismissed his claims as invented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c596065dc861e53339e10d1cedcc020a4037c/0_203_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f81f9e0468baabbe9b435c3537349f9","title":"new discoveries at pompeii come amid renaissance at site","story":"Man who died fleeing Mount Vesuvius eruption is one of several key finds in latest digTeresa Virtuoso is more than used to digging up tombs. But when the archaeologist found the skeleton of a man who died while trying to escape the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79, she couldn’t help but think about his final moments.“At that moment, it wasn’t only about doing a job,” Virtuoso, who is coordinating excavations in part of Regio V, an entire quarter of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii that is yet to open to the public, told the .“It made me think about the eruption and how afraid this man must have been as he ran. He was also found in an area that suffered most of Vesuvius’s damage it would have been impossible to survive.”He was the first victim to be found during excavations of Regio V, a 21.8-hectare (54-acre) site to the north of the archaeological park. The dig is the most intensive since the 1960s and symbolises a renaissance at the site, which earlier this decade was overcrowded and in parts crumbling.Surprises unearthed so far this year include the remains of a horse a home with an elaborate shrine well-preserved mosaics and a bedroom fresco depicting an erotic scene from the Greek myth Leda and the Swan.The discovery of the remains in May was even more startling as it appeared that the man had survived the initial phase of the eruption when the city was blanketed in volcanic ash and pumice. His torso was protruding from a large stone block but rather than being decapitated by it (the first appearance of his image online led some to call him history’s unluckiest man) archaeologist believe he was killed by the lethal gases of the eruption’s later stages.The victim, believed to have been in his mid-30s, was also found with a small sack of 20 silver and two bronze coins, the equivalent of about €500 (£450) in today’s money.Virtuouso said he probably took refuge in his home in the hours after the initial eruption, leaving only when he thought it was over. Experts established that he suffered from a physical defect that caused him to limp, thus hampering his escape from the doomed city.In late October, the skeletons of two women and three children were discovered huddled together in the room of a villa in Regio V. A week earlier, the same villa revealed a charcoal inscription that suggested Vesuvius erupted in October AD79, and not in August of that year as previously thought. Many of the homes uncovered had been damaged by a massive earthquake in Pompeii in AD62, but people continued to live in them, according to Francesco Muscolino, the archaeologist leading the excavations.Various scrawls have also been found – including one believed to have been done by a child and spelling out “Sabinus”, the surname of an esteemed family of ancient Pompeii.The city, which attracts almost 4 million visitors a year, has come a long way since 2013, when Unesco threatened to place it on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation.The threat followed several incidents over the previous years, including the collapse of the House of Gladiators and a number of walls. Other shortcomings included a lack of qualified staff, structural damage and vandalism. Wide-ranging preservation works have taken place since then, while homes and alleys that were previously closed have been reopened, alleviating pressure on tourist congestion in popular areas.Authorities have also discussed a new evacuation plan in case Mount Vesuvius erupts again.For Massimo Osanna, the park’s superintendent, the biggest challenge is ensuring that the higher management standard is maintained.“It doesn’t take much to slip backwards,” he said. “Previously there was a problem with supervision, but we need to be constantly monitoring.”Part of that monitoring entails trying to educate people to respect the site.“We had an issue with French schools organising treasure hunts, so children would be running around, touching frescoes and everything else,” added Osanna.“Then you get those who climb on top of pillars to take selfies – it makes me so angry. The problem is stupidity, not understanding how fragile and unique Pompeii is.”Tourists stealing artefacts is less of an issue nowadays after a museum displaying relics returned by repentant thieves was created. Park officials have received many letters expressing guilt, with some of the transgressions dating back to the 1980s.The Pompeii ruins were discovered in the 16th century, with the first excavations beginning in 1748. One thousand five hundred of the estimated 2,000 victims have been found over the centuries.Contemporary technology and DNA testing, as well as an interdisciplinary team that includes engineers, geologists, anthropologists and technical experts, helps to not only yield new finds but also shed more light on life in Pompeii before it was destroyed by Vesuvius.With explorations at Regio V continuing into next year, there will no doubt be more to come. Osanna’s favourite discovery so far? “The man with the block on his head, it was astonishing, and the first time we found a victim that was so contextualised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1e1660aa268bf9551351790df2ff5561fe9803e/0_67_3652_2192/master/3652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b34f525d25b61ba7a0fcda2cee4d254","title":"new years eve 2018 celebrations around the world live","story":"Follow all the celebrations as the clock strikes midnight and countries see out 2018 to welcome in 2019More from New York, courtesy of Joanna Walters:Donald Trump is set for an unusually quiet, even lonely, New Year’s Eve in a ided America. The president normally hosts a flamboyant black-tie gala at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. But this year he’s rattling around the White House in Washington, apparently waiting for a deal from Democrats to fund his promised wall on the border with Mexico - a deal that is not forthcoming. The federal government is now in its 10th day of being partially shut down, after Trump refused to back away from his demand for taxpayers’ money for the wall and Congress declined to acquiesce. He tweeted earlier on New Year’s Eve: “I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security, including the wall…”The sound of presidential typing must have echoed off the walls, then rustled through the red, fake Christmas trees, into the political void.Trump is scheduled to do a TV interview on Fox News later in the evening, some time after 10PM local time (3AM GMT), when he is likely once again to try to blame his government shut down on the Democrats - and may possibly speak to his desolate New Year’s Eve at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Revellers can enjoy music across three stages, with Scottish favourite Gerry Cinnamon appearing on the Waverley stage, Judge Jules leading the DJ stage in Castle Street and Elephant Sessions set to take to the stage in South St David Street. At midnight, German band Meute will provide the soundtrack to the fireworks display from Edinburgh Castle while Eurodance outfit Snap! are set to perform on one of the stages in the first minutes of 2019. Meanwhile, Franz Ferdinand - supported by nomy and Free Love - will headline the Concert in the Gardens ahead of midnight at the foot of Castle Rock while some of the country’s top ceilidh bands are to play at Ceilidh under the Castle. First in the queue to see Franz Ferdinand were Jessica Cassino, 37, from Brooklyn, New York, and 28-year-old Alina Entelis, from Israel. “I love Franz Ferdinand. Edinburgh’s beautiful, I love it,” said Cassino. “I’ll be back next year.” Entelis, who is currently studying in London, said: “When I started looking at the Franz Ferdinand concert, I saw a bunch of other events going on. I was participating in the torchlight procession on Sunday and I loved it. “I feel like Edinburgh is the best place to be on New Year’s Eve right now. Everybody is jealous of me back home! I’ve been here once before and I loved it, and I was really looking forward to coming back. I think it’s magical and I’ve recommended it to a bunch of my friends.” The crowd featured first-time visitors, return visitors and those with family links to Scotland. It was the first time in Edinburgh for couple Myriam Malquin, 25, and David Maheo, 26, from Brittany in France. Maheo said: “We wanted to go to a European capital for New Year. We saw that there was a big party in Edinburgh, so we came. It’s great. It’s very interesting to see the castle, all the buildings.” Georgina McGuire, 26, from Woking in Surrey, praised the friendliness of the local residents. “I love Edinburgh - there are good vibes and lots of sparkle. Everyone is so friendly,” she said. Michelle Rossiter, 30, a speech therapist from Sydney, currently working in London, said: “My heritage is from Scotland, my grandmother, that’s why I’m here. “We’ve already met some Scottish people, some Edinburgh locals, and they’re all really friendly. I’m looking forward to the concert. Sydney has some pretty good fireworks, and I am looking forward to fireworks over the castle, but the concert, definitely, is the main thing I’m excited about.” Scotland’s Europe minister Ben Macpherson said: “Edinburgh is one of the world’s best-known cities for bringing in the New Year. Few places celebrate quite like Scotland - the home of the world-renowned Hogmanay celebrations. “Scotland’s ties with our European and international friends and neighbours stretch back many centuries, and this year’s celebrations reflect those ties of friendship, business, culture and commerce - strong ties that the Scottish Government and so many others are determined to see endure, whatever the New Year holds in terms of the Brexit process.”Elsewhere in Scotland, Inverness is hosting Scotland’s biggest free Hogmanay celebration while celebrations are also taking place in centres such as Aberdeen and Stirling.

Casual sandwich chain Pret a Manger, for example, charges $817 for a table of four. That price gets you hot and cold drinks and some canapes.

He said he hoped this year’s event would “send a message of support” to the more than one million European citizens who call London their home. “Well one of the things which upset many, many Londoners and many people across our country and in Europe is the tone and language used by politicians in Westminster, giving the impression we’re insular, inward looking, not welcoming to Europeans,” he said on New Year’s eve. “I think the Government’s made a mess of negotiations with the European Union. Bearing in mind Parliament can’t resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government.” He vowed that London would remain the same after March 29 2019, adding: “What tonight is about is showing the world, while they’re watching us, that we’re going to carry on being open-minded, outward looking, pluralistic”. Tonight’s about celebrating who we are as a city. We, in my opinion, are one of the greatest cities in the world, one of the reason we are one of the greatest cities in the world is because of the contribution made by Europeans.I think ersity is a strength and I think what tonight is about is celebrating that ersity. I hope that members of Parliament, members of the Government will see the fireworks tonight, will listen to the soundtrack and will reflect on what sort of country they want to live in post-March.The Thames-side display will bring together more than 100,000 spectators to watch the largest annual firework display in Europe, including eight tonnes of fireworks.

Millions watch - crammed on the streets in person, freezing and without toilets, or on TV - a giant crystal, illuminated ball descending down a pole at midnight, high above the heart of New York City.But many places across the US refuse to rely on the New York ball drop and have devised their own versions to mark midnight - but always involving a ‘drop’, according to this CNN report.Idaho, the state most famous for producing spuds, has the New Year’s Eve potato drop. In the state capital, Boise, a giant, glowing fibre glass potato will be lowered on the stroke of 2019.Tallapoosa, in the state of Georgia, celebrates with a ‘possum drop’ - a stuffed possum is lowered inside a ball at midnight.

Photograph: Frank MillerThe Newly-declassified documents have shed new light on Britain’s failed attempts to stop the Clinton administration issuing a visa to allow Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams travel to the United States in January 1994.Adams had been invited to speak at an event hosted by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, which was described by senior Stormont official David Fell as a prestigious body associated with Henry Kissinger.Martinez felt the balance of opinion would be against issuing a visa to the Sinn Féin president. However, he was “a little nervous lest it goes the other way”.Events moved up a key when the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Robin Renwick, informed the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) on January 15th, 1994 that senator Ted Kennedy’s staff had informed him he and three other senators had written to president Bill Clinton arguing that a visa should be granted.The senators were now hearing that there was a split within the IRA and that obtaining a visa to visit the USA might help Adams win support for “his moderate position”.In response, the ambassador told the NIO he had left “Kennedy’s people in no doubt of our views”.“Adams knew that if he and the organisations he represented renounced violence and meant it, they would be welcome to join in the political process.” However, “it was wrong in principle and wrong tactically to reward Adams before he had taken that step”.Downing Street now decided that “the White House needed stiffening against political pressures to grant a visa to Adams on unacceptably soft conditions”.Prime minister John Major’s private secretary Roderic Lyne informed Renwick in Washington that he had made several attempts to contact Tony Lake, Clinton’s national security adviser. “I told Lake’s secretary on the secure telephone that private indications suggested strongly that the Provisionals had decided not to accept the joint declaration as it stood and were deliberately stringing us and the Irish government along in the hope of obtaining concessions – hence their call for ‘clarification’. I added that Sinn Féin was likely to increase the level of violence.“It would surely be embarrassing for the Americans if they let Adams in, only to find IRA violence was increasing.”On January 22nd, Lake phoned Lyne at Downing Street. Lake confirmed that a conditional visa would be granted “if Adams stated publicly that he personally renounced violence and urged all parties to the conflict to do so”, that Sinn Féin and the IRA were prepared “to participate in serious negotiations to end the conflict” and accepted the joint declaration as a basis.Lyne later informed a colleague he told Lake that Adams “would have no difficulty in putting his hand on his heart and declaring that he was a man of peace”. However, Lake replied that the administration was “under heavy domestic pressure” while he felt the British government was not winning the PR battle.In a final push to block the visa, Sir Patrick Mayhew saw the US ambassador to Britain, Ray Seitz, in London on January 25th, 1994.The Northern secretary impressed on the ambassador: “The fact was Adams had to renounce violence. Granting this favour before that would be completely wrong – in NI terms and also dangerous in terms of the USUK relationship.”Mayhew’s intervention failed and, on January 27th, 1994, the NIO learnt the US had decided to issue a 48-hour visa to allow Adams travel to New York.The US ambassador later voiced regret over the decision.In a letter to Mayhew, dated February 2nd 1994, Sir John Chilcot, head of the NIO, disclosed that the “urbane and professional” Seitz “made no attempt to conceal both his chagrin and that of the State Department that his advice had been set aside and, more substantially, at the risk the president’s decision incurred”.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"\u0026lsquoDev must be

Photograph: Eric LukeThe head of the Catholic Church in Ireland Cardinal Cahal Daly expressed concern to UK officials a quarter of a century ago that Gerry Adams had become perceived as “the voice of nationalism”.“This was very far from the truth,” the cardinal said in confidential talks with the Northern Ireland Office on the eve of the IRA ceasefire in 1994, according to newly declassified records.Daly also told then Northern Ireland minister of state, Michael Ancram, that an internal settlement for the North would be “unacceptable”. He said “the Irish dimension was all important . . . and was needed to acknowledge parity in the eyes of those who sought it. Daly also felt that “a Bill of Rights with a strong Irish dimension was essential”.A briefing paper in the files released in Belfast this week profiles the Co Antrim-born primate, who died in 2009. It was suggested that he had had an important role in drafting Pope John Paul II’s speeches during his Irish visit in 1979.The cardinal, the memo noted, “speaks frequently and strongly against IRA violence and had referred to the IRA as a movement ‘alien to Irish traditions and Irish values’.”He was described as “a kindly man” but he had a strong commitment to traditional Catholic values, which had led him to oppose integrated education.On June 1st 1994, Daly met Ancram in Armagh. Daly opened the discussion by saying how pleased he was with the British government’s response to Sinn Féin’s demands for “clarification” of the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993.In Daly’s view, the response “left Sinn FéinIRA without any possible reason (not that there ever was one) to persist with a campaign of violence”. The cardinal said great credit was due to the Ulster Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux in keeping his party together in face of “the tactics deployed by Dr Paisley”. Daly “he was most vexed that Gerry Adams was seen by many as the voice of nationalism – this was very far from the truth”, the memo continued.On the issue of “parity of esteem”, Ancram sought the cardinal’s view as to what this meant. The cardinal stressed that cross-border institutions would have “considerable symbolic importance” for nationalists. Small gestures such as British ministers attending the 1993 GAA final in Dublin had been greatly appreciated by Northern nationalists. The nationalist community also regarded the British government’s Irish language policy as important since Irish “was regarded as a badge of identity by nationalists”.Other files show Cahal Daly expressed concern about a British government decision in 1990 to withdraw funding from the Irish language organisation, Glór na nGael.In a letter in September 1990, Daly wrote: “My regret is that the withdrawal of funding from this group has provided Sinn Féin ... with a propaganda opportunity at a time when their credibility was at a low ebb ...”The bishop had ascertained from local priests that Glór na nGael in west Belfast had taken steps “to purge itself of members or influences ... with Sinn Féin or paramilitary associations”. The organisation, he added, had been founded by Cumann na Sagart, a highly respected organisation of Irish-speaking priests.Daly was joined by the Irish government, various public figures and Protestant devotees of the Irish language in Northern Ireland in protesting against the funding withdrawal.The files reflect a change in the attitude of the British government to Glór na nGael by 1994 as the peace process beckoned. When the organisation’s chair applied for funding for a project officer in July 1994, the official advice was that the organisation should be treated as any other applicant for funding.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744405.1546155479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit juncker tells uk to get your act together","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker attends a news conference earlier this month in Brussels. File photograph: ReutersJean-Claude Juncker has called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” over Brexit, branding some Britons “entirely unreasonable” for expecting Brussels to put forward a solution.The European Commission president also rejected claims of a plot to keep the UK in the EU “by all possible means” and revealed he fears the majority of MPs “deeply distrust” both the EU and Theresa May. Mr Juncker’s comments to German newspaper Welt am Sonntag were published as British cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox said the chances of Britain leaving the European Union will be little more than “50-50” if UK prime minister Theresa May’s deal is rejected by Parliament.Mr Fox, the international trade secretary, warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May’s deal would be “incendiary” and said it was “a matter of honour” for them to support her.MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in the week of January 7th after Mrs May, facing the prospect of a significant defeat, pulled the original date of December 11th.However the bid to buy more time to secure key concessions on the Irish backstop, the key flashpoint for DUP and Brexiteer detractors of the deal, appeared to falter when her fellow leaders refused to change the legal text of the agreement.The PM said talks would continue, although the EU has repeatedly warned negotiations over the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Should MPs reject it when they vote in the coming weeks, it could raise the prospect of no-deal and with it the risk of heavy economic consequences for the UK and EU, or a second referendum on Brexit.Mr Juncker said: “It is not us who are leaving the United Kingdom — it is the United Kingdom that is leaving the European Union.“I find it entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems.“My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want. Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decide if the final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum.However, he said he was “working on the assumption that (the UK) will leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Mr Fox told the Sunday Times that Brexit will only be “100 per cent certain” if the House of Commons backs the prime minister’s deal in a crunch vote next month.Having given the public the right to decide on EU membership in a referendum, “parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on that result”, he said. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Margot, a lowly 12th in 2017, and Matilda are joint top of the girls’ list.Henry rose to top from third last year, possibly on the strength of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle in May.

There are no Meghans - in fact there hasn’t been a Meghan with that spelling since 2001 - and no Kates or Catherines in the top 30. There was a Queen Matilda on the English throne - she was married to King Stephen - but you have to go back almost 900 years.Margot Robbie on the red carpetMore likely Matildas are being named after Roald Dahl’s heroine, now hugely popular in an award-winning musical, while the incidences of Margot is trickier to explain. The Australian actress Margot Robbie, one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, is one possible explanation.Susan Cole, a retired librarian, from Sutton, Surrey, who has been compiling the list for almost 50 years since 1969, said: “Henry now tops the list but Harry doesn’t even make the top ten.

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel.

Bird Box doesn’t take us anywhere we haven’t already been in these other movies.\u0026nbsp“The plotting is sometimes very cumbersome. As the protagonists stumble through forests using fishing line to guide them, you begin to wish they would take off their blindfolds and simply look where they are going. The screenplay never really explains why the evil force (whatever it might be) causes some of those who stare at it to kill themselves while turning others into homicidal psychotics.” also gave the film two stars, criticising it for “clunky punchlines” and its slow-moving pace, along with a cast that feels “as curated as a box of doughnuts”.\u0026nbsp“Heisserer’s script endeavours to give Bullock a rich psychological backstory — something to do with her reluctance to accept motherhood and the redemption she experiences in accepting that role — and the wonderfully self-reliant actress plays the arc earnestly enough,” Variety said. “But there’s no getting around that this is a monster movie without a monster.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Due to the different paths the story can take, the film can last between 40 to 90 minutes.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch, review – Intriguing but imperfect How Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is an experiment on usWhat happened when we watched the Black Mirror film, BandersnatchIf you don’t have the time (or patience) to watch the film multiple times, however, you can pick the option that appears as the credits begin to roll, to loop back to a crucial moment in the story and change your choices, to see if they cause a different ending.This means that you can see most of the possible variants without having to start from the very beginning.\u0026nbspThese are the endings fans have discovered so far:1) The very quick one,\u0026nbspwhere the user accepts an offer to join Thakur\u0027s team and develop his video game in the office, instead of refusing. Bandersnatch\u0026nbspthen flashes to an ending in which a rushed version of his game gets zero stars from a critic, as Stefan decides to “try again” — inviting the viewer to go back and make him develop the game on his own.\u0026nbsp2) In another, Stefan\u0027s widower father comes into his room after weeks of Stefan working alone on the game. You can either force Stefan to shout at his dad or make him throw\u0026nbsphis tea\u0026nbspover his computer. Destroying Stefan’s computer ends the story. In a similar moment, when Stefan becomes frustrated with the game\u0027s progress you can either make him destroy his computer or bang his fist on the desk. Destroying the computer ends the game, again.3) The balcony ending happens when Stefan is taken to see Dr Haynes by his father, where he spots Colin walking down the street. If Stefan follows Colin instead of attending therapy, the pair embark on a night of drugs and philosophy, which then leads to a moment where Colin claims it doesn\u0027t matter if one of them jumps from his balcony.\u0026nbspThe viewer is told to either force Stefan to jump,\u0026nbspor make him tell Colin to do it. The former choice ends the story with Stefan’s suicide, and his game is finished “abruptly” without him, to negative reviews.4) Bandersnatch pushes the story forward so that Stefan has to visit Dr Haynes for a session and get a prescription for pills. If you do choose to make Stefan see Dr\u0026nbspHaynes instead of following Colin, she’ll give him the pills and you’ll have to decide whether he should flush them or take them.\u0026nbspOnce you make Stefan take his medication, the story jumps to Christmas, where Stefan has been taking his pills for months. His game is released, but the critic only gives it two-and-a-half stars and criticises it for feeling as though it were made on\u0026nbsp“autopilot”.5) In\u0026nbspthe most meta ending of the film, Stefan demands to know the truth: Who is controlling him? If you decide to tell him that his life is actually\u0026nbspentertainment on “a streaming platform from the early 21st century” (Netflix), he returns to\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspHaynes’s office to tell her about it.\u0026nbspThe doctor points out that if Stefan’s story was true, surely this scenario of him at a therapist\u0027s office would be too boring for such an advanced form of entertainment. Things then take a bizarre turn as she leaps out of her chair and challenges him to a brawl, complete with swords.\u0026nbspYou have to decide whether Stefan should fight her or flee by jumping through a window, and if you choose the latter, the fourth wall breaks completely, revealing Stefan is\u0026nbspactually an actor standing on the Black Mirror set. A\u0026nbspdirector then storms over to tell him that he’s “not scripted to jump out, it’s the fight scene now.. The story ends after the actor asserts that his real name is Stefan, marking his final break with reality, and the production team calls a medic.6) There are several endings where\u0026nbspStefan goes to prison\u0026nbspfor murdering his father. (Depending on the route, he also ends\u0026nbspup killing Thakur, Colin, or Colin’s wife, Kitty) In all these versions of the story, you\u0027re essentially forced to make Stefan kill his father if you didn’t choose to already.\u0026nbspThen you have to decide between burying or chopping up his body. All the ways of burying the body lead to Stefan in jail and Bandersnatch getting trashed by the critic, if it gets released at all.7) Arguably the most sinister ending is when you make Stefan chop up his dead father\u0027s body, and he finally gets time to finish the game,\u0026nbspwhich gets five stars from the critic when it’s released — although the game is\u0026nbsppulled from sale after Stefan gets caught and sent to jail. From there, Bandersnatch flashes forward to the present day, where Colin\u0027s daughter Pearl is shown to be working on an archive version of the game for a new generation. When she encounters the\u0026nbspsame bugs that Stefan did, the old question returns: should she throw tea\u0026nbspher computer, or destroy it?8) A few people worked out that “TOY” is the password that Stefan needs to recover his favourite stuffed bunny from his father’s safe, he then travels back to that moment in his past and places it under his childhood bed. His mother still misses her train while the young Stefan looks for his toy, but this time\u0026nbspthe viewer is given more than one choice when she asks if he wants to go with her. If Stefan says “yes,” he dies in the train crash with his mum, after which the teenage Stefan is shown suddenly dying in his therapist\u0027s office.One fan went the extra mile and made a graph of all the alternatives in the same style as the game map itself:Reviews for the new film have been mixed, but mostly positive.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsppraised it for being “innovative” with the interactive elements, adding:\u0026nbsp”What saves the film from pure gimmickry is the way in which its mechanism is bound up with the plot.Created with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

Andy Martin reportsClick to followThe IndependentZia and his Velocity co-founder Alex MacdonaldI was wearing my Kenzo patchwork jacket, my Billabong denim shirt, and a sort of Gareth Southgate waistcoat. And I had slapped on David Beckham\u0026nbspHomme quite liberally. I was taking notes with my Montblanc pen, trying to blend in with supermodels, Premiership footballers\u0026nbspand hedge fund manager types\u0026nbspat a snazzy restaurant in the upmarket Tribeca neighbourhood of Manhattan. Because I was having a power breakfast with Zia Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of Velocity. And if you’re worrying about how much it costs to join, then it’s probably not for you. “And your membership name is?” said the exceptionally charming hostess at the door. For a brief while, I was living the dream. Even the smashed avocado on toast seemed like the best smashed avocado I’d ever tasted. Likewise the coffee. And the cutlery and the napkins were outstanding too. “My mum told me not to buy nice things,” Yusuf says, “because you always lose them.” Velocity doesn’t do things, it does experiences. In an exclusive way. For “premium consumers”. “We treat members as human beings,” said Yusuf, “not very rich people.”Yusuf’s key insight is that even if you’re as rich as Croesus, you still need a digital Jeeves – an all-purpose concierge service – to fix things for you, discreetly, effortlessly, infallibly. I didn’t even try to download the Velocity app. It can probably spot if you’re not a billionaire.A View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonA View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techZia Yusuf, 32, did not come from money. Born in a village outside Aberdeen, he is the son of Sri Lankan parents. His father is a paediatrician for the NHS and his mother is a nurse. At the age of 13 he had a moment that he still recalls fondly, when his father came into his room and said, “Do you want to go to Disney World?” He had always wanted to go to Disney in Paris, but his father said, “We’re not going there, we’re going to the original in Florida!” They had scrimped and saved and maxed out the credit card and it was still 10 months in the future – and the young Yusuf was so excited he could hardly sleep for the last month. “But it was something to look forward too. That’s what we try to provide at Velocity. It’s about making you feel like a kid again.”He went to Hampton School, then studied international relations at the LSE. In his final year he signed up for Merrill Lynch, for the sake of “peace of mind”. But this was in 2008. After Lehman Brothers went to the wall he got in touch with the guy who had given him the job, just to make sure everything was still in place. He got an automated message back: “This person is no longer with the company…” Nothing is plain sailing. Everything always goes wrong. Unless, that is, you’re a Velocity member. There’s a story by Kafka of a bloke who goes up to an open door but the doorman keeps him waiting outside for years until he is finally dying and then he slams it shut. Tough. Velocity is like that, but the exact opposite. There’s a guy holding the door open and ushering you through it very respectfully wherever you go. If you’re a member, you’re walking on a red carpet the whole world over. You get the top table at the Ivy or a seat at the Wimbledon final. If you want to go surfing, they’ll arrange the perfect wave, with palm trees and sultry breezes, just for you. If you’re looking for the Holy Grail, it’s here, somewhere on the app. You want the moon? Have it. Have two. You have a dream? Dream no longer. “We’re a tech company,” says Yusuf, pushing a perfect mini-croissant in my direction. “But tech is a means not an end in itself.” The average “basket size” is $2,500. The biggest is $500k – for a single transaction. Client data is sacrosanct. No harvesting or marketing. Trust is paramount. F Scott Fitzgerald reckoned that “the very rich are different from you and me”. Ernest Hemingway replied, “Yes, they have more money.” Yusuf is more of the Hemingway school of thought. It was while at Goldman Sachs that he realised two things. One is that the super-rich have exactly the same anxieties and desires as everyone else. And the other is that they are not “leading crazy lives of hedonistic pleasure”. “They’re obsessed with what they do. They have more capital, but they suffer from time poverty.” Velocity gives them time back again by doing everything for them at the click of a button. Check the app. You want to go and swim with blue whales? It’s done. You want to… and here, glancing through the app, I come across something so sublime that I am not even allowed to say what it is. “As easy as ordering an Uber.” There is no hassle. Hassle has been abolished in the great and glorious realm of Velocity. It is, I have to concede, a wonderful world. Velocity was born in 2014 and launched in public after two years of development. “We (Yusuf and co-founder Alex Macdonald) agreed with Elon Musk – it can’t be slightly better, it’s got to be amazing.” They can do something as simple and sentimental as picking up your grandma at the airport too. And there is a romantic side. They have now arranged 14 full marriage proposals, always in the perfect setting, with (so far) 100 per cent success rate. I imagine they can do orces too, in a beautiful way. Yusuf himself used his own app recently. He had almost forgotten his mother’s birthday. Velocity stepped in and saved the day: a Sri Lankan-style dinner at Hoppers in London. “My Mum is hard to please,” says Yusuf, but she was delighted. “It was a lot better than an e-card.” He’s going to take her on safari the next time.It’s hard not to agree with Yusuf that “the paradox is that we have the ability to go and do more than any generation in history. But our tendency is to order in a pizza and binge on Netflix.” He wants to get busy people out into the real world again – effortlessly. And he stresses a surprisingly ethical dimension to the whole business. It’s not just about arranging meaningful and magical moments, or even matrimony. These experiences can actually make a difference to the wider world because the people having them also have a lot of power. Yusuf cites the case of a CEO who went on a “giraffe collaring” adventure with a team of conservationists. “He came out of it a changed man. His company went green overnight and he killed all single-use plastic cups. And our platform made it happen. Nothing beats an experience for changing your view of the world.” Which is why the velocity.black website has a special section called “impact”. “It all sounds great,” said a hard-working single mother who was giving me a lift later in the day, as I was coming down from Cloud 9. There was just a hint of bitterness in her voice. “I would like to go swimming with whales and tagging giraffes. Can I join?” “Of course you can,” I replied, soothingly. “You just have to win the lottery first.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He would ring, to tell me what the weather was like over there, while I was suffering, in grey, wet, chilly London. Or how, he was enjoying some fine, French wine he’d taken specially while sitting with his feet dangling in the warm, balmy sea.Not any more. So far, the phone has lain silent. Although after reading this, he might ring again, as he did in the summer, because I wrote something he did not agree with. Once again, I was treated to a volley of abuse, much of it too crude to repeat here.It’s been a recurring theme of 2018, the PR demise of Sir Philip Green or “PG” as he is known throughout the sector and City. When the year began, he’d still not recovered from the fallout over the sale of BHS to someone who did not have the financial muscle to take on a business of that size, and Green’s subsequent refusal to plug the company’s pension deficit. He did cough up, eventually, and only after much protest.Then, came Oliver Shah’s excellent biography, Damaged Goods: the Inside Story of Sir Philip Green, the Collapse of BHS and the Death of the High Street. It painted a colourful picture of Green, and his swaggering, bruising manner.That was followed by the revelation that Green had gagged former employees from detailing his sexual and racial harassment – claims that he vehemently denies.Finally, Green’s Arcadia group was exposed to what was a horrid shopping season. It certainly was an annus horribilis for him, reputation-wise, not that he would ever reach for a polite Latin phrase as the Queen once famously did – Green would opt for a more Anglo-Saxon wording.Sir Philip Green’s and Simon Cowell business partnership Spare a thought for poor old billionaire Philip GreenSir Philip Green’s net worth and retail empireWhen he looks back on where it all went wrong – to apply some context he remains incredibly wealthy, is still a high street force, retains his knighthood, and became a grandfather, but there’s no doubt he’s suffered – he only has himself to blame.That sense of self, of believing entirely in his own gifts, has propelled him to great heights. He’s a natural, intuitive, aggressive deal-maker, blessed with an uncanny propensity for mental arithmetic. Whether he’s a genius at the longer game of retailing is a moot point. Certainly, he knew how to build an empire, and to keep it buoyant – for a while. But did he read the long-term runes, and foresee the advent of online shopping, and did he exhibit the same fleetness of foot as some of his competitors?Green is not someone who responds constructively to criticism. If the media and politicians attack his convoluted financial arrangements that see the business vested in the name of his wife who lives in Monaco as a way of avoiding tax, he will roar his defiance.A more publicly empathetic person, one who cares deeply about how they’re perceived, who can see that the tax line will dog him constantly and be wheeled out as a weapon to beat him with, might end the arrangement and swallow the resulting hefty bill. But they would regard it as a price worth paying, for better treatment by the press and parliament, for a favourable public standing.Not Green. Similarly, from the off, as soon as the BHS affair blew up, he could have made a payment to cover the pension gap into an escrow account, and leave the lawyers to sort out the fine detail. But he chose not to.He complained that his opponents liked to focus on his extravagant, bling lifestyle. Meanwhile, he would order another superyacht, so that he owned not one, but two. His reasoning was that his spending was none of their concern, that what he did with his money was up to him. He would describe his lavish parties as private, but then call journalists to invite them to listen, down the line, as George Michael did a sound-check.He’s never fully appreciated that he is also a public figure, a modern celebrity, who courted publicity for himself and for his fashion products, who liked to be photographed surrounded by supermodels. In many town centres, his outlets play a vital role, as anchor tenants, central to the wellbeing of the shopping districts and accompanying communities. Green is a major employer, responsible for several tens of thousands of jobs. He cannot have it both ways.As with many kings, his world is also that of a court. His advisers are courtiers, there, possibly, to please not help, to say “can” rather than “can’t”, and “yes” not “no”. It’s questionable, whether his actions and the blows to his image are the result of receiving bad advice, or disregarding good advice and preferring to do his own thing. Whatever the answer, he became badly unstuck in 2018. For that, he was my Man of the Year, but for all the wrong reasons.For anyone looking at how not to manage communications, how to make a bad public relations situation worse, Green’s last 12 months is a textbook tour de force.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/28/01/michael-palin-getty.jpg","title":"new year honours 2019 michael palin knight culture full list","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

I don’t understand the logic of that.”UK spends over £100m on extra ferries to ease no-deal Brexit pressuresSeaborne said in a statement it had been working since 2017 on plans to reintroduce ferry sailings from Ramsgate from early 2019 and has been “financed by the shareholders” during a development phase.The company said this had involved ”locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure – such as bunkering – as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating”.It added: “It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.“This coincides with the Department for Transport’s (DfT) freight capacity purchase agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit.”The firm was founded by industry veterans, its chief executive Ben Sharp told the BBC.Ramsgate has not had a cross-Channel service since 2013, when operators TransEuropa collapsed.\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: “That the government has reportedly signed a contract with a ferry company with no ferries pretty much sums up their farcical approach to the entire Brexit fiasco.“The government could, and should, take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table. It is being used only to try and scaremonger people into backing their deal. It is now costing the country millions – it is inexcusable and people won’t be fooled.“People must be given the final say on the Brexit deal with a people’s vote where they have the right to choose to remain.”Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “Never has it been clearer that our government is selling us down the river over Brexit.“A firm that has never run a ferry service before has been awarded a multi-million pound contract and they don’t even have any ships.“We know our ports aren’t ready for a no-deal disaster, but is hiring a firm that’s never dealt with this kind of thing before really going to help? This idea should have been sunk before it saw the light of day.”A DfT spokesman added: “This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services.“As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the company’s commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award.”Created with Sketch.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

the tallest man-made structure for , years - is the only surviving landmark out of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.Many have questioned how it would have been possible for the ancient Egyptians to build such incredible constructions using ,-year old technology.While some conspiracy theorists have suggested aliens may be involved, scientists and archaeologists have a more down-to-earth explanation.They believe thousands of slaves used sledges to pull huge stone blocks and a pulley system to haul them up the pyramids slopes.Water would be used to lubricate the stone blocks as they were lugged along the sand, before being winched into place.Researchers have now found evidence to suggest  degree ramps were used to pull blocks of stone up using a two-way pulley system.The discovery was made when a ,-year-old system was found at a quarry and archaeologists think the same system would have been applied to the building of the pyramids.While many of the earlier step pyramids didnt have smooth sides, later pyramids all did, reflecting how much the Egyptians techniques improved over time.However, we still dont know exactly how the extremely sophisticated buildings were constructed, and historians still disagree on many of the details.The oldest known pyramids in Egypt are found at the Saqqara burial ground, northwest of Memphis.Among these, the Pyramid of Djoser was the first to be built, having been completed in  BC after  years of construction work.Pyramid building peaked around  BC, with the last pyramid built at some point between  –  BC.The pyramids were ordered by pharaohs, the kings of ancient Egyptian society, who would recruit high-ranking architects and engineers to oversee their construction.However, the back-breaking construction work was left to an army of slaves and skilled labourers, who are believed, in some cases, to have worked infor food and a salary.Most of the pyramids were built as tombs.They served as the final resting places of Egypts ancient kings, who showed off their status in le by being buried in enormous pyramid tombs in death.Tourists used to be allowed to climb up to the top of the pyramids - but the Egyptian government has cracked down in recent years.For conservation reasons, visitors arent allowed inside or on top of the pyramids.You run the risk of being arrestedstart climbing, try to sneak in, or try to bribe a guard to let you. In an article published in the journal Nature, it was revealed that scientists had made the most incredible discovery in the Great Pyramid of Giza since the th century.Experts discovered a hidden -metre chamber located deep within the awe-inspiring structure, situated above its Grand Gallery.The purpose of the dramatic void is unclear, and it doesnt appear to be connected to other tunnels, which has left boffins scratching their heads.Scientists made the discovery using cosmic-ray imaging, which involves recording the behaviour of subatomic particles called muons produced when cosmic rays smash into the Earths atmosphere.Experts have also discovered the Great Pyramid of Giza can focus electromagnetic energy in its internal chambers and its base.Boffins from ITMO University and the Laser Zentrum Hannover found that the -foot building is capable of creating pockets of higher energy in its inner rooms and at its base.Scientists have deduced that the pyramid concentrates this electromagnetic energy in its hidden chambers, which includes rooms containing the remains of Pharoah Khufu and his we.The Pyramid Code documentary director Carmen Boulter does not think the Great Pyramid was used as a tomb and could have been some sort of energy machine."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  -

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, without our cash, the EU now realises there will be a massive black hole in their coffers.EU chiefs mistakenly thought they had us over a barrel and could use their leverage to get whatever they wanted.But they are now waking up to the fact that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is unlikely to get the nod and, with no deal legally our default position, a clean break looms.The refusal to give our PM any concessions does not look so wise now.The Sun has long questionedthe EU would ever prioritise their economies and citizens’ jobs over a zealous desire to punish Britain for leaving.Perhaps Mr Oettinger’s comments suggest that reality is finally dawning.IT is shocking that Britain has just TWO boats to police , miles of shoreline.Organised gangs are taking advantage of our easily penetrable coast to traffick desperate people who will risk their lives in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to get here.As many as  people have tried to cross over from France in just two months. How many more have slipped in under the radar If these people aren’t discouraged from taking such lethal risks then Britain’s beaches and ports will become as tempting as those in Spain and Italy.Our Government must stop more arriving.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”The former Luxembourg PM added: “I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Hitting back last night, a No source said: “What does he hope to achieve by saying this  I don’t know whose interests that serves”.Tory MP Nigel Huddleston dubbed it “not particularly useful or helpful language”, adding: “It is inappropriate but not surprising, as he is under pressure from European businesses to produce a deal as well”.Mrs May has been told by Tories and the DUP to seek legally binding assurances that the backstop that keeps Britain in the customs union will be time-limited.One senior aide to the PM last week dubbed Mr Juncker the UK’s “best hope” of finding a fix as he was “put on this earth to negotiate”.The new row came as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox yesterday warned that the chances of Britain leaving the EU would be down to  Mrs May’s deal is voted down in two weeks time.It also emerged that senior Tory and Labour MPs are planning to force the government to delay Brexit by three monthsthe Commons throws out the deal.It was claimed that cross-party talks have been underway for several weeks to ensure the March  date is put back until July in a bid to win the government more time.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today accuses Theresa May and her ministers of tipping Britain “into crisis” for leaving the country with no deal with the EU in place with just  days to go today until Brexit takes place.In his New Year message, the Opposition boss attacked the Tories for “the complete mess they’ve made of Brexit, trying to drive through a bad deal and letting people down all across the country whether they voted leave or remain.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Butthey start doing it now, they will be able to catch up in  to  years.”The Kremlin-backed MITT is the designer of Russia’s Yars, Topol and Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles .Solomonovs claims come as Russia deploys its new generation S- Vityaz defence system and days after warning its hypersonic missiles will render US defences useless.Solomonov said although Americas nuclear arsenal remains very powerful, it is still using Minuteman ICBMs created in the s.In the meantime, Vladimir Putins military has created a new generation of land and sea-based strategic nuclear systems, he added.They include the Sarmat RS- is ballistic missile - a -tonne missile could destroy an area the size of Texas or France.Speaking about the US ballistic missile defence system being deployed in Alaska and Europe, Solomonov said that Russia should not be afraid as its “efficiency is extremely low.”Just last week Putin boasted about the superiority of Russias new weapons as he promised to boost its nuclear arsenalthe US pulls out of a Cold War arms treaty.The Russian president specically mentioned the new Kinzhal hypersonic missile and the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which he said have no foreign equivalents.Speaking at a meeting with the top military brass in Moscow he said such weapons will help ensure the countrys security for decades to come.Kinzhal has already been commissioned by the military and aircraft carrying the missiles have flown  patrol missions this year.The high-speed Kinzhal - or Dagger - has been described by the Russian strongman an ideal weapon and can fly at almost ,mph across , miles to hit precise targets.The hypersonic intercontinental rocket is capable of travelling  times the speed of sound and can strike like a meteorite, like a fireball, Putin has said.No one has hypersonic weapons yet, but we have it, Putin told the assembled military officers.He later fired his new hypersonic ballistic missile in a final test before the invincible nukes enter service next year, according to reports.The president was in the control room as the Avangard weapon was launched at a dummy target thousands of miles away in Siberia, the Kremlin said.It comes weeks Russias defence chiefs said the missiles will be ready for deployment in , a year ahead of forecasts.US intelligence analysts have warned the West has no defence against the nukes, which can hit anywhere in the world, reports claimed earlier this year.Avangard is a believed to be a high-tech hypersonic glide vehicle which is mounted on board an SS- intercontinental ballistic missile.Once launched from the rocket at high altitude, it is designed to use aerodynamic forces to sail on top of the atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound.It could carry a warhead, experts say, but even without explosives its sheer speed - more than a mile a second - gives it the force to obliterate any target.And it thought to be highly manoeuvrable and equipped with electronic countermeasures that can defeat the most sophisticated missile tracking systems.Thomas Karako, director of the Missile Defence Project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC: These kinds of boost glide vehicles attack the gaps in our missile defence system.He added it was unfortunate that we have let Russia come this far.And Air Force General John Hyten, commander of US Strategic Command, has told the Senate Armed Services Committee: Both Russia and China are aggressively pursuing hypersonic capabilities.We dont have any defence that could deny the employment of such a weapon against us.Earlier this month state news agency Tass reported a senior commander saying the first Avangard weapons will be deployed in .Colonel-General Sergei Karakayev said: First complexes are planned to be put on combat duty at the missile regiment of the Dombarosky ision starting next year.Last week, the Russian navy began sea trials of a nuclear drone that experts fear could trigger radioactive tsunamis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458358328.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"arron hough cruise ship image family","story":"As family pay tribute to their “superstar” relative, his sister, Emilie, has changed her Facebook cover photo to show her beloved brother dancing.Arron, , from Sunderland, was last seen on Christmas Day aboard the Harmony of the Seas – the second biggest liner on the planet – some  miles off Puerto Rico.It is still not known what happened to the young Brit who was spotted on CCTV at around am on Tuesday entering Deck  of the ship.Hundreds of messages of support have been posted on Emilie’s Facebook page, with friends calling him truly special.And a relative, Rebecca Hough, praised Arron as the family’s “superstar” next to video footage of him performing on stage.The Sunderland community has also spoken of the entertainer’s talent and beautul soul.Residents have paid tribute to his “lovely” personality by posting messages of support for his family and friends on the Sunderland Echo’s Facebook page.Relative Michelle Loughlin said: “My cousin so so sad family are devestated [sic].Alison Mackintosh posted: “Thinking of Arron’s family at this time, so so very sorry, heartbreaking to say the least.You don’t expect anything like this to happen -

He had no problems that I knew of.“He was talented, outgoing and young. He just wanted to be a performer.The Urdang Academy tweeted: We are all praying for @Arronhoughxox and his family.Please keep up your hope and faith that he is found safe and sound as soon as possible.”The cruise company says its care team is providing support to his family, adding its thoughts and prayers are with them during this dficult time.A friend of Arron said she was “heartbroken beyond words” at the news.She said: “Arron is the type of person people can only wish to have in their lives.“He lights up any room like no one  can and everyone who knows and loves him has so many happy and cherished memories.“His infectious laugh and beaming smile is enough to pull anyone out from feeling down in the dumps.“I hope and pray we get our Arron back home where he belongs, the light of our lives has gone out.Others shared their thoughts and prayers for Arron online.Fellow singer and actor Andy Rose said: Always have and always will be a family at the Urdang Academy #PrayForArron.Kathryn-Anne Rivers said: So heart breaking!

We are organising, ­protesting, shaming and building power.We are making the women’s movement central to everyone’s conversation. Women are finding their voice.And the most important thing is we are getting heard.We are not going to accept mansplaining or being ­spoken down to “stupid woman”.Feminism is the word of the year, with more and more women standing up for themselves and demanding equality, and I predict that process is going to continue in .Now that I think about it, there were other good things about .It was the year we rediscovered hope in football during the World Cup.We did better than we thought we would — and it’s not often we can say that.The England team and manager Gareth Southgate restored our ­national self-esteem and gave us something to cheer about when there really was not much .The World Cup showed us nice guys can win.Sure, we didn’t bring home the trophy but it’s fair to say Gareth Southgate’s a winner in everyone’s eyes.And it’s not over yet:  is the women’s football World Cup — so that’s something to look forward to with hope.Hope is an important word. And now, more than ever, we need to find a way to hang on to the things that make us feel optimistic about the future.There were other hopeful things about .This was the year that gave us the breath of fresh air that is Meghan Markle — and it also saw the most stylish royal wedding this country has probably ever seen.Meghan was a signier of change for the Royal Family, which needed to modernise.And while I know some people have decided she is “pushy”, or criticise her for her relationship with her father, I think Meghan is one of the best things that has ever happened to our royals.We also had a royal baby — Prince Louis — and now we have another one on the way, which is happy news.My personal highlight of  was having lunch at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.It really was a wonderful occasion, spending intimate time talking to such an inspiring woman.And now here we are, poised on the brink of .I’m not a New Year’s Eve ­person.

Many of these changes will only happen in April , which marks the new tax year. But an important few kick in on New Years Day itself. Heres a quick guide.   Energy giants will finally be banned from charging you more than a set amount from January . The cap - introduced by Theresa May after a long campaign marked by fudges and climbdowns - is set to help the million families on a default tarf. Default tarfs are the ones you end up onyou choose not to switch, ora fixed-term tarfs comes to an end and you dont pick a new one. Ofgem set the cap in November at pound, a year for a typical dual fuel customer who is paying by direct debit. That will save typical customers on default tarfs an average of pound a year, rising to pound for those whove been getting the worst deal. This cap is NOT the same as a freeze on prices. The cap can still rise to keep up with inflation and market forces.   From January , UK listed firms with more than  firms will have to start recording the ratio between their highest-paid and average-salary employees. It meansyoure middle-ranking at a software giant or a football club, youll know how many more times your salary the chief executive is making. Its all in good time for Fat Cat Friday, January , when FTSE  bosses will have already earned a typical workers wage for the whole of . Except its not, because January  is only the day the pay gaps start being recorded. They will only be actually published in . The way of measuring ratios has also come under fire, because it doesnt look at the lowest-paid staff, such as cleaners. Low-paid staff are also sometimes outsourced, leading to fears they could be left out of the figures.   EU rules on fishing are coming into effect on New Years Day - and a watchdog has warned they could have a devastating impact on the UKindustry. The landing obligation forces boats to bring fish caught beyond their quotas to shore, instead of throwing them back into the sea. After a four-year phasing-in period, it comes into effect in full on January . The aim is to conserve fish stocks by encouraging fishermen to be more selective about what they catch. But the law has been branded badly designed by UK fishermen because it could clog up busy harbours with extra beauracracy. The House of Lords EU Energy and Environment Sub-committee heard evidence that the rule could mean fishermen hitting their annualquotas much earlier in the year, with an estimated pound million worth of fish remaining uncaught in  as a result.

The Labour leaders  and  messages are similar in many ways. In both he pledges to stand up for the majority and unite the country against a privileged elite. But theres one big dference. Last time he didnt mention Brexit once. Now its front and centre of his address - an echo of just how much its come to dominate politics in the UK.  Theres a more subtle, but maybe more important, dference too - his tone. In his  message, Jeremy Corbyn was still floating on a better-than-expected performance in the general election. The message was of hope - promising the establishment had been weakened and a Labour government was closer than ever before. But with Theresa May trying to cling on almost until , and surviving a no confidence vote, those phrases are missing from this years address.  Instead the tone is more one of despair at the deadlock thats gripped the country over Brexit in the last  months, adding: We cannot go on like this. So how much do you think the message has changed  Weve put both new year messages side by side so you can think for yourself. Jeremy Corbyns  New Year messageI’d like to wish you all a Happy New Year. Ours is a fantastic country full of wonderful, caring and talented people with the hope of a great future ahead of us, where we all share in the wealth we create. But we are being held back by a self-serving elite, who look after themselves and their friends and a failed system which delivers staggering wealth at the top, while more and more people struggle to simply make ends meet. In  we said: no more. There is an alternative and millions joined our cause in the General Election. And now the establishment’s secret is out: they’re not as strong as they appear. Let’s face it, they have no idea how to fix their broken system or upgrade our stagnant economy. In , Labour’s mission is to give our people support and security and use their talents, unleash their creativity and fulfil their hopes. The old political consensus is finished. We are staking out the new centre ground in British politics, backing the things which most people want but are blocked by vested interests. We are a government in waiting, while the Conservatives are weak and ided and stuck in an outdated rut with no new ideas. The hope of a new Britain, run in the interests of the many, not the few, is closer than ever before.Together we can, and we will, deliver it. Jeremy Corbyns  New Year message I’d like to wish everyone a very Happy New Year. There’s so much talent across Britain but we’re being held back by a system that for far too long has only served a privileged few. And now the Conservatives have plunged the country into crisis over the complete mess theyve made of Brexit, trying to drive through a bad deal and letting people down all across the country whether they voted leave or remain. Eight years of damaging Tory failure has left us with a ided country where millions are struggling to make ends meet, where so many can’t afford a home to call their own, where older people are deprived of the dignity they deserve and far too many are working in low paid and insecure jobs. We cannot go on like this. Labour is ready to deliver a radical alternative to rebuild and transform our country. Well stand up to the powerful few so that the wealth you create is shared fairly not hoarded by a privileged elite. We’ll work to create a society where the talent of everyone is unleashed. That’s how we’ll unite our country. In , lets rebuild Britain for the many, not the few.

My bags are packed, passport ready, boarding pass in my pocket and by the end of the day I will be back in Europe, and yes, it is because of Brexit. I wont go into a long political explanation, because the politics are only secondary. I am leaving because of the way le in the UK has changed for me since the vote. I moved to the UK seven years ago for university. Originally, it was only to study and I wasnt planning on staying. I just wanted to improve my English. But within the first six months I realised I loved the country. I loved the people and the fact that there is no formal and informal addresses for people, just you, I loved the fact that people call each other love, whether they know me or not. I loved le, and the language, and I even put up with the non mixer taps. This farewell article originally appeared on SomersetLive, where Claire Violette Herbaux had been working as a reporter.    Even though I only lived in the UK on and off after uni, I always planned on coming back. This is where I felt at home and where I was going to spend my le. But then I came back after the vote and things had changed. Now I hear people talk about foreigners and how they are waiting for March  for them to leave. Using the word Brexit in the conversation seems to have made it acceptable to say such things. This isnt a one-time occurrence. A sentence like this is uttered about once a week. Because I dont have a French or German accent , they dont realise they are talking about me.   And they are probably generalising and thinking of Eastern Europeans or even refugees, not me, but nevertheless I am part of this group of people they would prefer to leave their country. And this is what it boils down to. For the first time in my le, I am part of a group of people who are dferent and possibly dont belong. And let me tell you, it doesnt feel good. But there is of course also an element of uncertainty of how Brexit will unfold in  and how it will affect EU residents like me. I feel like I contribute in the same way as anyone  and I would want to be treated that way. Not a single day goes by without someone mentioning Brexit, the news reporting on it, or a meme showing up on Facebook.   Every time it does, it reminds me that the country I live in has decided to turn against everything I believe in. The EU isnt perfect, but I am proud to be European and I have grown up seeing the borders slowly disappear between countries and travel between my two homes in France and Germany becoming easier each year. No more numerous wallets for the currencies, no more stopping for border control. Every time I hear Brexit I remember the country is trying to distance itself from the this concept which I hold very dear. So while le is never perfect, I will go back to Europe. We have our own issues and politics to deal with, but at least I belong, I am a resident like any other, and I dont have to worry about my status changing because I am not a citizen. I will have the same rights as anybody  and enjoy the upsides of EU - which I have learned to appreciate even more since the Brexit talks began.

The Three Lions cast aside footballing giants Tunisia, Panama, Colombia and Sweden before bravely falling to Croatia in the semi-finals. But that extra time defeat has long vanished from the memories.

A chef called James Cochran got into a row with the restaurant where he once worked... called James Cochran James Cochran left James Cochran in early  - but not before the restaurant trademarked his name. Cochran, who has starred on BBCs Great British Menu and once had two Michelin stars, was not happy that the restaurant continued to trade with his name. On the eve of his BBC Two debut, Rayeula set up a website,jamescochran, which advertised the use of his name and recipes for pound a week to pubs and restaurants. In August he tweeted: “Anyone wanna buy me  My ex-employers are the lowest of low trying to sell off my name as recipes plans  !! Wtf   Who is going to pay pound a week just to add my name in front of the recipe   I will give you the recipes for freeyou’re that low!!”.  The owners of the James Cochran brand said they had trademarked his name long ago, before he left the company, and that it was well before he secured his appearance on the Great British Menu. Cochran is now head chef at his own restaurant,  in Islington. And hes changed his Twitter name to The Real James Cochran.

The one where a man who looked like Ross from Friends allegedly stole booze Lets not kid ourselves -  has been an intense year. So it was with unbridled glee the internet seized on the story of thethief in Blackpool who looked strikingly similar to Ross from Friends . The story quickly went viral and it was taken up another notch when Schwimmer himself spoofed the footage. Schwimmers tweet has been retweeted , times.    Perhaps owing to the huge publicity of the footage, a suspect, Abdulah Husseni was arrested and charged with stealing a crate of beer.

Seconds after Banksys Girl With Red Balloon sold for poundm at Sothebys auction house the work partially shredded itself. People were stunned and analysts fell over themselves trying to guess what Banksy meant by his daring act. Was it a statement on the value of art in high society  Was it a damning rebuke of empty consumerism  Or was he simply trolling the art world    Regardless, the purchaser of the paintingwas still laughing. The stunt helped increase the estimated value of the work, renamed Love Is In The Bin, to at least pound.m.

Bungling Russian spies were caught trying to launch a cyber attack on a weapons watchdog Four smartly dressed Russians who arrived in the Netherlands trying to pass themselves off as tourists, were, of course nothing of the sort. They were undercover officers working for GRU, Russias biggest and most powerful spy agency. They were on a mission to try and hack in to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons . But their GRU training must have skipped over some of the important lessons for covert spies. British intelligence knew of their April plot in advance and tipped off their Dutch colleagues. When counter-espionage officials felt they had enough evidence they swooped on the four and found fairly damning evidence of an attempted cyber attack. In the car boot was a G smartphone, a transformer, a battery bag and a WiFi  antenna. Oh but theres more. In the car was €, and , in crisp hundred denomination bills. And on their phones were even photos of taxi receipts one of the men had used to get from GRU HQ to the airport where they flew to Amsterdam. James Bond, they aint. . Witches complained about Donald Trump calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt The ongoing soap opera that is the Trump White House means this entire list could have been made of stories surrounding the US President. But our pick is a late entry from December - when witches complained about Donald Trump repeatedly calling the Mueller investigation into possible collusion with Russia a WITCH HUNT . Robert S. Muellers wide-ranging probe continued to create headaches for the bouffant-haired President. He could not resist repeatedly taking to Twitter to label it a witch hunt, while also decrying the lack of federal investigations into his political opponent from  Hillary Clinton. By December the witches of the United States had had enough.   For those who practice witchcraft, the president’s words bring up a painful period in history, when men and women were accused of being witches and murdered, both in the American colonies and in Europe. Kitty Randall, who uses the name “Amber K.” in the witching world, calls the period a “traumatic emotional imprint” on modern-day witches. She told The Daily Beast: To have him compare his situation to the worst period in our history is just infuriating.

It takes place over a few days, with the main event on NYE. The party carries on into January  and  - both are Bank Holidays in Scotland.  Where Hogmany began is unknown, though some think it was the Vikings, who invaded Scotland in the -th century. Norse raiders celebrated Winter Solstice with parties and it seems the tradition has carried on.  Where does the word Hogmanay come from  Defined as December  or New Years Eve or the last day of the year in the Dictionary of the Scots Language . The etymology of the word is up for debate. Some think its French, others think its Anglo-Saxon.“The name could come from the Anglo-Saxon ‘haleg monath’ meaning holy month,” Dr Donna Heddle, director of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands, told theBBC. “But the most likely source seems to be French. In Normandy presents given at Hogmanay were ‘hoguignetes’.”After Mary Queen of Scots ed to Scotland its thought the word became more widespread - she had been in France in . Bank Holidays : When are the bank holidays this year How is Hogmanay celebrated  It kicks off December  with a torchlight procession in Edinburgh. There are dancers, musicians and residents that make their way on the Royal Mile, starting at Edinburgh Castle. Theres a ticketed street party too.

MPs are set to consider a law to make access to treatment fairer. Emma Edey, , denied IVF, said: “I am praying it goes through quickly.” Campaigners have branded it a disgrace that the so-called cruel postcode shylottery denies would-be parents the chance to have a child – unless they can afford private IVF. Currently only three local health authorities in England offer childless couples the recommended three free cycles of IVF, while many provide only one or none at all. But there is hope, as Labour MP Steve McCabe is pushing through legislation to bring the injustice to an end. Mr McCabe believes his private member’s bill, set for its second reading on January , could be passed into law by this time next year. He said: “Infertility is a medical shycondition and it is time we started treating it like one. It is simply unfair that access to IVF is down to where you live and not your medical need.” The Birmingham Selly Oak MP’s bill aims to get fairer access to treatment for any childless couple and would set a minimum number of IVF cycles.   He said he has cross-party support and added: “I will be doing everything in my power to make sure the postcode lottery for IVF is brought to an end.” Government is under pressure to act after the Fertility Network charity persuaded , people to sign an online petition in just  weeks. Chief executive Aileen Feeney said: “Childlessness affects one in six couples. That’s someone in every street. If you can’t get free treatment on the NHS and currently that depends completely on where you live, then only those wealthy enough to pay for IVF privately can hope to have a child. That’s disgraceful.” Aileen spent two weeks this summer cycling , miles from Land’s End to John O’Groats, raising pound, for her charity’s campaign. She will deliver the petition to PM Theresa May.   Health watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommends any woman under  should be given three full cycles of IVF, or one full cycle for those aged  to . Women who have three cycles increase their chances of having a baby to better than %. But just three of  clinical commissioning groups offer the three cycles – all in Greater Manchester. Seven offer none. Some break NICE guidelines by setting their own access rules – including reducing the age limit. Yet in Scotland any woman under  can have three full IVF cycles. In Wales women are entitled to two and in Northern Ireland those under  get one partial cycle of IVF. Those denied free IVF face having to find pound, a time for each round of treatment. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: “It’s wrong there is so little support and , backing this campaign shows the strength of feeling behind the call for change. Liberal Democrats are listening and ministers in Whitehall must listen too.” Its completely unfair Two couples from the same town demonstrate the appalling injustice of the IVF postcode lottery. Emma and Lee Edey, , married in  and were about to start IVF in  when their local CCG decided to pull the funding. Emma, , appealed against the decision, and was granted treatment only for it to be withdrawn. The Edeys await the verdict of the North East Essex CCG before Jan  to seetheir first cycle of IVF will be granted. Rachel and Tom Hinsbey also live in Colchester, Essex, but began their IVF treatment six years ago when they lived in Chelmsford - under Mid Essex CCG. They were granted the funding for a first round of treatment which saw the birth of their daughter Amalie on March , . They have since moved to Colchester and elected to use embryos frozen at the time of the first cycle of treatment to try again for another child.   The NHS funding for IVF had been withdrawn, so they paid privately at the Bourn clinic in Colchester - at a greatly reduced cost of pound. Twins Margot and Teddy were born three months ago, to make their family complete. Meanwhile a desperate Emma, who has a bowel condition but is ready for IVF, said: “We applied for exceptional circumstances, that was granted last May. “Then my hormonal levels were too high so I am back to the CCG  to seeI can go ahead with IVF. It is all to do with the egg quality. If I could afford to pay privately, I could have it tomorrow, but we do not have that kind of money.” Costs y, but could be up to pound,. North east Essex is one of the areas in England where all NHS IVF treatment has been removed or suspended. Emma described it as ‘completely unfair’ to offer IVF in one area, but not in another. “It is so frustrating to keep me waiting. “The last three years has been hell,” she added. “I am praying the law goes through Parliament quickly. None of us is any younger. I could have a three-year-old child now. Instead I am full of anger.” Rachel and engineer Tom Hinsbey, , tried for  months after their marriage to start a family before discovering Tom did not have a tube which carries sperm. They were then referred for NHS-funded IVF treatment. Rachel, , a former medical writer who now makes baby clothes, said: “The IVF funding was withdrawn six months after Amalie was born.   “We started again this time last year and we have just had twins but paid privately for the treatment ourselves. “Amalie was born in , where they inject the sperm directly into the egg which increases the chance of success. “Margot and Teddy were born three months ago using the embryos left over from Amalie’s treatment, it was cheaper for us because we stored them. “It came to about pound including treatment and drugs but that is way cheaper than it would have been otherwise. “The system is just crazy now. it is completely unfair, funding went from three frozen plus three fresh cycles in Essex to nothing. “Even London is better, Essex is now the worst place for any kind of fertility treatment. “IVF is seen as non essential and is the first thing to get axed. “But it has massive consequences for your health, physically and mentally, when you struggle to conceive. You feel as a woman that you are unable to do what you should be able to do. “Getting the specic reason something was wrong was so important - we at least knew what to do. Others are left in limbo without any explanation. That is just horrible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jools holland hootenanny live nye","story":"NewsIs Jools Hollands Hootenanny live on New Years Eve  Plus what time its on and line-upJools Hollands Hootenanny is a New Years Eve staple - but is it live ShareCommentsByJoshua KnapmanJo-Anne RowneyAudience Growth Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video watch-george-mccrae-perform-hootenanny-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf you dont like having your dreams dashed - you probably wont want to read this.

Nicola Fairbrass decided to take a cuppa to bed with her in November last year, but as she turned around to grab it from her bedside table, she felt a lump in her left breast. The married mum-of-one went to her doctor two weeks later and in December last year the -year-old was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer. Luckily, after a year of intensive treatment dog sitter Nicola, from Oakwood, Derby, is now cancer free - and credits the cup of tea with saving her le. Nicola, who drinks five cups day said: We take a cup of tea to bed most nights - tea is my preference. That night I turned around to get my cup of tea from the bedside table but as I was pulling it towards me, I felt a lump in my left breast.  I left it for about two weeks, thinking it might just be a cyst or something . But then it became bigger again, and when I went to the doctor they referred me straight to the hospital. I love tea and I think, in a way, it saved my le. Nicola, who had just taken over a brand new dog-sitting business, had a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy before she was diagnosed. While initially she was told she would need a mastectomy, her doctor suggested she tried chemotherapy first. Nicola underwent a lymph node surgery in January this year to make sure the cancer wasnt spreading, and then needed eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy for six months. But luckily the treatment worked, and the lump was reduced in size from  millimetres to  millimetres.  In August this year, Nicola had a lumpectomy and  sessions of radiotherapy to kill any cancerous cells which might have been left. Two weeks later, in September, she was declared cancer free although she must take medication for the next five to  years. Nichola said she couldnt have made it without the support of her daughter Gabrielle,  and her husband Paul, . She said: Waiting for the results was the worst, it was horrendous. I tried to carry on as best as I could because it was holiday time. My daughter was affected, she had a really hard time - but she kept being strong for me. My husband had to take time off work to help at home because I was basically housebound. But I cant moan, everyone around me has been very supportive. It has been a huge relief to get the all clear and finish treatment and just be able to get on with my le again, as my le was just on hold for the past year. It has been a very tough year, but I am glad it is over.  During her illness, Nicola had to assign her dog-sitting business, Barking Mad, to someone , but is now excited to get back to doing what she loves. She added: My adviceyou feel a lump would be get straight to the doctors, dont delay. I dont think people check themselves enough, so I want to raise awareness.

In the CCTV men can be seen carrying black bags and suitcases into the home of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, Turkey. Dressed in normal clothes, the males bring in the luggage - allegedly containing the butchered journalists remains - one after another. The residence is a short distance from the consulate where Mr Khashoggi, a leading critic of Saudi policies, was killed in early October. Reports have claimed he was murdered and cut into pieces. Last month, Turkeys Foreign Minister said the -year-old was killed within seven minutes in a premeditated murder recorded on tape.  Mevlut Cavusoglu said he had listened to the disgusting clip - which captured a forensic experts enjoyment as he cut up Mr Khashoggi. He told Germanys Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: It can be heard how the forensics expert instructs the others: they should listen to music while he cuts up the body. One notices how he enjoys it. The footage showing a number of bags being carried into the Saudi consul generals residence - allegedly on the day of the murder two months ago - was broadcast by a Turkish pro-government TV channel. The channel A Haber reported that a total of five cases were apparently taken through the main entrance of the residence by the men.  A Turkish official said the media report, also carried by the pro-government Sabah newspaper on its website, appeared to be accurate. However, they did not give further details. According to Sabah, the cases had been brought to the residence in a black minibus at : pm . There was no immediate reply from Saudi authorities to a Reuters request for comment on the footage. Mr Khashoggi was a royal insider who became a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year.  Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death. His murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of the -year-old prince, the kingdoms de facto leader. After offering numerous contradictory explanations regarding the fate of Mr Khashoggi, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him toto Saudi Arabia failed. The journalists remains have not been found and Turkey has repeatedly asked Saudi Arabia where they are.  Last month, Turkish police searched a remote villa in a coastal area southeast of Istanbul as part of the investigation. Saudi Arabias public prosecutors office said last month it is seeking the death penalty for five iniduals. It added that  of  suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court in Saudi Arabia. Mr Cavusoglu said last week Ankara was working with other countries to take the investigation into Mr Khashoggis killing to the United Nations.

It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"amount-glasgow-city-council-has-forked-out-for-supply-teachers-revealed","story":"MORE than pound millon was spent on supply teachers in Glasgow, say new figures."},{"url":null,"title":"paisley-town-hall-to-close-doors-for-major-22m-revamp","story":"A MAKEOVER worth pound million is set to bring Paisley Town Hall into the st century."},{"url":null,"title":"online-year-in-review-aftab-ali-takes-you-through-highs-and-lows","story":"WORKING in digital journalism is fast-paced, exciting and rewarding and, after a busy first year with the Evening Times, I was only too happy to take up my new role as senior digital reporter in my second year."},{"url":null,"title":"divers-downton-butler-and-a-python-get-gongs","story":"British ers who helped save a youth football team trapped inside a flooded cave in Thailand have been decorated alongside stars of entertainment, sport and the arts in the  New Year Honours list."},{"url":null,"title":"queens-new-year-honours-revealed-find-out-who-made-the-list","story":"GLASGOWS finest citizens have been recognised in the annual New Years Honours list."},{"url":null,"title":"how-celtic-rated-at-ibrox","story":"GORDON: One of only two Celtic players to emerge with passmarks.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

For myself, it has two principal components.The first is light. Most societies had and have a celebration of light at the darkest time of the year. It is a pattern followed by most of the world#s great religions.The religious reference is not only to the physical darkness of the sun being below the equator, but also the psychological darkness caused by uncertainty, loss, suffering of the body or the mind, broken relationships and the brokenness of many lives.By allowing the light of Christ to shine into our lives and bring comfort, guidance, courage, strength, we can change direction, start again and have cause for celebration.The second aspect is of birth. It really does not matter where or when Jesus was born. As Paul writes: #Jesus was born of a woman#, as we all were. The birth of a child, the gt of le, with all the potential each child has to become fully themselves.Jesus#s birth was no more or no less important to Mary and toThis time of year gives us the opportunity to celebrate le and perhaps, as the years pass and we look back, to reflect on how we have used our gts and talents.Is the world a better place because I we have walked this way  Is the world a better place because the Christ has walked this way If you are together as family, be happy together. Le is too valuable to spoil a celebration. If you are alone, I trust there are folk around you who will share with you.Whoever you are, may the light and the love of Christ#s coming bless you as you journey.As isional commander, I sincerely hope this very special time of year is one that is fun-filled, enjoyed by all, and everyone is kept safe.It’s also a time for reflection. For my own part, I’m amazed at how quickly the year has passed.  has been a satisfying year as our strong local partnerships with our local authorities and other service providers have been built on to ensure close collaboration as problems arose.This approach delivered on our shared priorities to enhance the lives of iniduals in need of our support, and continued to nurture a safe and thriving environment for inidual and community wellbeing.We have faced several signicant challenges, not least the ‘Beast from the East’ extreme winter that caused such disruption across the country.During this Year of Young People, I am proud that the ision has continued to lead the way in Police Scotland in our innovative deployment of Youth Engagement Officers. Their interactions with young people make many positive interventions in their lives. We’ve also continued to grow the number of our teams of active and enthusiastic Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Police Scotland#s festive campaign provides useful advice regarding protecting you your home and property, and safety advice for shopping and using ATMs. Please check this on our social media pages.I hope you all enjoy the New Year and I encourage all to take care throughout the festive period."},{"url":null,"title":"aladdin produces five star christmas","story":"NewsAladdin produces a five star Christmas show to keep Ayr Gaiety crowds coming back for moreTheres still time to catch the festive cracker at Ayr Gaietyyou havent managed to get there in person yet.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe stars of the Gaiety panto\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Christmas wishes are being granted again at Ayrs Gaiety with this year’s pantomime‘Aladdin’.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this. One of the endearing things about the Europeans, and I say this as a Brexiteer, is their cafe culture. This type of activity would be forbidden in places like Jedburgh.ldquoWhen a family goes to the park for a picnic, and brings a bottle of wine, they are now caught in the battle between over-legislation and common sense.ldquoI would say letrsquos encourage cafe lestyle, and its economic potential for increasing footfall and destination desirability.Although councillor Hamiltonrsquos motion was defeated by  votes to seven, councillors decided not to submit their by-laws to the Scottish Government and instead opted for more research into the potential benefits and disadvantages and for further public consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-accused-of-paying-over-the-odds-for-lowood-estate","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has been told ldquoit may come to regret its decision to buy what remains of the Lowood Estate after it was revealed that government valuers advised the authority it would be paying over the odds.The council has spent pound.m on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.Council officers believe that the site, as part of a wider Tweedbank development plan, will create  permanent jobs, and a similar number during the construction phase.The site has also been earmarked for a -home housing estate.At a full meeting of the council yesterday, December , its executive member for business and economic development, Mid-Berwickshire councillor Mark Rowley, told members: ldquoThis was a project set in motion by a previous council.ldquoIn , the previous council agreed to the purchase of Lowood in principle, and over the last few years, work has been developing on this.ldquoWhat makes this incredibly important, probably more important than it was in , is that with all the talk around budgets, the council can no longer just sit back and try to carry on carrying out services.ldquoWe need to take decisive and strategic action, and this is an incredibly bold, and good, large-scale development.ldquoItrsquos maximising benefits wersquore already seeing with the Borders Railway. It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

From there we made our to a nearby farmhouse.#We could not believe what had happened.#This whole operation, from ship to shore took around an hour.Mr McLean became a key witness in a Royal Navy Inquiry later in January and there was outrage when the court findings were sealed for  years.Mr McLean revealed that he still had the watch that he had worn on Ne’erday .Mr McLean pointed to a sideboard and revealed that in a drawer was the watch that he wore that night.His family said later that he never forgot his fight for survival in the howling gale and raging sea.The ill-fated Iolaire was originally launched as the privately owned Almathaea in  and taken into WW Royal Navy Service. She was known as HM Yacht Amalthea.This spelling is shown on the football on a rare group photograph of the football team in their strips and also shows other crewmen and officers in unorm.At the end of WW Mr McLean’s son Neil, a well- known Campbeltown fisherman, decided he wanted a fishing boat and the family decided there was only one name she could have. She was named Amalthea and was CN .Mr McLean’s, grandson, Duncan McArthur, a fishing boat skipper, told Angus Martin, Campbeltown historian and author of his grandfather’s firstto Stornoway aboard the Amalthea while fishing in the Minch.Angus Martin’s book,The North Fishing. Ring Netting in the Minches tells that on histo Stornoway in  Mr McLean did not go ashore.He was unsure as to how locals would react to him, even after the time which had elapsed, being an Iolaire survivor and a crewman of the yacht on which so many others had died.Mr McLean was cheered up to no end when a local man turned up at the quayside and insisted that he accompany him into town.Duncan always believed that the man was also a survivor.The family of the late James McLean, who is buried in Kilkerran Cemetery will always remember him, as having done his duty under the worst circumstances.Mr McLean’s statement to the Courier in January, , #We did our jobs,# could be a fitting epitaph.James McLean December , - April , .

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-ministers-book-of-poetry-inspired-by-the-bible","story":"The Rev Jock Stein, along with we Margaret, was joint locum minister at Cockenzie Old Parish Church before stepping down in .Originally he started writing one poem for each of the  books in the Bible and then, encouraged by friends, expanded his poetic project further.He said: ldquoThey said to me it was daft just to approach it that way as it would be too complicated and folk might not understand it, so it was suggested I focus on people and their stories, which is why From Cosmos to Canaan is the first of many volumes.ldquoIn it I examine key issues and use poetry to give a new slant on it.

Before bringing its Budget back to Parliament, the SNP must think again.One of the social security levers provided to Holyrood after the independence referendum was the ability to \"top up\" reserved benefits.Ahead of Finance Secretary Derek Mackayrsquos draft Budget in December, a coalition of academics, charities and anti-poverty groups called on the minority SNP administration to boost child benefit by pound.In a separate letter to Mackay, senior church figures also demanded the Government act with ldquogreater urgency by backing the same policy.The benefit, which is taxable for some high-earning families, is currently worth pound. a week for the eldest child and pound. for additional children. A pound-a-week rise for each child has been costed at around pound million.However, Mackay snubbed the calls and the Government is sticking with its plan of introducing an ldquoincome supplement by , which could be after the next Holyrood election.New figures, produced by Scottish Labour, show that over half-a-million families would receive a boostthe policy was introduced next year.The statistics also reveal that , families with more than one child would see their income topped up by at least pound a year.Around , families with two children would receive the pound-plus rise, as would , family units with three children, and over , families with four or more kids.In Glasgow, nearly , families fit into this category, while the figure for central Scotland is closer to ,.Critics of the proposal believe topping up the benefit, first introduced in , is an inefficient way of lting some of the , children out of poverty.At First Ministerrsquos Questions earlier this year Nicola Sturgeon said the policy would result in a ldquodrop in child poverty of ldquojust two percentage points, adding: ldquoI am not saying that that is insignicant, but we are committed to introducing an income supplement, and in doing so we must ensure that the money that is invested in it has maximum effectiveness in tackling child poverty.She also said that pound out of every pound would go to families who are not living in poverty.Children are deemed to be living in povertythey are in households with less than  per cent of median household income.Leonard told this newspaper: ldquoOur communities are being held back by austerity. The fact that one-in-four children in Scotland are spending Christmas living in poverty is nothing short of a national outrage. Children in poverty cannot wait for help, they need it now. Before bringing its budget back to Parliament the SNP must think again.ldquoLabourrsquos plan to top-up Child Benefit by pound per week will mean more than quarter of a million families across Scotland will be pound better off.\"John Dickie, chair of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: \"There is no question that families need an immediate boost to their incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing. The Scottish Governments commitment to an income supplement by  is hugely welcome, but families who are struggling to put food on the table and pay the bills now really canrsquot wait that long.ldquoA pound top up to Child Benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage that poverty wreaks.\"Rt Rev Susan Brown, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: ldquoIt is a political, social and moral imperative that we act now to effect change for the good.ldquoThe Church of Scotland stands alongside people of all faith traditions, and none, in the move towards fairness for all our children.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate child poverty.ldquoWe are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most, as research shows topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.ldquoOur Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan outlines action to reduce child poverty, including investing poundm in intensive employment support for parents, introducing our new Financial Health Check service and increasing school clothing grants. In addition, we are also spending over poundm to help protect people from the worst impacts of UK Government welfare cuts and support those on low incomes."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9230348.jpg?type=article-full","title":"youth-roar-what-the-young-would-change-in-2019","story":"Teenagers, like Greta Thunberg, the schoolgirl and climate striker whose speech at the UN climate talks last month transfixed the world, have a lot to say about current events ndash and in many circumstances it would do us good to listen.The voice of youth has been strong here in Scotland too, in , our Year of Young People. As it comes to a close, we ask young activists, school students and youth campaigners what their hopes and fears are for the year ahead.If they could wave a magic wand, what would they make change  And what about the world around them worries them most Holly Gillibrand, \"Climate change is what concerns me most about the world. My family have been worried about climate change, but itrsquos only started dawning on me in the last few years that itrsquos really serious and that we need to do something about it.We stopped eating meat because thatrsquos bad for the environment and we try to limit the amount of times we go in the car. We use green energy and wersquore going to start growing our own vegetables.A couple of weeks ago I went into Fort William town centre, and I talked to local cafes about using plastic straws because to make plastic you use fossil fuels. We recently had a meeting because wersquore trying to create a Fort William Extinction Rebellion group so we can do some action in .I think, politically, there just needs to be much more action, because politicians and leaders are having all these climate talks but nothing is actually happening. We could tax CO, we could tax meat to encourage more sustainable and ethical eating, but that isnrsquot happening. The politicians and the government need to be doing much more.Irsquove been reading about it and the UK government is planning to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent by , which is not enough. There need to be zero greenhouse gas emissions by  worldwide.There are still people in my class who donrsquot think that climate change exists. I think that one thing that needs to happen in  is for schools to start educating young people on climate change. There needs to be more awareness. In one of my classes at high school we had some lessons on the global goals and it was depressing that climate action is number  when it should be number one.Irsquove seen quite a few of the talks by Greta Thunberg [the teenage activist who has inspired a generation with her climate strikes] and, in fact, after the holidays Irsquom going to start climate striking ndash only for an hour every Friday. Irsquom just going to sit outside school for an hour in the morning. Irsquom trying to get other people involved but on February  therersquos going to be a UK-wide school strike.Parisa Shirazi, I work for an MP, and I come at this question from what Irsquove seen in casework. There are a lot of things which make you very angry.When yoursquore working in an MPrsquos office a lot of things that you deal with are to do with social security and immigration cases and what I see day in and day out is that perfectly ordinary, good people are being treated with a hell of a lot of scepticism. We see people whose benefits are being cut, people who are very ill being dragged in for disability assessments, people who are just applying for visiting visas for their familythey have a new baby in the UK and just facing blanket refusals.So what I would like to see I less cynicism towards certain groups of people. There is a lot of scepticism towards people in the benefits system. There seems to be a lack of appreciation of the fact that the system is paid into by everyone and itrsquos thereanyone needs it. Thatrsquos what the welfare state is for ndash itrsquos not to demonise a certain group of people.Irsquove not always been political. I grew up in Northern Ireland, apathetic towards politics. I moved away when I was , studied in Durham and did my masters in Edinburgh.I feel exhausted by Brexit. I feel like it was an enormous amount of upheaval for no gain. It just fills me with despair. Becauseyou study a law degree, as I did, you hear about things like disability rights and other rights that were brought about by being part of the EU.Sanna Aziz, \"I do a lot of campaigning around race equality. What I would like to see in  is a lot more research into the racial wage gap. There is not enough prominent research into what it is like for women of colour to be in the workplace and get paid so little compared to their white or male counterparts. I would also like to see some actual work being done in that area, in trying to make that equality, some sort of initiatives so therersquos a whole government drive towards that goal.Last year I went to the United States on an exchange set up in Jo Coxrsquos memory. It was inspiring. We visited so many dferent organisations. We went just after Trump was elected and they were talking about the amount of hate crime that was spiked then in the US. The organisations there felt like they were getting pushed back, but they were still pushing forward. They were saying no matter what happens just keep pushing forward because eventually you will make change.What drives me is that when I was a kid, I experienced a lot of racially based bullying. I used to get so upset about it, but when I was older and in high school before I left, I talked to the kid and I asked him why and he didnrsquot have a proper reason for why.From then I realised a lot of it is done out of ignorance, so from then on I tried to prevent people being as ignorant, and make them come to terms with the damage they can do when theyrsquore being racist or homophobic.Irsquom studying international politics at Stirling University. A large part of me is really nervous to go into the jobs market. But again, Irsquom hopeful. Irsquom just hopeful that everything will work out and my generation will be able to maybe not fix things, but improve them.I want to see more consideration for what iniduals experience on a day-to-day basis when theyrsquore of colour. Because some days itrsquos fine, but other days you can be walking down the street and you get spat at or given dirty looks or something. Those things are not severe enough for people to say itrsquos a hate crime. Itrsquos just a day to day stigma around people of colour that I want us to get rid of. I know it wonrsquot happen overnight. It probably wonrsquot happen in the next ten years but Irsquom hopeful.Hannah Brisbane, ldquoIn  I would like to see more girls having more confidence and speaking out on issues that matter to them and being invited into important discussions. With Girl Guiding Scotland next year wersquore developing a youth forum and my role with them is helping lead to that. Irsquom really excited to give our members a space to speak out on issues that effect girls and young women.Irsquove had lots of opportunities over the past four years. Irsquove given evidence at the Scottish Parliament in committees and met MPs and MSPs. So I definitely feel that Irsquove been listened to and Irsquom keen to help other girls have that same experience. Irsquove done a lot of work on sexual harassment and in particular harassment in schools.Research we did a few years ago found that two-thirds of girls had experienced some sort of harassment in school. Thatrsquos unacceptable and we had the opportunity to bring that evidence to the Scottish Parliament and do some work with them on how we can change things, for instance develop Personal and Social Education.We started that work before the Weinstein scandal came out. Movements like MeToo and TimesUp have forced people to take these issues more seriously.Brexit makes the year ahead really uncertain. I voted Remain and Irsquom definitely worried about losing certain rights. For instance I was on an Erasmus exchange year last year and after school I worked for a year to save up to go travelling around Europe. I do French and politics at Edinburgh University, so I feel that possibilities from that might be more limited. Irsquod hope that those rights that we had will remain but no one knows what will happenNicola Sturgeon is probably one of my political heroes. I remember looking up to her even when she was just Health Secretary and thinking that women can be a force to be reckoned with in politics.Joe Hesmondhalgh, \"My biggest concern is climate change and the current climate crisis. Itrsquos always been on my radar, but the UN report that came out in September really brought it to my attention. It said we had twelve years to stop the worst effects of the potential climate crisis and that terried me. What is also terrying to me is the lack of urgency from our government and powerful institutions and the media.I got involved in Extinction Rebellion, a climate action group that uses non-violent, disruptive methods to get our voices heard, in November. I helped set up the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow group but also the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow University group and Irsquove been involved in two direct actions so far. Irsquom willing to be arrested for this because itrsquos the most important thing there is.When I think of all of the issues I care about, climate change will make all of them worse. I really care about homelessness ndash it will make that worse. I really care about human rights ndash it will make that worse. I really am willing to get arrested for it. I think a lot of other people are too.Brexit is obviously an issue which is going to have a big impact on my le, but when therersquos such a massive, global crisis looming, it almost feels like itrsquos a distraction. Wersquove got twelve years to save the planet and the Brexit negotiations will probably take that long to wrap. When you see the massive resources that are being put into Brexit negotiations and preparations fortherersquos a No Deal, it just seems crazy. We could be putting all those resources into averting climate change.What Irsquod like to see, in , is the Extinction Rebellion key demands happen. A commitment to zero carbon emissions by  would be a step in the right direction from the UK government. As a rich country, our government and us, as the public, have to take the lead in trying to avert the climate breakdown. I think creating fair climate policy is also a democratic issue.This is the first time Irsquove ever got involved in any direct action ndash for two reasons. Firstly, the UN climate change report had an impact on me and, secondly, I think Extinction Rebellion feels genuinely dferent. It feels like wersquove been signing petitions and writing to MPs for years and this is fresh and new and it exciting. Wersquove tried all the non-disruptive methods. I think itrsquos time to try disruptive methods.For a while I wasnrsquot optimistic about the future. Hearing, over the years, all the evidence and reports about climate change does make you cynical and it makes you want to switch off, but I think, after joining Extinction Rebellion and other groups, Irsquove stopped feeling miserable or cynical. I felt the same about homelessness but then I started volunteering at Shelter. I think working together with other people really does make you feel better about it. I think the best way to not feel miserable about these things is to do something about it alongside other people.\"Callum Lynch, \" is the year that Scotland has the opportunity to fundamentally reshape what a childhood can be for people who are or have grown up in care. I went into care when I was  and while that meant I was saved from the neglect that I lived in, it also meant spending the rest of my childhood surrounded by legal processes and professionalism.I had staff, not parents. I lived in a unit, not a home. I was physically restrained by the people who looked after me when it was deemed I wasnrsquot being compliant. I was part of routine conversations about whether it was a good idea for me to live in the same place as my brother, even though he was the only person who understood my le.I hear versions of this still,  years on, compounded by the fact that young people still donrsquot have the right to independent advocacy in legal meetings where enormous decisions are made about their le. Hope has, for many, felt like something hard to find in . I have felt like a bit of an anomaly this year because I have relished political conversations.Having spent the year campaigning and speaking to politicians from every party, I know that while there are fundamental disagreements about our constitutional make-up, there is political will to do something dferent for care experienced people. I believe that our politicians want something revolutionary to happen for those are or have been looked after by the state. \"Erin McAuley, ldquoA lot of our lives are very precarious. Although therersquos a lot more opportunity therersquos little security or stability. A lot of the jobs that young people are facing are insecure or are short-term contracts or are not well paid in comparison to the standard of living.It seems to be that therersquos a whole chunk of young people in Britain who are stuck in this precarious cycle of high rents and insecure work, low pay. That includes students. Irsquove qualied as a teacher recently, but to sustain myself at uni Irsquove worked all my four years. Irsquom in retail now, on a short-term contract.Itrsquos not unusual for young people to be in and out of short-term contracts. And something that frustrates me in work is that Irsquom doing exactly the same work as maybe my colleague younger than me or my colleague older than me, but wersquore all getting a dferent pay based on our age. Thatrsquos something that shouldnrsquot be happening.Irsquom chair of the Unite Youth Committee. Within that committee our three big things are the pay disparity among young people, mental health and rent. If I could wave a wand in , I would have something done about the price of housing, whether thatrsquos through rent caps or more social housing. But also I would change the world of work, and not have any zero-hour contracts and have wages that people feel they can sustain themselves on.Mental health is another thing that I would want to solve. There is a mental ill health epidemic and no wonder, given wersquove got an insecure job market, and insecure housing, plus so much more pressure on young people, with Instagram and twitter, to feel validated.Irsquove always campaigned for mental health services, partly because of my own experiences. I went to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicewhen I was  but then I got moved straight to the adult service because there was not a young adult service, and it was just a long waiting list. My magic wand for Scotland for mental health would be to bring in a - service.Bryn Evans, ldquoThe thing I most worry about to do with the world right now is Brexit. When the referendum happened, I was hopeful that the vote would go towards Remain so when it got announced that we were going to leave, it shocked me.A few of my friends are from a iety of dferent European countries and they are not scared but worried for their future in this country. I think some are just going to leave Scotland and not come back.The two things I would most hope to happen in  are Brexit not happening or Trump being put out of power."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  MPs should come back from their constituencies and prepare for coalition","story":"But this New Year theres only one forecast that really matters: what will happen with Brexit  As in a war, Brexit will crowd everything off the political agenda in . Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker.

Headline: Scene in house described.\"Benny Lynch, former Flyweight Champion of the world, was fined pound at Hamilton today for assault.\"He was found Guilty of assaulting his we, -years-old sister-in-law, and three police constables.\"Mrs Lynch, who is , was informed that she was not obliged to testy against her husband, but elected to do so.\"She said she had been separated from him for six weeks, but ed to him on February .\"There was a dispute, and he went out, ing at night.\"When she was at home with her son and sister, Mrs Lynch said he came in \"screaming and shouting.\"\"He said to her, \"Get out of this house,\" and kicked her on the back.\"Saying, \"I will show you,\" Lynch, she declared, took the baby into the kitchen and held him over the gas stove, declaring: \"Ill gas him.\"\"When she attempted to get the baby, her husband kicked her on the legs.\"Mrs Lynch, who was under the stress of great emotion, stated that her husband put the baby on the floor and said: \"Look at him - hes dizzy.\"\"He then got her by the ears and hair and, when her sister tried to push him away, he turned and kicked the sister.\"Tears streamed down Mrs Lynchs face as she was cross-examined, and she was allowed to be seated.\"Lynch was drunk during the attack and, on arrival at the police station, said he couldnt remember what had happened.The Staffordshire Sentinel court report goes on to give the response of Lynchs defence lawyer, adding: \"[Lynch] had been making a real struggle to get fit again and felt ashamed that he, who could control himself in the ring better than anyone in the world, should be unable to control himself in his own home.\"[The lawyer] had been asked to contest strongly that Lynch, who loved his children, should be charged with the offence relating to the baby.\"The Statue for Benny campaign worked with Glasgow Le, which runs the citys museum and sport centres, to develop an exhibition about the boxer, which ended up travelling around the city for three years.Open Museum outreach assistant Kevin Kerrigan curated the display, which, after dozens of people came forward to donate Benny Lynch-related objects, ended up with a larger space in the Peoples Palace museum.\"The group wanted to tell a more positive story about Benny Lynch but I was always very clear that any exhibition would have to be balanced, it would have to contain both sides of the story,\" said Kerrigan.\"And it does go into quite a lot of detail about his alcoholism but next to that are the very positive things, his gloves and his trophies. It showcases his achievements.\"He achieved a lot in his career but his downfall was alcohol, that fed into his convictions - such as for drink driving.\"For Kerrigan, who is writing a book called Finding Benny, Lynch is a tragic, complex figure who the city should be proud of.\"There is no excuse for [domestic violence] but there can be causes,\" he adds.\"He has no convictions from before . If you want to look for a cause [drink] is one of them.\"Every single one of the newspaper reports mention that he was intoxicated. He was a flawed character.\"We are reframing things based on todays social norms and taking these incidents as standalone events then yes, we have to condemn them.\"But there wasnt the help then that there is now.\"Benny Lynch didnt get a second chance to recover or recant. All the problems in his le killed him. He died.\"Marsha Scott, chief executive of Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, would disagree. \"In the same breath as we often hear that there is no excuse for domestic abuse, we also hear that it is by and large the fault of alcohol, mental health, poverty, fame, or in historical cases ndash the product of a society with dferent morals to those we have now,\" she said.\"Those conveniently forgotten in this discourse are of course victim-survivors, the women who experience pain ndash physical and emotional ndash inflicted by abusers.\"In our view it is their strength and courage that merits celebrating, not those responsible for doing harm.\"There are records of Lynch trying to seek help for his alcoholism. He was sent to England for treatment and he would take the ferry to a monastery in Ireland to try and dry out.As Mr Kerrigan says, he \"shook it off\" but as soon as he was back in his former circles, the old problems would begin again.Under the influence of drink, Lynch racked up a slew of criminal convictions, including drink driving and child abuse.Liverpool Echo, Wednesday, October , . Headline: Benny Lynch Fined for Incident with girls in cinema\"Benny Lynch, the former world fly-weight boxing champion, was fined one guinea with the option of  days imprisonment at Govantoday for assaulting two girls, aged seven and , in a cinema.\"The circumstances are certainly odd. Lynch had gone to the cinema, to a matinee showing, and opted to sit next to a group of four very young girls.One of the children asked to move seats because she did not want to sit next to a strange man. Rather than moving, Lynch assaulted the girl.\"Lynch asked hershe was frightened and then put his arm round her neck.\"The girl began to cry, and an usherette informed the manager. Lynch then changed his seat.\"A solicitor for Lynch said the accused had had some drink.\"Men with drink were very fond of children, and a wrong construction had been put on the case.\"Lynch was only  when he died. His fame had been exceptional and his rapid decline even more so. His career was finished by  and he was dead in , dying of malnutrition induced respiratory failure.His is said to have made the equivalent of pound million in todays money but died penniless.Kerrigan said: \"Had he cleaned up his act and had the opportunity to make amends, to tell people that what he did was wrong and that he regretted it, who knows what he might have amounted to.\"Some people have the chance to redeem themselves and some dont.\"He clearly wanted to get past it. He was fighting it, he knew it was killing him and hurting him and his family.\"Whether Lynch would have recovered from his alcoholism is impossible to say, and what he would have done during recovery ndash make amends or not ndash is similarly unknowable.What we do know is that famous sportsmen are often given a free pass simply because they are talented, they generate money for their clubs and they have legions of supporters willing to overlook their abuses of power.What would a statue for Benny Lynch say about modern Glasgow \"We are erecting a statue to someone who has these dark sides and to an extent I would agree that theres a thing of celebrity where we bend light around certain people, no matter what they have done,\" Kerrigan adds.\"I think its a celebrity problem, rather than a sport problem. Film stars and actors, male and female, who have had problems with drugs and alcohol are still revered.\"The womens groups concerns are legitimate and they should be heard.\"Butyou look around the city at the statues and the artworks we have, they are not all squeaky clean characters. A lot of people from the past that we celebrate are very flawed characters and can we really judge them by modern standards \"Half of the artists in the citys collections have very colourful pasts and yet people revere them. What do we do about that \"Jimmy Boyle is revered as an artist and yet he spent time in Barlinnies Special Unit for much worse crimes ndash domestic abuse is a terrible crime ndash but this man committed murder.\"And people revere him as an artist. Do people not deserve a second chance \"For feminist groups, who have argued these points endlessly, the answer is straightforward. In Glasgow, where there are only four statues of women, a tribute to a known domestic abuser would be a backwards step.\"This yearrsquos unveiling of a statue of Mary Barbour brings the number of statues of women in Glasgow up to a grand total of four,\" a spokeswoman for Engender said.\"Despite this underrepresentation, the latest calls for a new statue for the city are for yet another man, this time commemorating boxer Benny Lynch.\"But as well as being held up by some as the one of the greatest flyweights in boxing history, Lynch was a known abuser convicted of assaulting his estranged we in , and of assaulting two young girls in a Glasgow cinema three years later.\"Yet read any of the ious articles about Lynch, or the calls for him to be commemorated in film or stone, and these facts will be mysteriously missing.\"References which do exist to his alcoholism and a troubled past only serve to perpetuate myths about domestic abuse, and gloss over Lynchrsquos violence against women.\"This is yet another example of a manrsquos sporting abilities erasing their abuse towards women.\"In the year where we saw #MeToo shine a light on the sexual harassment and assault being carried out by men in positions of power, we would hope that a man convicted of assault, no matter how good he was at winning in the ring, was not worthy of being commemorated in Scotlandrsquos cities.\"Bennys son, Bobby, said: \"My fathers story was one of a human being who defied the odds to become a world famous sportsman.\"It was in a time when there was no support for those in his position, there was a depression, two wars and alcohol was a blight on society.\"It wasnrsquot an excuse, but Benny achieved so much and brought so much joy in such a dark time.\"My mother recalled her time with him fondly and itrsquos such a shame he didnrsquot have the opportunity to pull himself out of his dark times as many with the right support and help can do.\"As a family, we have always hoped that his achievements are always at the forefront and itrsquos only now that we are really celebrating what he achieved.\"For many years the public poured over his sad last days and we hope to move on from that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"young-turning-backs-on-auld-lang-syne-say-researchers","story":"The next generation are more likely to let old anthems be forgotten, according to Deezer, which says its statistics show Auld Lang Syne is not a Hogmanay hit with younger listeners.\"We two have paddled in the stream\" is the English translation of the opening line of Robert Burns fourth verse, but online streaming data shows that the traditional ballad is losing popularity, with mainly older generations still listening.The song, based on the Rabbie Burns poem, was the most-played track in the ten minutes between .pm on New Years Eve  and .am on January  this year, according to the streaming service.However, the hymn to the passing of the old year may be a tradition that is lost on a new generation, with  to -year-old listeners making up only  per cent of those streaming on Hogmanay.

This, after three years of everyone being told by David Cameron and everyone , including Theresa May, the Prime Minister for all her years in the job that it would be final. Not a single voice in any newspaper or anywhere  in the media, in all that time, has ever suggested that the democratic will of the people was only advisory, to be rejected by the House of Commonsit wished. These papers referred to have no credence, no validity, no force, for they have been over-ridden by the repeated statements of the referendum vote being sacrosanct by the current Prime Minister and her predecessor and accepted as such by everyone. Other papers have doubtless been omitted. That is how desperate the losers are to recover their position.Many have objected that the decision was wrong, but that it was the will of the people has been accepted for three years before the vote was ever held. These letters advancing the case of the referendum are the last-ditch defence of people who think they know better than the will of the people of the country. That arrogance has been demolished many times these last three years.We must leave and we must do so with honour. We must control our manner of leaving and not be bullied by the EU.

For a start, the gorge is ft deep which means the only way to get at the ldquonon-native species ndash Japanese knotweed and rhododendron ponticum ndash is to abseil down. The abseilers then have to identy where the plants are and spray them with weed-killer. Even the trust admits itrsquos pretty extreme stuff, but this is the point wersquore at now. In fact, the people working to eradicate ldquonon-native species see operations such as the one at Corrieshalloch as a ldquowar or ldquobattle against an ldquoinvasion or ldquoswarm. Those are the words they use. The defenders of our apparently native plants talk like theyrsquore on a battlefield or in a B-movie. And no-one laughs.However, I think now is the time to start questioning the orthodoxy,only to save us from more hyperbole. The narrative of the National Trust, and other organisations ndash backed by the Scottish and UK Governments ndash is that ldquonon-native species cost millions of pounds and that they must be eradicated to protect the ldquonative ones, even though their argument defies common sense, the history of the planet and the evolution of plants and animals. A fir tree or a grey squirrel doesnrsquot know where the border between two countries is, and nor should they, because the ision between native and non-native, like borders, is entirely man-made.The rhododendron ponticum that the National Trust wants to eradicate from Corrieshalloch is a good example. The plant has had all kinds of UKIP-style rhetoric thrown at it over the yearsand itrsquos mainly because, according to its detractors, it spreads fast and prevents other plants from growing. James Fenton, an ecologist who has worked for the National Trust, has even suggested thatwe took no action to control the plant and came back in a thousand years, the landscape of Scotland would be just one dark rhododendron forest.But could I stick up for the rhododendron ponticum, based on what the plant actually does  Itrsquos true that it thrives in certain types of soil, but it is no more or less likely to spread than ivy or bracken. The dference, of course, between bracken and rhododendron ponticum is that one is considered native and the other non-native even though rhododendron ponticum was certainly in this part of the world before the last Ice Age and was then reintroduced to Britain from seeds  years ago. How long does a plant have to be here before it is considered native The idea that rhododendron ponticum would spread ad infinitum is also flawed ndash thatrsquos just not how nature works. For example, the Americans used to get hysterical about the purple loosestre plant, which was accused of the same crime as rhododendron ponticum ndash reducing ersity ndash but the long-term evidence was dferent: there was a first wave of the plant, then it declined, and the natural ersity reasserted itself. With the exception of very small islands, this is what new species in an area do: they increase ersity rather than reduce it.The search for a scientic definition of ldquonon-native does not help either because there isnrsquot one. In fact, the whole idea of native and non-native was pretty much invented by Victorian botanists like Hewitt Watson, although no one has ever really been able to agree what the words mean. Should we go back to some kind of year zero ndashbut then how far back would you go  Andyou go too far back, you reach a point where the world was one great continent anyway and every plant and animal could spread and roam freely.Some attempts to define native and non-native are based on whether there has been human intervention, which is the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach, but this is also far from consistent. There is a widely-held view, for example, that grey squirrelsare non-native and should be culled, but why arenrsquot we seeking to eradicate other species that have been introduced such as the common pheasant  And what about the collared dove  Why spend money on measures to control the grey squirreland nothing on the collared dove, which has only been around in the UK since the s but is presumably competing with ldquonative birds for food It is this kind of inconsistency that makes a mockery of the whole native non-native ision and the National Trust for Scotlandrsquos operation at Corrieshalloch Gorge. Letrsquos deal with facts instead. Such as this one: plants and animals are not harmful just because they were introduced by humans, nor are they necessarily good for bioersity because they werenrsquot.And this fact: there are much greater environmental threats than the spread of ldquonon-native species, such as plastic and other types of waste, intensive farming, and industrial pollution - all of which are linked to the most dangerous native of all: humans.And then therersquos this fact: our ecology is changing all the time, animals and plants come and go, they thrive, fade, spread, fall back and rise again, and therersquos no reason why a erse and healthy environment of the future canrsquot include so-called non-native species. In fact, do you think that in a thousand years the petty definitions that are driving us to the bottom of gorges with weedkiller will matter  Our ecology will have moved on. There may not even be a Scotland or any other border by which to define our species. And the best thing about that  The plants and the animals will just get on with it anyway. They wonrsquot even notice."},{"url":null,"title":"year-in-review-looking-back-at-a-bruising-2018","story":"It brought us Cuba without a Castro at the helm and Cambridge Analytica out of the shadows.In France the prevailing political colour was yellow, while across Yemen starvation remained an added predator in a war in which children were increasingly the victims.In all,  globally was a bruising year for the optimists and one that began and ends with a shutdown of the US government as Donald Trump the man who dominated the yearrsquos headlines continues to make them.As one New York Times headline put it earlier this month, for Mr Trump itrsquos ldquo a war every day, waged increasingly alone.That much was evident at yearrsquos end as US Defence Secretary James Mattis, the man many regarded as the ldquolast adult in the room of Mr Trumprsquos White House resigned over the Presidentrsquos abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan.As the New Year looms the US federal government is expected to remain partially closed in a protracted standoff over Mr Trumprsquos demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico.For many in Washington this parting shot of  and the standoff and political acrimony created is just another ominous portent of things to come in , a year in which the President will come under unprecedented pressure as legal investigations pile up around him.Looking back on  the US mid-term elections might just have marked the beginning of the end of Donald Trumprsquo presidency, but only time will tell.Overall Americans must have done a lot of soul searching last year as their country remained a fractured place and the scourge of another shooting took its toll on civilians in Parkland Florida.Elsewhere in the world it was no less turbulent as Moscow under Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly made its stamp on the global stage. Who can forget that wink from the Russian leader to his US counterpart at the start of the Helsinki summit  Who was not flabbergasted that Mr Trump then went on to side with Russia against the FBI over claims of interference in the  presidential election Both men are not known for being well disposed towards a free and unfettered media and last year was one in which threats to press freedom reached a new high.The brutal killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a chilling reminder of what media watchdog Reporters Without Bordersdescribed in wider terms as hatred whipped up by ldquounscrupulous politicians.Mr Khashoggirsquos murder shocked the world and put the country, and its young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under closer international scrutiny.If there is an upside to this terrible story itrsquos that perhaps at least it helped bring pressure on Riyadh over its prosecution of the Saudi led coalition war in Yemen.This month ldquomilestone peace talks began in Sweden and the hope is they will help bring about an end to a war that has resulted in  million people or half of Yemenrsquos population now needing aid to survive.But Yemen is not the only place in  that saw humanitarian agencies placed under enormous pressure. As I write Indonesia again reels from a deadly tsunami, an eerie reminder of the terrible Boxing Day disaster back in .In Democratic Republic of Congo too an Ebola epidemic that has taken grip is itself a devastating repeat of a similar outbreak in West Africa in .In the Middle East so often a crucible of suffering there was some good news as Iraqi voters flocked to the polls in  for the first time since driving out the Islamic Stategroup in  after the Iraq civil war.It was signicant election for the country as Iraqis were given the power to decide their future with the potential to sht the balance of power and mend isions between ethnic groups.That said, the jihadists of IS continued to pose a considerable threat in  with many analysts suggesting they were reconstituting their forces and establishing a network of cells to pursue a guerrilla insurgency both in Iraq and neighbouring Syria.Elsewhere around the world Islamist-inspired terror cast its shadow. In Europe, France once again bore the brunt, most recently when -year-old Cher Chekatt, armed with a gun and kne near Strasbourgrsquos famed Christmas market killed two and injured another  people.The terror attack came at what was already a turbulent moment for France as one of the yearrsquos most ldquovisible political phenomena, the gilets jaunes or yellow vest movement took to the streets in a challenge to French President Emmanuel Macron.Ugly as the scenes in Paris have been, in terms of international stories this past year, the gilets jaunes protests against what they see as financial exploitation by the Francersquos privileged metropolitan elite, captured the imagination of many around the world.It was a year also in which we witnessed a backlash against big tech. More people in  have access to the internet than safe drinking water.But as the worldrsquos digital population continues to grow there are fears not everyone is reaping the so-called ldquodigital idends of this transformation.The story of how researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to  million people before sharing some of it with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in our digital online age. Perhaps refreshing then to recall that heroic story earlier in  in which a team of young football players and their coach survived for  days before being extracted by cave rescue ers inThailand.Tragic as the death of one courageous rescuer was, how unusual it was to follow a story with a largely happy ending. Rare also to have one that caught the imagination and universal concern of people in a world otherwise riven with ision.Yes, all in all  was a bruising year for the worldrsquos optimists. But letrsquos not give up looking on the bright side.Perhaps, just perhaps,  might finally be the year when that ultimate hogger of headlines, Donald Trump, finally gets his comeuppance as special counsel Robert Muellerrsquos probe finally bears down.A Happy New Year to everyone when it comes."},{"url":null,"title":"review-the-filthy-tongues-liquid-rooms-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"The Filthy TonguesThe Liquid Rooms, EdinburghNeil CooperFour starsThe mini spotlight attached to Martin Metcalfersquos microphone lights up the Filthy Tonguesrsquo vocalistrsquos face with a celestial glow that casts even more shadows on an otherwise black-swathed stage.

Arguably, it was the first such year for a decade, given  was so dominated by the independence fight.It showed. The SNP lacked its usual dynamo.The absence of a campaign put the spotlight on to its record rather than its aspirations, and demonstrated why the First Minister and other politicians love a good contest.Making promises is so much easier than keeping them.After years in door-knocking mode, the SNP ranks got antsy. Where was the referendum they had been promised  Surely Ms Sturgeonrsquos talk of a ldquotriple lock mandate the previous year wasnrsquot just a piece of rhetorical thistledown Troubled by the listlessness at the top, the Yes movement took it on itself to organise.A series of marches organised by the All Under One Banner group brought tens of thousands on to the streets of cities around Scotland through the spring and summer.In the SNP deputy leadership race, Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny stood on an explicit  of a second referendum in .His rivals felt compelled to talk up the prospect of another vote too, although they were more circumspect about dates.Nor did the partyrsquos long-lost Growth Commission allay activist jitters when it finally appeared.Andrew Wilsonrsquos revised economic blueprint for independence was more curds and vinegar than milk and honey. The left of the party baulked at its hairshirt focus on deficit reduction and its plan to keep sterling.More tensions bubbled to the surface at the SNPrsquos October conference, with MP Angus Macneil telling his party not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby when they gave up their march on London.Other MPs suggested independence might arrive via an unidentied ldquodemocratic event rather than a referendum, given Theresa May refused to grant the latter.It was hardly a schism, but such shows of frustration and doubt with the leadership are rare in the modern SNP.Citing the delays and muddleover Brexit, the First Minister backed away from her pledge to give a ldquoprecise timescale for Indyref in the autumn, kicking her announcement into the New Year - for now - and making a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit her priority, even though another EU referendum would not leave enough time for a new independence vote before .By December, even Alex Salmond was questioning his successorrsquos appetite for a second referendum, wondering on his RT TV showthe ldquoCaledonian leboat would ever be launched.The former first minister was a key part of the SNPrsquos grim year. In January, two female civil servants made sexual misconduct complaints against him relating to .It would be another seven months, after an investigation overseen by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, that their existence would enter the public domain.When they did, the effect was explosive. Furious at the way the case had been handled, Mr Salmond launched a judicial review against the government he once led and quit the SNP after  years as a member,  as its leader, to spare it ldquointernal ision.It took him barely three days to crowdsource pound, to pay for the legal action.Ms Sturgeon publicly backed Ms Evans. Battle lines were drawn. Mr Salmond reportedly refers to his former protegee as Lady Macbeth and is gunning for one of her key aides.When the judicial review hearing starts at the Court of Session two weeks today, Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeonrsquos government will play for keeps. A polarising fight could see SNP members take sides. It is a moment the party should dread.The reorganisation of income tax into five bands, albeit under pressure from the Scottish Greens, was another bold change. Derek Mackayrsquos decision not to copy Tory tax cuts in England and Wales for the wealthy has continued the experiment, despite flak about a cross-border tax gap.But in education, Ms Sturgeonrsquos top priority, and in health, which consumes almost half the Scottish revenue budget, the Governmentrsquos record has been lamentable.There is no expectation that NHS waiting time or treatment targets will be hit any more. When the monthly stats come out, the only question is how badly they will be missed.Demonstrating how much tougher it is to run a delivery department than shuffle money, former finance secretary John Swinney has toiled in the education brief.In June, he was forced to halt his flagship school reform bill because of a lack of support. To give him cover for this woeful climbdown, Ms Sturgeon reshuffled her Cabinet the same day, getting shot of Shona Robison from health and Keith Brown from economy.But the excitement at the promotion of a new generation of ministers didnrsquot last long. In a blog written long before she became an MSP, Gillian Martin had written about ldquohairy knuckled, lipstick-wearing transgender laydees.Despite its existence being reported in , no one in government read it for the reshuffle. Ms Martin became the mayfly minister, in charge of higher education for a day, then gone. Ms Sturgeonrsquos judgment was put under the microscope and found wanting.Mr Swinney was also humiliated by MSPs voting against standardised testing for P pupils, and by some councils refusing to implement it.The first teachersrsquo strike in a generation is looming over pay.But as Ms Sturgeonrsquos deputy, he remains unsackable.At health, Jeane Freeman has come clean about problems she has inherited, writing off pound million of emergency loans to health boards they canrsquot repay and admitting ldquolegally binding waiting time guarantees will be missed until .However Audit Scotland continues to warn of cash problems in health as well as across local government, where reserves are being run down to an alarming degree.Itrsquos been no picnic on the railways either, with ScotRailrsquos performance hitting record lows, and Transport Secretary Michael Matheson impotently huffing and puffing at the franchise holder Abellio.Worse, he waived sanctions for their lousy service after accepting much of the blame lay with Network Rail, which is owned by the UK Government. The SNPrsquos plan to merge British Transport Police and Police Scotland north of the Border was aborted.As with much of Brexit, the fights of a few months ago, so intense at the time, seem dim and distant. In the spring, Ms Sturgeon and Michael Russell led a cross-party Continuity Bill through Holyrood to avoid a lsquopower grabrsquo of devolved competencies.But the Supreme Court effectively gutted it after a challenge by the UK government delayed its Royal Assent and allowed Westminsterrsquos EU Withdrawal Act to supersede it.Mr Russell also threatened to gum up the constitutional works by withholding consent for any Brexit-related Bill that came to Holyrood under the Sewel convention, then quietly backed down in the face of a Bill that was needed to give Scots health cover after Brexit.Despite all that, Ms Sturgeon remains a top-flight politician.In the last year, she has successfully portrayed Scotland as a beacon of stability amid the roiling chaos of Brexit. Her attacks on Jeremy Corbyn for vacillating over the biggest political issue in a generation have struck home. Her early emphasis on customs and single market continuity has been adopted by other parties.But turning the calendar on  will not put her problems behind her. The SNPrsquos basic plan in government ndash keep things simmering along inoffensively until therersquos a Yes vote ndash looks uninspiring and timid, even in its own ranks.Brexit also seems to have given voters their fill of constitutional upheaval. There is little appetite for a second independence referendum.The weary ldquowill she, wonrsquot she dance about the timing of another vote is likely to reach its anti-climax soon.If there is no general election or Peoplersquos Vote in , the focus on Scotlandrsquos public services will intensy, and it will not be to the SNPrsquos advantage. Mr Salmondrsquos day in court is nigh. The police continue their investigations.Any party in power as long as the SNP is self-evidently a ldquomature government.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Itrsquos a sad reflection on society, I feel.ldquoWe ought to be very thankful that wersquore free, because thatrsquos what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnrsquot be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.ldquoIt was all for a cause. People may say, lsquoOh, thatrsquos patriotic nonsense.rsquo But it isnrsquot.This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OrsquoGroat Journal of June , .Monday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118591.jpg","title":"Just the ticket for tackling debt","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointTHE Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what the organisations are.* For more information, visit www.creditunions.scotMonday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings. However, more recently windows on the higher first floor were also damaged. Vandalism of council property is a complete waste of council tax payers money as it erts council staff away from delivering the essential services that are required.\"Monday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118857.jpg","title":"Racetrack plan for Caithness","story":"A RACETRACK is set to be established in Caithness within the next three years which could host a stage of motorsports British Sprint Championship as well as motorcycle races.It could also be used for a range of other activities, including kart racing, mountain biking and archery, as well as being a music venue.Caithness Car Club and the Caithness Autocross Club have set up a steering group to drive the initiative forward.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As we enter  and the final countdown to Brexit, I share the sense of deep frustration felt by many.Anger with a Tory Prime Minister who is dragging the UK towards a clf edge with the hardline Brexiteers who don’t care about the impact on workers and with the leader of my own party who is prepared to facilitate a reckless withdrawal from the EU.That Brexit will deliver economic hardship for our country is beyond doubt. It is constitutional vandalism of the very worst kind, which will hit the poorest the hardest.Shame on those who are unwilling to stand up for the communities in the firing line. Your actions will not be forgotten.But there is another emotion as well: sadness.By the end of March, we are destined to walk away from the most important peace process the modern world has ever seen.It will decimate opportunity for the next generation, and send a signal to the world that we no longer believe in cooperation and togetherness, and instead we stand for isolationism and nationalism.I believe in solidarity and the breaking down of borders. That’s why I oppose both Scottish independence and Brexit. As the words on the back of my Labour membership card state – “by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone” – words that Jeremy Corbyn should reflect upon.I am Scottish, British and European, and Brexit is not going to take that away from me.But it is going to take away the opportunities that come with being part of the European Union.Over  years as an MEP, I have witnessed the EU expand and reform to bring nations closer together in the interests of co-operation and peace.The expansion that delivered membership to countries like Poland and Romania was a success that brought huge idends for those nations as well as our own.The economic contribution of EU migrants to Britain is beyond question. That so many workers, who pay their taxes and help run our vital services, such as the NHS, are already leaving our shores is a tragedy.They have not only contributed to our economy, but also to our society. They are our neighbours, our work colleagues and our friends. If you are having trouble finding a job, getting a house, or seeing your doctor, it’s not caused by your Polish next door neighbours, it’s caused by the Tories’ austerity ideology.That my own party also wants to end freedom of movement is deeply distressing for me.We should be shouting from the rooftops about the unions of people and nations, and how we can use their collective power for the common good. That’s at the very heart of what it means – or what it should mean – to be Labour.But I worry too about the impact of Brexit on British citizens who have enjoyed the freedom to travel across the EU unhindered. The youngsters who have been offered the opportunity to fall in love with European cities, European culture and European people.The Brits who have made their homes in France, Spain and Ireland, often to enjoy a well-deserved retirement, or the students who have taken advantage of the Erasmus programme to broaden their horizons.As a young woman myself, aged just , in  I became the UK’s youngest MEP.I have witnessed major EU reforms that have transformed our lives, such as lower credit card fees, clearer labelling on food products and the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges.I have used my voice as a representative of voters in Scotland to help build a fairer society.So yes, I am angry that we are putting further development at risk. But, when the clock strikes pm on  March, it will largely be sadness that I feel.Sadness for those who will miss out on the opportunities we have today sadness for my friends across Europe and sadness that we are led by politicians who are willing to tear apart the bonds of solidarity that mean so much to so many people.Catherine Stihler is Labour MEP for Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849531.1546007236!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan 2019 predictions likely to be less crazy than reality","story":"No-one knows what will happen next year, so guess away # the truth is likely to be stranger than fiction, says John McLellanFilling newspapers at Twixtmas, as we must now refer to the week separating Christmas and New Year, is a pain all those reviews of last year and wild predictions for the one to come because nothing’s happening.At HQ the holiday cover just wants something, anything to fill the space. And early, please. The trade secret is what is known in politics as the Christmas Box a folio of previously prepared stories from press teams under day-by-day embargo drip-fed to tide the papers over until proper news starts happening again.Without Christmas Boxes, the news agenda would just be a diet of the day’s emergencies, the aftermath of drunken violence and the Old Firm. A bit like BBC Scotland every weekend.This year it’s much, much easier. No-one, not the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the First Minister, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch of Constantinople or Richard Dawkins has any idea what’s going to happen in British or European politics next week, never mind next year, so commentators can speculate away in the knowledge that reality will be crazier than any guess.My punt is the Prime Minister’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement for leaving the EU will win the day but onlyshe follows the advice to narrow down the options. There is no parliamentary majority for any of the possible pathways and despite talk of Norway or Canada Plus, it might as well be Norwegian Wood or Canada Dry for all the attention the EU is paying. The options come down to a second in-or-out referendum, the draft deal or a no-deal departure.As the government is committed to the meaningful vote by  January, the first move onfrom recess a week on Monday should be to force a vote over a second referendum. With Jeremy Corbyn committed to Brexit it’s a vote the government should win, which would leave the draft withdrawal and a no deal departure which the majority also oppose. Game, set and match, Mrs May.But having gambled with General Election odds in her favour and lost heavily, will Mrs May gamble again  With advice from the level-headed David Liddington, I’m not betting against it. VA envyEnterprising iniduals can make their own headlines, as Edinburgh Labour leader Cammy Day has done with his views on the Dundee VA and how Edinburgh should be following suit. What caught the eye, on Tayside certainly, was Cllr Day’s rejoinder that “ bloody Dundee can get a VA, then the capital city wants something even better”. Somewhat more diplomatically, bloody Dundee councillor Lynne Short responded calmly: “It is goodwe are inspiring other towns and cities.”Happily, now working on what could be Edinburgh’s answer to the VA is award-winning Scottish architect John McAslan whose catalogue of major international works includes London King’s Cross Station. Typically in his game there has been the odd political scuffle, most notably his shelved plans for Glasgow’s George Square.His practice has been working on the £m Granton collections centre for the National Galleries of Scotland and ever-helpful Cllr Day chipped in: “What we don’t want is a big storage container. We want a VA, we want something that’s quite iconic. If that’s not what’s coming forward then we are not interested.” “Quite iconic  How quite iconic would you like it, sir,” might not be Mr McAslan’s immediate reaction, but the point about a focal point for the new district is reasonable. I could hardly argue, given I made the same point in June after a sneak preview of the VA. “Siting anything like the VA in or around Edinburgh city centre would cause uproar, but put it on the seafront in Granton and it might have a similar effect as it’s having in Dundee,” I wrote. The problem with iconic, as the saga of the ten-times-over-budget £m Scottish Parliament building demonstrated, is cost. The Dundee VA is only about the same size as the Holyrood debating chamber alone and from £m ended up costing just over £m. Not quite iconicIconic is not a word often used to describe Meadowbank Stadium. Controversial or crumbling certainly, historic to an extent but symbolic not so much, not in architectural terms anyway.But the ious schemes to replace the Commonwealth Games complex have come to symbolise bitter cynicism about local decision-makingand a deep disenchantment with Edinburgh Council.For all its shortcomings, the stadium gave the district a sense of identity which the new sports centre will struggle to match.A new animated ‘fly-through’ of the replacement centre has just been released by the council, revealing a perfectly al regional sports centre, but to borrow from Cllr Day, it’s not quite iconic. Maybe the reality will be more impressive, but it doesn’t look like much for £m, certainly not the underwhelming -seat spectator area which is supposed to be a new home for Third Division high-flyers Edinburgh City.There is no sound business case for the council to build and maintain an international athletics stadium which would be needed about once every two years. If a millionaire track and field fan came forward then maybe it could be dferent, but the last time a supposed tycoon flashed his wallet around Meadowbank it didn’t end well. But the new images will do little to quell the feeling the area has been short-changed.Progress prediction nilNew Meadowbank is due to open in  and approximately  months later voters get a chance to pass judgment on their councillors at the  local elections. So in the spirit of all those Twixtmas space-fillers, here are a few predictions for Scotland’s capital in  after ten years of SNP-Labour coalitions: the Newhaven tram completion will not have taken its first fare-paying customer, the huge new Granton estate will not have risen from the old gasworks site, the South Suburban rail line’s only service will still be freight and the airport International Business Gateway will still be a field. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118827.jpg","title":"Bundle of joy ready for delivery","story":"THERE will be an early Christmas present for new mums and dads on low incomes across Scotland but the good news does not stop there...The first Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment will be made before the big day, it was confirmed, after applications opened on Monday.The payment will see eligible applicants receive pound for their first child, pound more than the DWP Sure Start Maternity Grant it replaces.The Best Start Grant also provides pound for all subsequent children ndash meaning there is no cap on the number of children it supports, unlike the current UK government equivalent.In addition, two additional early years payments will be introduced by next summer.The first pound payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further pound when they start school.Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \"I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support.\"I am particularly pleased that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister and had no support from the UK government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.\"With the Early Learning and School Age Payments this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide pound to pound more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.\"Thats a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this governments emphasis on the early years.\"Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK government which was recently criticised by the United Nations Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts are causing.\"bull The benefit will be wholly delivered by Social Security Scotland.bull Parents carers will be eligiblethey are the mother of the child, her partner, or have a young mother dependent on them.bull The benefits which qualy include Universal Credit, Income Support, Income-based Jobseekers Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit.bull Recipients do not have to be on a qualying benefitunder  or are  or  and in full-time education and still dependent on parent or carer.Monday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118880.jpg","title":"Collars to keep up with Dasher","story":"Gavin MusgroveLOOKING out for reindeer is usually reserved for children on Christmas Eve.But now researchers at the University of the Highlands and Islands are using cutting-edge GPS camera collars to find out more about the whereabouts and behaviour of the animals in the Cairngorms.The study forms part of a new research programme designed to inform future sustainable reindeer tourism in the national park.Inverness College UHI, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, is leading on the Cairngorms Reindeer Research Programme and the Glenmore-based Cairngorm Reindeer Company is involved too.It is investigating the ecological role reindeer play in the Cairngorms, focusing on their movements, behaviour and diet, as well as investigating what attitudes and values people hold about the animals.Dr Louise de Raad, Inverness College UHI research fellow, said: \"This area contains some of the finest forests and mountain habitats in Britain and landowners are seeking to maximise the restoration and expansion of these areas.\"We know the reindeer are a key visitor attraction but despite being present for more than  years we know very little about their impact on the area.\"Studying their feeding and ranging behaviour will be a first step towards understanding their impact.\"This will help us make recommendations to ensure that the herd is managed sustainably and continues to make a positive contribution to the area.\"Reindeer were reintroduced to Scotland in  by Swedish herder Mikel Utsi, and they have done well since.

ice and presents filled with his favourite treats.\"Our mischievous cub has grown so much since he took his first steps outside in March and is rapidly catching up to his mum, Victoria, although he still has some way to go until he reaches his full adult size, as male polar bears can weigh up to  kilogrammes.\"In the wild, polar bear cubs will stay with their mothers for two to three years, learning key survival skills before leaving to start their own families.When Hamish is ready to leave Victoria, it is hoped he will play a role in the European endangered species breeding programme.Barbara Smith, chief executive of park owners the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: \"Hamishs arrival has helped us to highlight the threats that many wild animals are facing and the small changes we can make to really make a big dference.\"As a wildle conservation charity, we believe we have a duty to help protect this magnicent species which is predicted to signicantly

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745500.1545401332!/image/image.jpg","title":"galgorm resort and spa evacuated","story":"Galgorm Resort and Spa has ed to business as usual after an evacuation earlier this afternoon.The hotel was evactuated as a precaution following a small electrical fire, which had been dealt with by staff by the time the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service had arrived at the scene, a fire service spokesperson said.Galgorm Resort and Spa.Victoria Brown, marketing manager at Galgorm Resort and Spa, said: “As a precautionary measure we evactuated the resort this afternoon following an incident whereby smoke was seen coming from a ceiling .

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They make themselves look foolish when they do so.\"We will extend understanding to our colleague Jacob on this occasion and hope that when he visits he will accept our invitation for a cup of tea so that we can discuss with him the important political issues facing Northern Ireland in  in detail\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36925071.ece/d9006/AUTOCROP/w620/Harry_meghan_wedding_007.jpg","title":"most read stories of 2018 bread brexit backstops and the cream horns of the","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Set in the Troubles during the s, it went up against  other titles to win the accolade, which brings a £, award. It tells the story of sexual coercion in a controlling society from the point of view of a young female protagonist.As of last month, the novel had sold a total of , copies. Arlene Foster ARLENE FOSTER was also the year that the province ed to prominence in the political arena thanks to Brexit - primarily due to the thorny question of the border.The isive issue has split not only this place, but the whole of the UK.Regardless of the opposing positions, DUP leader Arlene Foster found herself in the national spotlight in , remaining steadfast in opposition to Prime Minister Theresa Mays concerted efforts to push through her Brexit deal with its controversial border backstop clause.Although  may herald tricky times for Mrs Foster once the Renewable Heat Incentive Inquiry publishes its findings, there is no denying she and the DUPs  MPs have played an influential role in shaping the unfolding Brexit drama.Jacob Stockdale  JACOB STOCKDALEThe past  months have been a whirlwind for the Ulster and Ireland rugby ace, named  BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality of the Year.The talented winger took the title despite stf competition from four-time World Superbike champion Jonathan Rea and hockey goalkeeper Ayeisha McFerran of the Ireland womens team which reached the World Cup final.It was one of many accolades for Stockdale over the past year, which included being named Six Nations player of the year after his record seven tries en route to Irelands Grand Slam win in March.An honourable mention also goes to team mate Rory Best OBE, who captained Ireland during the win against the All Blacks.Gary Lightbody GARY LIGHTBODYSnow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody made a long-awaitedin  with the bands new album and tour after a seven-year hiatus.In the intervening period between s Fallen Empires and this years Wildness, the Bangor man endured a crippling case of writers block compounded by drink and depression.Thankfully, he has conquered both to make a welcometo the stage.And the openness with which he has discussed his problems has endeared him further to fans. His journey was reflected in the latest album, a deeply personal work that delves into his fathers battle with dementia.And on the back of their recent tour, the band will play Bangors Ward Park in May.Lisa McGee LISA McGEEGiving a very dferent take on mid-s Northern Ireland is award-winning Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee, who became a well-known name in .A runaway success from the moment it made its UK debut in early January on Channel , Derry Girls and its home-grown cast were instantly embraced by comedy fans.Viewers revelled in the antics of the fantastically gobby Michelle, played by Jamie-Lee ODonnell, and the rest of her girl gang, as well as her \"wee English fella\" cousin James, played by Dylan Llewellyn, tagging along.The stakes were high for this six-part comedy series written by a largely unknown name, set in s Derry in the dying throes of the Troubles.But Channel  bosses clearly knew they were on to a good thing.A glossary guide was issued to help viewers in Britain understand our vernacular.With the second series set to air some time in , Netflix will be streaming the first series in the US, opening up the show to a wider, international audience.McGee, who has picked up accolades at the IFTA Gala TV Awards in Dublin, Edinburgh TV Festival and from the Radio Times, will find out in Januaryshe will add another win to the list by picking up Best TV Situation Comedy at the Writers Guild of Great Britain awards.Derry Girls fans have their fingers crossed.Who will stand out in  Michael Hughes MICHAEL HUGHESOne local writer to watch in  is Michael Hughes, who grew up in Keady, Co Armagh, and is now based in London.Having worked for many years as an actor under the professional name Michael Colgan, his first novel, The Countenance Divine, was published in .But it is his second literary work, Country, that has really caught the attention of critics. Using Homers Iliad as a template, Country is set in  post-ceasefire south Armagh. The shadow of the Troubles still looms large when, after a woman turns informer, an IRA gang storms the local Army base.It is Hughes ear for the local idioms that has really captured readers, with reviews declaring it \"enthralling, rigorous\", and with an execution faithful to its classical Greek counterpart.Clare Bailey CLARE BAILEYKeen to shake up local politics is self-described activist, feminist and environmentalist Clare Bailey, who took over as leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland in .Succeeding Steven Agnew, who stepped down after seven years, the MLA for South Belfast has set her sights on raising the partys profile over the next  months.

Expect to hear a lot more of her.MICHAEL CONLANAnother sportsman worthy of our attention in  is Belfast native Michael Conlan, who hasnt put a foot wrong in the boxing ring, racking up a perfect record of  professional career wins.Earlier this month he lted the IBO Intercontinental title, defeating former Commonwealth champion Jason Cunningham on the undercard of Carl Framptons clash with IBF featherweight king Josh Warrington at the Manchester Arena.The judges awarded the win to Conlan on points, although the London  Olympic bronze medallist and  World Championship gold medallist was made to work hard throughout the  rounds.

The deal she’s got is no good.“It will be very, very nerve-wracking for some people and some companies, but at the end of the day we will get a deal and it will be a better one than she has got. That’s where I think it will go and that’s what I think she should do.”Mr Davis dismissed ministers’ warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit as “scare stories”.“The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choice,” he said.“They are saying to the ones who want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you won’t get Brexit’ and to those who don’t want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you will have the worst sort of Brexit, you will have a hard crash-out’. Both these stories can’t be right.“They are trying to run the clock down.

No deal has never been viable and, as every day passes, it becomes less so.”But the Scottish National Party’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, retorted: “The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green Party are all working together to try and get a People’s Vote.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands gather for edinburghs hogmanay celebrations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong. Mr Watson, who is  and probably one of Killyleaghrsquos oldest residents, has been fighting a gruelling battle with the Housing Executive to obtain a house without stairs.At his Comber Road home Mr Watson and his  year-old we, Liza-Jane, have been tormented for a long time by problems which are easily overcome by the young, but cause massive complications for older citizens.The normally simple operation of climbing stairs is is a great task for Mrs Watson. Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy. The little foal was born two weeks ago and Gregory will now have twice as much to handle.ldquoHe has still not picked a proper name for the new addition.

Behind-the-scenes discussions are tang place in an attempt to end the monopoly of harbour facilities by the Strangford ferry and open up berths for smaller craft.Strangford, as a port of call for small boats, was virtually closed off several years ago with the expansion of the ferry service and ancillary facilities.The villagersquos past has always been linked with the harbour when an armada of small boats tied up at the harbour wall, particularly during the successful carnival days.DRUMNAQUOILE mdash Police are investigating the slaughter of three sheep and the injuring of ten others in the Drumnaquoile area.

Sinn Fein continues to veto the formation of a new Northern Ireland Executive unless we first agree to implement their narrow wish list of republican demands.“Of course there is room for a balanced agreement but it is unreasonable to expect unionists to roll over to every Sinn Fein demand.”And on the subject of Brexit she said: “We have proved in the past, we will say ‘no’ when it’s a bad deal but we will stand strong for Northern Ireland and say ‘yes’ when it’s the right deal.”Ms McDonald spoke of gay pride, the Republic’s housing crisis, and ’s centenary of the Dail.On Stormont, she said it was a “disgrace” that devolution was not working, but that “no government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP”.She said: “We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the institutions. The DUP walked away ... Sinn Fein is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.“The DUP knows what needs to be done.”Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ‘odd alliance’ with DUP criticised by NI Tories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

briefing on the emerging Northern Ireland peace process in which there were plans to tell him that the IRA was showing signs of #war-weariness#, a declassied file has revealed.The June   event was planned for over several months and involved both the then secretary of state, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and many of the most senior officials in the Northern Ireland Office and the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, David Fell.The briefing – which is the subject of its own substantial file – was to be held in the Old Admiralty Building in Whitehall and was scheduled to last for about an hour and a quarter.The file, which is among those declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast under the -Year Rule, only records preparations for the event and does not contain any material which claries what happened on the day.The heir to the throne was to be given a slide presentation which would be introduced by Sir Patrick before a series of senior NIO officials each dealt with their area of expertise.Communications with St James’ Palace about the event were classied as ‘secret and personal’, an unusually high classication.The briefing was to have initially taken place in March  but was postponed until June of that year.The material to be explained to Prince Charles stated that “PIRA’s capabilities have been eroded somewhat in recent years and there are some signs of war-weariness and declining support”.However, he was also to be told that despite that the IRA “remains dangerous, well-equipped and capable of striking at a wide range of targets”.The main threats from the IRA were described as snipers, car bombs, Mark  horizontal mortars and Mark  ‘barrack buster’ mortars.The prince was to be told that loyalist paramilitaries had been “very active in the s” but that “during much of the s they were more or less moribund”.The briefing went on: “The last - years, however, has seen a sharp resurgence in loyalist violence, reflecting in part growing anxiety in loyalist working-class areas over perceived political gain by the nationalists.“In  they were responsible for only % of terrorist murders in the past two years they have killed more people than republicans.Almost , from UK applied for Irish passport in  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“While they have made efforts to target republican activists, the great majority of victims are random sectarian murders of ordinary Catholics uninvolved in politics, mostly by close-quarter shootings.”The prince was also to be told: “It is regularly claimed that the security forces are in collusion with loyalist terrorists. In fact, the numbers of persons charged with terrorist offences demonstrates this is not the case. In the last two years, more loyalists have been charged than republicans.”The briefing contained reference to the security services’ clandestine contacts with the IRA: “On the peace side, as is now well known there has for many years been a secret means of communication with the Provisional movement.” A note in the margin described these as “longstanding but unavowed contacts whose utility required secrecy” and that as part of that communications channel an “exchange of messages followed communication from Sinn Fein in February  that ‘the conflict is over’.”A note, perhaps in anticipation of a question from the prince, said that the “messages sent were consistent with HMG’s public positions”.try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

It is the first surviving example of many such adverts taken out by spurned husbands in the s. The early News Letters are a fascinating snapshot of le in Ulster almost  years ago. The familiar names that appear could be out of a current edition of the paper.In fact, today we report on another Mr Dougherty , this time a primary school principal in Ebrington who has cause for celebration, having been awarded the MBE, rather than anxiety about paying debts run up by an estranged spouse. My use of Ulster, above, might have annoyed some people who assumed I was referring to six counties rather than nine. But I wasn’t.I used the term deliberately. There was no Northern Ireland in , and nor would there be for the better part of  years.We ran a  report this week that referred to Killibegs, which is presumably how they then spelt Killybegs in Donegal.Yet the papers in the s do not refer much to Ulster , nor to the north of Ireland.They refer to ‘this kingdom,’ which meant the kingdom of Ireland .A striking feature of early News Letters is the all Ireland reportage. See the dramatic account of the robbery of a priest in Rosscreain Co Tipperary that we reproduced this week, and is on our website .

There is more news from Monaghan than there is from Cork, and there are roughly as many reports from Dublin as there are from Scotland.There is plenty of news from the Americas, but even more from France. There is barely any from Africa, which was largely unknown, few references to China, and references to India mostly come via the Dutch East India company.Russia, however, is much in the news in , with reports from Ukraine and conflict with ‘the infidel’. Three centuries later, some global faultlines seem unchanged.Many newspapers do On This Day columns from  or  years previously, or even further back.This newspaper is perhaps the only publication in the history of papers to have been able to do a daily On This Day column from o years ago, in which we reproduce what was being reported then.This is because no daily newspaper in the English language has ever reached . There are papers that are older than us, but none is daily — most are weekly titles.There are also one or two daily papers in other languages, such a German, that are older, but we are the oldest daily in this tongue.By one classication, The Times of London is the oldest English language daily paper in the world, because while we are half a century older, it was a daily from its launch . We became a daily in the s. At first we were published twice a week, Tuesday and Friday.The best description of us is: Of English language daily papers in the world today, we are the oldestNot all our retrospective columns are labelled ‘On This Day  Years Ago’, because some reproductions fall on a day when the News Letter was not published in the s. Those days, we entitle it ‘On This Week  Years Ago’.The s papers are a tantalising glimpse into le  years after the Plantation. Sadly it is just a glimpse. There is a small batch of surviving News Letters from October  until summer .Almost all other editions of the paper, from September  to the early s, are lost, perhaps , of the first , News Letters.It is painful to think of the snippets of news that are lost. For example, the surviving News Letters from the s have reports on Dean Maturin, Dean of Christchurch Cathedral in Dublin, and one on the satirical writer Jonathan Swt, Dean of St Patrick’s nearby.There are likely to be other reports on Swt, who did not die until , but we will not know because papers from that year are lost.There are also News Letter reports on performances of operas by the composer Handel in London in , and so there was almost certainly an account of the  premiere of his Messiah in Dublin, but those papers are also lost.There are only four surviving News Letters from , two from October and two from December.There are another two from both January  and February , and then an intact batch from March  to the autumn.Next week we serialise the December   paper, which is January   in the modern calendar. On the relevant weeks in January and February we will serialise those four editions too.From March, when the old batch of surviving  papers begins, we will serialise those each day,  years after publication.The dating of the papers is baffling to the modern reader. Papers from January, February and early March  are dated . This is because in the old Julian calendar, which was replaced in  with the current Gregorian calendar, the new year began on March .The calendar went from December   to January  , and so on until March  , the day after which was dated March  .This has confounded people ever since. An early News Letter dated March  is wrongly thought earlier than the October  first surviving paper, but it isn’t: it is March  in today’s calendar.The News Letter itself made this error on its centenary in , when it got confused by the quirks of the Julian calendar.This is unsurprising: in  only people aged + would have had any memory of the Julian calendar.So enjoy our coming On This Day or On This Week serialisations.Meanwhile, I reiterate my appeal, made previously, for people to search their attics for some of the lost News Letters from the s, s and s.I am convinced that some of them still exist.

Mr Rees-Mogg has defended his decision, saying there is “little to read in to” him declining the offer to speak at an NI Conservatives fundraiser.Mr Rees-Mogg told the i newspaper: “I am looking forward to being the guest of the DUP in January which I will combine with a visit to the Titanic museum with one of my children.“The chancellor of the exchequer and Boris Johnston addressed the recent DUP conference so it is clear that Tories are allowed to address such events.“As I speak to nearly  Conservative s a year there is little to read in to my refusal to accept a particular invitation.”Alan Dunlop, chairman of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, suggested Mr Rees-Mogg has made an “odd alliance”.He said: “Backbench MPs are free to speak to anyone they wish to. There is a clear convention within the Conservative Party, however, not to speak in support of rival political parties.“Jacob Rees-Mogg is a highly respected member of the party with impeccable knowledge of UK constitutional politics and conventions and therefore will be fully aware of this.“Sadly on occasions, often in an honest defence of their principle political views, politicians find themselves making odd alliances and standing elements of their own political logic on their heads. They make themselves look foolish when they do so.”Mr Dunlop added: “We will extend understanding to our colleague Jacob on this occasion and hope that when he visits he will accept our invitation for a cup of tea so that we can discuss with him the important political issues facing Northern Ireland in  in detail.”Jacob Rees-Mogg turns down Tories to fundraise for DUP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
