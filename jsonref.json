We piled onto the coach to take us to London at 5.30am.‘Catherine — who even then was fantastic at building a team and keeping up morale — led everyone in endless rounds of Ten Green Bottles.

The pair were known as Middleton C and Middleton P. James (right) was to start in 1991‘Many parents came. Carole was busy, but I remember her ringing regularly to check progress. When we got home all the parents were there to meet us with mounds of fish and chips and dozens of bottles of champagne.’Both Denise and Kevin are quick to point out that while Carole was an involved parent, she was far from pushy. ‘There were some parents whose voices you dreaded hearing on the phone,’ says Kevin. ‘And Carole was definitely not one of them. When she rang — which she rarely did — she would have a point.‘For example, Catherine had obviously told her she thought it was unfair the boys had a big common room with a pool table and the girls didn’t.‘Carole rang and asked why. We agreed it was unfair and, entirely as a result of her intervention, rules were changed. From then on it was a joint common room.’But while it was Carole who made the tricky phone calls, it was left to her husband Mike to be the school entertainer.‘Like in most marriages, the woman is in charge,’ says Denise. ‘Mike had the most gorgeous sense of humour. You could have a joke with him.‘At the end of every term, we always had a parents’ match — the girls’ netball team would play the parents and Mike would turn up and be the joker.

The Labour party doesn’t seem just miserable because it lost it imparts despair and anxiety.These are not unfamiliar feelings to many. The last week of January is said to be depressing but it was also when Brexit happened and change was in the air. Mood matters. Those who fail to read the mood of the populace are destined never to govern it, but we have very few ways of talking about feelings in political terms.Do you remember the brief time when we did? Instead of talking about infrastructure and immigration, we talked about something much more intangible. Happiness: Lessons from a New Science, the economist Richard Layard’s book, published in 2005, had a massive impact on public discourse. It started asking government to be concerned with something even more vague than happiness: “wellbeing”.Wellbeing, like happiness, is self–reported. You can ask me how I am. You don’t really want to know, but we can all tick the boxes. The statistics on mental health – about one in four Britons will experience a mental health problem each year – are really telling us that many of us are very far from any sense of wellbeing.Joining the dots between policy and inidual happiness became mainstream. David Cameron tried to talk about “a national happiness index” as the post-crash economy was in turmoil. He had addressed this at a Google Zeitgeist Europe conference, saying there was more to life than money. GDP was not the answer, apparently, but GWB: general wellbeing. This, he said, was a key challenge for politicians.Those were the days, my friend … and then he unleashed George Osborne and let him hack away at the welfare state and basic benefits, to ensure that wellbeing and even getting by were but distant dreams.We know social inequality causes depression and stress. We also know that this country has been a very anxious place for the past few years and while many are upset by the Tory landslide and Brexit, others feel a sense of resolution. Businesses are saying they can at least plan ahead, but many ordinary folks are feeling a fall in life satisfaction.The infrastructure that provides the conditions for happiness have been decimated: community centres and youth clubs and schools (as something other than exam factories). Meanwhile, town centres have been suffering. Every time we hear of another big store closing down we know there will be another boarded-up high street. Growth isn’t infinite, and shopping as a leisure activity is mostly a reminder of what you don’t have rather than an activity that brings any sort of meaning and connection.The organisations that do provide social value are small, local and arise organically, such as volunteer-run cafes and community gardens. They are the very opposite of the centralised state enterprises that the Corbyn cohort dream of. It may not have intended to, but Labour’s pessimism has allowed Boris Johnson to surf this wave of optimism – as fraudulent as it may be – because it signals a break not so much with the EU but with miserablism.This really matters in ways that politicians appear still not to get. If you talk only of bad things, it is hard to appear as someone who loves their country. If you largely speak of your constituents as victims then you disempower them. Corbyn and his acolytes really have owned their Eeyoreness. They’ve made it easy for someone with a skewed but, yes, happier vision of the future to walk all over them.Positive psychology, a theory that says external circumstances make almost no difference to our own happiness, is flawed. No, I really don’t want to hear anyone talk about their gratitude journal. Count your blessings in private. Many things are beyond our control, but actually the things most people give thanks for – friends and family and relationships and jobs and housing and money – do matter. Talking nonstop about austerity and the climate emergency and coming recession has not made people more energised or leftwing.Instead they have become passive and anxious. Jeremy Corbyn may as well stop doing prime minister’s questions and just tunelessly sing Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now. Wellbeing, contentment – no one currently associates them with Labour. They seem like ideas from another age. They are lost. Just listen to the words of Winnie the Pooh: “Don’t underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can’t hear, and not bothering.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d9318fa00a3483ed37813a2da2344e36ea961a8/0_100_3396_2036/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=868258fe9757d000a6b6494f198f370a","title":"iowa caucuses democrats black voters","story":"If Democrats want to dismantle white supremacy, they can start right now by dismantling a caucus system that ignores black votersThe results from Iowa are in: there are no results.On Thursday, three days after the caucuses began on Monday, the Associated Press announced that due to irregularities and how close the race is, it would be unable to declare a winner.Confusion and a lack of information are the story coming out of Iowa right now. But there’s another story worth telling: that, no matter who wins, the results won’t be representative of the Democratic race for president writ large. And that’s because the Democratic nomination process, by starting in Iowa and New Hampshire, systematically drowns out the voices and power of black voters.There’s no doubt Iowa is important under the current Democratic primary system. It is seen as a crucial test of electability, and in seven of the last nine contested Democratic primaries, the winner of the Iowa caucuses went on to win the Democratic nomination for president. But both the state, being predominantly white, and the type of election it holds, a caucus, actively diminish the role of black voters in the process. By continuing to allow the Iowa caucuses to hold such an influential role in the Democratic nomination process, the Democratic party is failing its black voters, plain and simple.But demographics aren’t the only reason the Iowa caucuses are a disaster for black voters. It’s also the caucus itself. By its very nature, caucuses are undemocratic. They require would-be caucus-goers to spend long hours that many Iowans simply don’t have (or simply don’t have off work). Who has the time to participate in that process? People who can afford an extra night of childcare. People who can afford to take off work, or who work during “traditional” business hours and don’t have to even arrange to take the time off. People who aren’t managing chronic illnesses or physical disabilities that precincts haven’t accounted for. People who don’t have a parent to take care of. People who, in one way or another, are privileged.It’s hard to think of a state and a form of voting that would do more to disenfranchise the voices of black voters in the Democratic nomination process than the Iowa caucuses. If we ordered the Democratic primaries in terms of how representative and fair they are, Iowa would be close to last. And yet, beyond logic, the Iowa caucuses somehow have more influence than any other state.In Iowa, we’re watching the current Democratic primary system silence black voters in real time. It’s time to put an end to it.If the Democratic party is going to dismantle white supremacy, it can start right now by dismantling another system: its very own primary and caucus system that effectively diminishes black voters’ voices. Nothing short of creating a new system that gives black voters just as much of a say as anyone else is acceptable.We cannot accept complacency. Not in the white voters who just don’t care enough to show up at the polls, nor in a Democratic party that won’t create a fair and democratic nomination system.Right now, there’s a spotlight shining on Iowa. I hope we use it to illuminate the real injustice of the caucuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac20cf0931ab16a42e910241f480c9cb05e69044/340_465_2906_1743/master/2906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bb6d6645105f8e932e0cf304bfb9db4","title":"is the democratic primary really just down to sanders and buttigieg now","story":"Friday’s Democratic debate was pitched as a battle between the centrist and the left-wing candidate. But that’s not quite how it played outHeading into Friday night’s Democratic debate, the media had effectively declared that the Democratic primary was down to only two viable candidates: Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont. Monday’s Iowa caucuses had ended with the two candidates effectively tied after disastrous and seemingly systemic incompetence drew out the reporting process for days. The debate in New Hampshire was pitched as a contest between them, a bid to see which would prevail – the moderate, big money-backed Buttigieg, or the grassroots financing juggernaught of the progressive Sanders. Prognoses pitched the debate as a battle between the party’s ideological factions, and speculated at how the two men would attack each other, and which would prevail.But the five other candidates onstage had other plans. Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, attacked Buttigieg fiercely and repeatedly. The moderate Senator is competing with the mayor for the Democratic party’s right flank, and it made strategic sense for her to go after the man stealing away what she sees as her most likely voters. But there was also what seemed like a degree of sincere personal contempt in Klobuchar’s remarks toward Buttigieg. She has remarked before that his youth and inexperience would not be overlooked so easily in a woman candidate, and her comments on his inconsistent positions and lack of national experience carried with them a sting of anger at his arrogance and easy rise to the top of the polls. The exchanges highlighted Klobuchar’s refreshing authenticity, coming as they did on a stage full of people who are very practiced in saying things they do not mean. This combined with a ready sense of humor made Klobuchar a more charismatic figure on stage than many of her competitors, even as her policy positions continue to tend toward the unimaginative, uninspired, and unambitious, and threaten to reproduce ongoing cruelties.Klobuchar was not alone in attacking Buttigieg, as his competitors for the moderate wing of the party seemed to have determined that he poses the greatest risk to their own success. The billionaire Tom Steyer attacked his inexperience and said that he was afraid that the mayor couldn’t beat Trump. And former Vice President Joe Biden, though often incomprehensible, seemed to make a similar case implying that the mayor would not be able to effectively reach across the aisle. Even Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out that only her campaign and Klobuchar’s were being supported neither through their personal wealth nor through opaque 501(c) 4 organizations, a comment that named no names but implicitly cast aspersions on Buttegeig’s robust fundraising operation, which relies heavily on wealthy iniduals and organizations that are not required to disclose their donors.If attacking Buttigieg was popular, the mayor himself did little to convince viewers that he did not deserve it. He responded to questions and volleyed attacks with his accustomed air of rehearsed imprecision, never deviating from his robotic affect and never giving a straight answer. The only time he ever seemed to answer a direct “yes” or “no” question was once, early in the evening, when he responded in the affirmative to confirm that he was indeed trying to attack Sanders.Buttigieg dodged questions on his healthcare plan and he dodged a question on a troubling history of police racism during his tenure as the Mayor of South Bend. He was heavy on niceties, light on specifics. He made lots of calls for unity, specifically in his attacks on the Senators to his left, but he did not have much to say about what Americans should unify around, or how to persuade them do so. His answers sounded more like marketing copy for a nefarious tech start up than like statements of political principle. He looked, more than anything, like a man who has not relaxed since he was a child.Through his cloud of consultant-speak and imprecision, it became clear that Buttigieg was trying to attack Sanders, and specifically, trying to emphasize that the Vermont Senator was isive. He wasn’t alone in this project. Biden in particular attacked Sanders, pointing out, correctly, that Sanders has not released a financing plan for his signature Medicare for All plan, and speculated, incorrectly, that the plan would double the federal budget and wildly increase, if not outright double, taxes for working people.For his part, Sanders parlayed most of these attacks with uncharacteristic patience, and he was at his best when he was making the plain moral case for his progressive positions, as when he called for erting funds that have been spent on disastrous foreign wars to help fight climate change instead. Still, at times Sanders seemed a bit daunted by the attacks. At one point, he had to walk back and disavow comments made by his own campaign co-chair, Nina Turner. He did not give a concrete answer to a question about his past pro-gun stances. At another point, he answered a question on foreign policy, an area where his competence has improved tremendously since 2016, in a rambling and distracted manner, failing to make the plain humanitarian case for his own noninterventionist position. It’s clear that Sanders is not used to receiving these kinds of attacks from his competitors: this is the first time that they are attacking him in a sustained manner, and that is probably because this is the first time that they have taken his candidacy seriously. Withstanding these aggressions is a skill he will have to hone if he is to face Trump in a general election as the party’s nominee.Unexpectedly little was heard from Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusettes, who has been largely absent from media narratives about the race in the days since the Iowa caucuses. Despite conventional wisdom that the primary grants “three tickets out of Iowa,” her better-than-expected third place finish has been overlooked in favor of a myopic focus by the pundit class on the emerging rivalry between Buttigieg and Sanders. On the debate stage, Warren tried to use this to her advantage: while her rivals attacked one another and everyone else, she avoided making direct criticisms of other candidates and instead used every answer to make a broad moral case for her own position, tying everything back to her recurring anti-corruption message. At times, this involved some impressive verbal contortions: a question about gun control became an answer about gun control, gun suicides, domestic violence, and the political bribery power of the NRA. She stayed out of the sectarian fights that erupted around her, and depicted herself as a dedicated anticorruption advocate who could rise above the fray. The strategy seemed to be to show herself being the thing that the other candidates kept loudly declaring themselves to be: the unity candidate.Andrew Yang was also present.But a shadow hung over the debate: Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire who entered the presidential race in November. Bloomberg is effectively sitting out the first several contests of the primary cycle, and as a self-funded candidate, he does not qualify for the televised debates. But the super-billionaire is buying huge amounts of airtime in Super Tuesday states to run commercials for his bid his stiffly smiling face appears whenever you flip on a television. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both went out of their way to say that it was not acceptable for someone so wealthy to try to effectively purchase themselves political office. “A billionaire shouldn’t be able to buy their way into this race,” Warren said. He shouldn’t be able to. But its very possible that he can.

Treat them like a real-life virus• Adam Kucharski is an epidemiologist and authorWhen reports of a new coronavirus emerged last month, I speculated with fellow epidemiologists about what the media might end up naming the infection. None of us would have guessed that within a week or so a theory would be circulating that coronavirus was a new kind of “snake flu”– mostly because it’s unlikely the virus originated in snakes, and it’s not flu.So where did the snakes come from? The culprit was a widely shared scientific paper, which speculated that the new virus had genetic characteristics and implicated snakes as the source. Leading geneticists were quick to point out that the results weren’t convincing, and that bats were still the likely suspects. However, that didn’t stop snake flu from going viral. Other misinformation about coronavirus has rippled across the internet in recent weeks. From claims the virus is part-HIV to conspiracy theories about bioweapons and reports suggesting the virus was linked to people eating bat soup, stories sparking fear seem to have overtaken the outbreak in real life. Is misinformation really more contagious than the virus itself?It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.We typically think of viral content as a chain reaction: you share something with friends, they share it with their friends, and so on. In disease outbreak analysis, we can measure the transmission of an infection by looking at how many additional cases each infected person creates on average during each of these steps. We call this the “reproduction number”, and for coronavirus, we estimate it’s about 2 for a typical infected case in China. What about the reproduction number for online content? A couple of years ago, Facebook researchers looked at the most shared content on the platform from 2014 to 2016, including viral trends such as the ice-bucket challenge and putting an equals sign over your profile picture to support marriage equality.Remarkably, there wasn’t much difference in the transmission. Researchers found the reproduction number was about 2 for all of them. Remember, these were the most shared ideas on Facebook the vast majority of online content is lucky to get even a single repost.To fully explain how viral content – and viruses – spread, we need to move away from the idea that outbreaks involve simple clockwork infections, passing along a chain from person to person to person until large numbers have been exposed. During the 2015 outbreak of the Mers coronavirus in South Korea, 82 out of 186 infections came from a single “superspreading event” in a hospital where an infected person was being treated. It’s not yet clear how common such superspreading is in the current outbreak, but we do know that these kinds of events are how information goes viral online most outbreaks on Twitter are dominated by a handful of iniduals or media outlets, which are responsible for a large proportion of transmission. If you heard about snake flu, you might have told a couple of friends meanwhile, newspaper headlines were telling millions.When tackling disease outbreaks, health agencies often work to identify potential superspreading events, isolating infected iniduals to prevent further transmission. However, this isn’t the only way to stop an outbreak. As well as tracking down people who are infectious, it’s possible to target broader social interactions that might amplify transmission. For example, many cities in China have recently closed schools, which can be hotspots for respiratory infections.Tech companies are now adopting similar approaches to tackle health misinformation. Last year, Pinterest announced it had rewired its search results to make it harder to find vaccine misinformation. It had struggled to remove the content completely – the equivalent of finding all the cases during a disease outbreak – so instead focused on reducing how many people might be exposed to harmful content. During the current outbreak, Google is attempting to reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation by displaying links to reputable health sources when users search for information about the virus.These combined approaches, which target different aspects of transmission, have long been used in disease control. By introducing analogous strategies online, we should have a better chance of effectively curbing harmful viral content.Ensuring the public has the best possible health information is crucial during an outbreak. At best, misinformation can distract from important messages. At worst, it can lead to behaviour that amplifies disease transmission. The novelty of coronavirus makes the challenge even greater, because viral speculation can easily overwhelm the limited information we do have. The scientific community is already making huge progress in understanding the infection, but we’ve had to start at the bottom, without stacks of earlier research to stand on. When it comes to stopping the outbreak, we’ll need ladders, not snakes.• Adam Kucharski an epidemiologist and the author of The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop, published on 13 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

In Joensuu, the compact city in eastern Finland, where I am now, it’s arguably a more serious business.When I got off the train from Helsinki the temperature was -16C (3F), and hasn’t yet risen higher than -6C. Every roadway, pavement and cycle route is covered in a layer of compacted snow.I’m in Joensuu because I was invited to come and see the Winter Cycling Congress, an annual gathering of researchers, academics and city officials, which is hosted by a different chilly municipality every year.After a couple of days of speaking to people here, two main lessons have emerged. Firstly, while winter cycling does bring its challenges, these are not always the ones you might expect. Secondly, and this is perhaps more predictable, if you want more people on bikes in winter, it’s less about iniduals than infrastructure.In terms of the practicalities of riding on snow, Joensuu-like conditions of compacted snow are pretty easy. Almost everyone I’ve seen pedalling around this week has been using everyday bikes with ordinary tyres.Ari Varonen, the city’s chief roads engineer, told me that Joensuu’s bike routes are ploughed with the same tractors used for roads. They have a blade to push away fresh snow and add grooves to the surface to make it less slippery. The lanes are then gritted, rather than using bike-corroding salt.If the weather stays below freezing, all is fine. But as Matti Koistinen, head of the Finnish Cyclists’ Federation, explained to me, more varied temperatures are what cause the biggest problems.“If it’s really packed snow, like it is now, it’s comfortable to ride on. But when the temperature goes above 0C it becomes hell. It becomes very slushy, and then when it freezes again it’s pure ice, and really bouncy.”At this point, the consensus seems, it is best to only venture out on a bike with tyres fitted with metal studs, given you can never be sure if a newly refrozen track has been freshly gritted.Joensuu has several advantages as a cycling city. It is relatively small, almost entirely flat, and its wide streets were mainly built in recent decades – as recently as the 1950s it only had a population of about 7,000.But it also has a comprehensive system of separated cycle routes, some just for bikes, others as part of a wide footway. This is particularly crucial, Varonen told me: “A bike lane just painted on the road wouldn’t work here in winter time. If you have packed snow, you can’t even see the marks. So no one would use it.”Again, we come back to a perennial theme of the bike blog: if you want a lot of people to cycle, you need consistent political will to spend money on proper cycling facilities over the long term.That politicians in Joensuu are committed to cycling, and active transport more generally, is clear from the Winter Cycling Congress. The city’s mayor, Kari Karjalainen, not only greeted delegates at an opening reception but took his turn pedalling the static bike used to power the event’s PA system.While cycling groups in Britain are generally marginalised by the government, Koistinen sits as a representative of the cyclists’ federation on the official committee tasked with coming up with ways to reduce emissions.A pitfall of endlessly detailing forward-thinking policies in places such as Joensuu is that people in other countries can be tempted to shrug their shoulders and just assume, well, the Finns do things differently.But you could take another lesson. The opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress took place at the city’s main school where, the teachers say, about half of pupils still ride to school in winter. On the morning in question, it was -13C and snowing. But the school’s bike racks were full.That’s perhaps something to think about next time you wonder whether you can face a bike ride in winter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0762fd43b844d92de49c7c116864573f02fc0989/47_0_2832_1700/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f99a0e4cc1b1d1c6e9b89235a9202649","title":"modern ark designs for the new climate reality in pictures","story":"Floating villages and an ‘amphibious house’ are among some of the solutions as architecture adapts to the growing problem of urban flooding• Sea Change: Flood Resilient Architecture for the 21st Century is at the Roca London Gallery, until 16 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6515f9d6f836519c7620701a249800bfd87a88b/0_0_3344_2229/master/3344.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=54f168dd3493139fb5766e94f5da0cee 960w","title":"harvey weinstein trial unreliable memories elizabeth loftus","story":"Elizabeth Loftus says ‘post-event information’ can color recollections and ‘emotion is not a guarantee’ memory is authenticLawyers for Harvey Weinstein turned on Friday to an expert known for studying false, repressed and unreliable memories who has worked on behalf of clients including the serial killer Ted Bundy.Weinstein’s fate in his rape trial in New York City largely hinges on what his accusers remember about alleged sexual assaults years ago. Testimony from Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive psychologist, often helps undermine people who say they are victims.“It doesn’t take a PhD to know that memory fades over time,” Loftus told jurors in the New York supreme court.As memories fade, she said, people become more vulnerable to “post-event information” including media reports that can distort what they remember. They also can distort their own memories with inferences and guesses about past events.False memories “can be experienced with a great deal of detail, a great deal of emotion, even though they’re false”, she said. “The emotion is not a guarantee you’re dealing with an authentic memory.”Loftus, 75, took the witness stand a day after prosecutors rested their case. It featured more than two weeks of testimony, including the accounts of six women who say the once powerful Hollywood producer subjected them to vile sexual behavior.Weinstein’s lawyers are aiming to cement doubts about the women’s allegations after using cross-examination to highlight inconsistencies in some accounts. In some cases, the encounters the women recalled allegedly happened a decade or more ago.Weinstein’s lawyers have not said if he will testify. If he does, he could give prosecutors an opening to bring in more witnesses to rebut anything he says.“That is a question that does not have an answer at this point,” attorney Arthur Aidala said. “We want to see how our defense case goes.”Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in March 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on a different woman in 2006. Weinstein, 67, has maintained any sexual encounters were consensual.Loftus was on the stand for about an hour, her testimony curtailed by a ruling barring her from testifying about memories specific to sexual interactions. She testified that she was not asked to evaluate any of the accusers or their testimony.Loftus is the co-author of the 1994 book The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegation of Sexual Abuse. In another book, Witness for the Defense, Loftus wrote that in her work for Bundy she seized on “leading and suggestive questions” by investigators and “hesitations and uncertainties on the part of the victim” as signs of muddled memories.On the stand on Friday, she sounded a similar note, telling jurors interactions with law enforcement “can lead people to want to produce details”.“Some can be accurate, and some can be false and inaccurate,” she said.When prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon asked if she was originally asked to be a defense consultant rather than a witness, Loftus said: “I don’t remember what I was asked exactly.”“Is that due to post-event information?” Illuzzi-Orbon quipped.Weinstein’s lawyers skipped plans to call the Hollywood writer and director Warren Leight, to testify about Annabella Sciorra’s drug use during a shoot in the early 1990s.Sciorra, now 59, testified that she was hooked on Valium when The Night We Never Met started shooting in late 1992, but denied defense suggestions she was still using it when she alleges Weinstein raped her in 1993 or 1994."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/105ee85b07cf98516b7cce86f68cb5c2735f13b6/116_246_3398_2038/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761c0fadf232a546b8f07eed51b2d299","title":"stars urged to ditch the sequins at the oscars to save the oceans","story":"Although shiny on the red carpet they ‘hide serious socio-environmental impacts’Fashion insiders are warning the great and the good of Hollywood not to wear sequins on the Academy Awards red carpet because of their terrible environmental impact.Last Sunday at the Baftas, despite guests being urged to opt for more planet-friendly fashion choices, Scarlett Johansson wore a sequinned pink Versace dress, Rebel Wilson was wrapped in a red sequin custom-made Prabal Gurung gown and Naomie Harris shone in silver sequinned Michael Kors. At the Grammys and Golden Globes last month, the red carpets were similarly awash with sequins.Awards season is an opportunity for stars to send a message. Sustainable fashion consultant Alice Wilby would like to see a blanket ban on sequins and believes that if celebrities “really care about sustainability, they would stop wearing sequins on the red carpet”.They “are made from toxic, petroleum-based plastics which pollute our living planet and persist for hundreds of years”, according to Leigh McAlea of Traid. “Like the fashion industry itself, sequins may be shiny on the outside but they hide serious socio-environmental impacts,” she said.Sequins also raise issues of working conditions and supply chain transparency. “Much finishing work is done by hand,” according to McAlea, “and factories often subcontract to homeworkers, typically women and child labourers, who are easily exploited.”There are more sustainable versions available. According to Wilby, “recycled PET sequins and biodegradable options are being developed”. But, she said: “Unless we instantly replace all plastic sequin production with biodegradable options, the eco-version will still be inspiring people to buy the cheaper plastic version.”While sequins on the high street might be more damaging in terms of scale, frequency of washing and life, sequins on the red carpet send a strong message. “The ‘Red Carpet’ is a powerful platform. Our clothes speak volumes about who we are and what we stand for,” advised the Baftas’ sustainable dressing guide last weekend.Livia Firth, founder of Eco Age, a sustainable fashion consultancy that is challenging celebrities to dress more sustainably via its Green Carpet Challenge, said: “Fashion has a huge power to change the world and it’s time for everyone to show how.”As for any difference between the red carpet incarnations and those that are mass-produced, Wilby said: “Wearing a couture gown embellished with sequins that have been sewn by a seamstress who is well paid and well treated is no excuse,” she said, citing the impact on the trend-cycle. “It creates the desire for a raft of cheap, imitation dresses that will be worn a few times and then tossed. It’s time to stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddedc649e02c142de5e3aca8365ba09ed3f9aee4/0_10_1998_1199/master/1998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d917f0feef2ab0c16f7c3f903c27c30e","title":"high thread count the trending topics that deserve the hollywood treatment","story":"After Zola – a film based on a Twitter thread – became a breakout hit at Sundance, we look at what else might be heading to cinemas soon The breakout hit at this year’s Sundance festival was Zola (pictured, above), a comic thriller about a stripper who travels to Florida for a weekend of sex and violence. Zola earned rave reviews from attendees, but the most interesting thing about it is that it was based on a Twitter thread. In 2015, Aziah “Zola” Wells wrote 148 tweets about the weekend she had just experienced. It was incredible recounting each new jaw-dropping twist with such breathless excitement that Hollywood soon came knocking.And who could blame them? After years spent adapting the same novels, video games and comic books to diminishing returns, why wouldn’t the industry try something new by acquiring the rights to a wildly successful Twitter thread? If Zola is a success – which looks likely to be the case – then it will open the floodgates for a new breed of films derived from other viral intellectual property. Luckily, there are plenty of options …Remember the #PlaneBae saga, where a bored woman on a flight eavesdropped on a burgeoning flirtation between two attractive strangers sitting in the seats in front of her? Remember how the woman being tweeted about was so appalled that she wrote a damning statement that made us all question our addiction to oversharing online? This deserves to be a Jordan Peele horror film. Melissa McCarthy to play the eavesdropper. Zak Efron and Vanessa Hudgens to play the couple.In this 2017 Twitter thread, a woman recounts the time she accidentally went on an OkCupid date with a 97-year-old man. The date starts off weirdly, then gets sweet. And then, right at the end, finishes with full-blown horror. There might not be a market yet for films based on offers of nonagenarian cunnilingus, but that’s only because nobody has had the guts to debut one yet. Naomi Scott to play the girl, Robert Redford to play the old man. Sam Taylor-Johnson to direct.In arguably the greatest Vine of all time, an unseen hand squeezes a rubber duck in a supermarket. It quacks. Then he squeezes an entire binful of rubber ducks, and they roar like a bloodthirsty invading army. There is so much story potential here that it’s ridiculous. Where did the ducks come from? What made them so angry? Why were they lying in wait in a supermarket? Was it an ambush? This will be a big-budget DreamWorks animation. Mel Gibson to voice all the ducks.In 2015, a video of the world’s angriest person went viral. The US woman was arguing with restaurant workers who had apparently put green peppers on her kebab because “my children don’t eat green things”. She launched into a racist tirade about the workers, before screaming: “This is America! You get it right the first time!” over and over again. And then, as she left, she banged her head on the door. I propose a Mr Bean-style movie about this woman, where she endures a series of increasingly elaborate pratfalls every time she is rude to people who don’t deserve it. Honestly, I don’t care who plays this. Steve-O in a wig could do it.

Sacked from bigger newspapers for being unreliable, drinking on the job and much worse, Tatum persuades the paper’s worthy editor, who works under an embroidered sampler bearing the words “Tell the Truth”, to give him a job despite his better judgment. “I can handle big news and little news. And if there’s no news, I’ll go out and bite a dog,” Tatum promises.This is the set-up for the best film made yet about the ethics of the press. And, although the death of Douglas last Wednesday elicited deserved praise for his other famous roles, in Spartacus, Paths of Glory and Lust for Life, it is this film that really gave the actor’s merciless screen presence full rein. Douglas himself recognised the strength he brought to the screen, whether cast as a hero or an antihero: “It doesn’t matter if you’re a nice guy or you’re a bastard. What matters is, you won’t bend!” he told Esquire magazine in 1969.Ace in the Hole, directed by the masterful Billy Wilder, creator of Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity, swiftly becomes a blistering portrayal of the dynamics of what we now call “a media circus”. Inspired by the real-life press feeding frenzy that sprang up in 1925 when a man called Floyd Collins was trapped in a Kentucky cave, the plot has Tatum taking control of the scene of a mining disaster and working it to his own ends. Quickly establishing himself inside the filling station run by a trapped man’s wife, the newshound twists the facts to suit his tale and shows no visible pangs of guilt. “I’ve met a lotta hard-boiled eggs in my life, but you, you’re 20 minutes,” the wife tells Tatum in grudging awe.As the late critic Roger Ebert noted when Wilder’s film was released on video in 2007, “there is not a wasted shot”. But really it is the performance that Douglas gives that powers the action. His Tatum is a horribly convincing portrayal of an unsympathetic, tortured soul. The star “is at his most uningratiatingly forceful in virtually every scene”, judged Philip French in an appreciation of the film he wrote for the Observer in 2014. He makes you believe you are watching a human being capable of anything.The title of Wilder’s film is taken from stud poker and refers to Tatum’s search for the competitive edge in the ruthless game of selling news to the public. But the screenplay, co-written by the director with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, proved too gritty for general consumption, and the film failed on its first release during the height of McCarthyism in America. The movie studio tried again later, renaming it The Big Carnival, but still it upset audience assumptions about what a good film should offer.The press were not happy either. After all, what Douglas’s reporter does is worse than even the lurid nightmares of a misused litigant in the British phone-hacking scandal. When Tatum discovers that the trapped man could be freed from the mineshaft in just two days, he finds an elaborate way to lengthen the process and so provide a better national spectacle.His behaviour is beyond the pale for even a hardened Fleet Street hack, although his efforts to persuade the man’s disaffected wife to pretend to be loyal are closer to the mark. In disreputable newsrooms, stories are still adjusted to fit the template of readers’ expectations.Wilder knew the newspaper business. He had worked on a series of popular titles in Vienna and Berlin in the 1920s. The only concession he made to the honour of his old trade is that Ace in the Hole is almost as hard on the public appetite for sensation and drama as it is on the workings of the press. The film is shot in black and white but its real triumph is its shades of grey. There is humanity and morality in the story, but not quite enough.To watch Douglas here is to be reminded that just because a film was made 70 years ago it doesn’t mean it was made in simpler times. And, on Oscar weekend, it is worth remembering that those films that endure are not always the ones to win early plaudits. The classics that go on to earn a place in people’s hearts, or ultimately to be acclaimed by critics, often fall by the wayside in the initial awards goldrush.His Girl FridayThe 1940 reworking of Ben Hecht’s play The Front Page stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as sparring reporters.All the President’s MenAlan J Pakula’s 1976 lodestar for all political thrillers, in which the Washington Post’s Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward unravel the truth about Watergate.The PaperGlenn Close’s executive and Michael Keaton’s news editor battle to keep the fictional New York Sun afloat in Ron Howard’s 1994 comic requiem for the press.Spotlight2016 Oscar-winning tribute to the real-life work of the Boston Globe newsroom exposes sex abuse in the Catholic church.The PostMeryl Streep and Tom Hanks play owner and editor of the Washington Post, who clash and then concur in this tense 2017 handling of another Washington scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e83866a708380e73c587e52213d41f62b53fe32/0_2794_5792_3474/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eac028ead3e93d673bd855557330bd2","title":"liam charles recipe valentines day baked alaska","story":"A showstopping dessert to present with a flourish on Valentine’s nightIf you need something that will impress this Valentine’s Day, then I’m your guy.

Martin Jol, his manager at Tottenham, labelled him “a wizard”. A few years later at QPR, Harry Redknapp described him “three stone overweight.” Both are probably close to being true. But nobody ever dared to call the Moroccan a defensive midfielder, even Taarabt himself: when asked to respond to Redknapp’s criticism, the then 24-year-old simply replied “maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player.”Except, this season for Benfica, that is exactly the type of player Taarabt has become and at the age of 30, he is playing the best football of his life – an all-action combative menace at the base of midfield: snapping into challenges, shouting and ordering his team-mates this way and that, and yes, occasionally still nutmegging people.Some old tricks remain, but Taarabt’s transformation is a remarkable one. It has not happened overnight: signed by Benfica in 2015, it took him nearly four years to make a first-team appearance for the Portuguese giants. During the first year of his five-year contract, grainy videos circulated of him turning out for the reserves, punting corner kicks straight into the side netting. An 18-month loan to Genoa followed, during which Taarabt admitted he had lost 11kg of weight. Another season in Benfica’s reserves came and went before he finally managed to break into the first team in 2019.There is not one single reason why Taarabt has fallen back in love with football, and why football has fallen back in love with him, but his loan spell at Genoa in 2017-18, and his relationship with Ivan Juric, his manager there, is one of the most important. “When I first arrived at Genoa, I was out of shape and there were problems” said Taarabt. “I am coming back now, not quite what I was before, but I’m getting there. With Ivan, you always have to go full pelt. He’s fair, though. If you prove that you understood what went wrong, he’ll press the reset button and start again. I don’t know if we can call each other friends, but he certainly changed my life – and my body.”The Moroccan’s relationships with his various managers have defined the peaks and troughs of his career. Neil Warnock was the first to fully nurture his extraordinary talent. Taarabt went from Spurs cast-off to QPR captain in a few months at just 21 years old, was made to feel what he is – a star – and spent most of 2010-11 waltzing around the Championship like he owned the place, which he did.Those at Loftus Road would simply sing “Taarabt’s too good for you”, which he was. At the end of one performance – a 4-0 win over promotion rivals Swansea – Warnock can be seen with his hands on his head in disbelief at Taarabt’s performance, not unlike the manager’s comical centre-circle stare-off with referee Craig Pawson last year. A solo strike against Preston was probably the goal of the season, while one outside-of-the-boot pass to set up the winner against Coventry, was surely the best pass Loftus Road had seen since Stan Bowles’s sublime pass against Leicester in 1977. QPR were promoted as champions in May 2011, with Taarabt finishing with 19 goals and 16 assists from 44 league appearances.The clips for Benfica these days are perhaps not as extraterrestrial, but arguably more impressive given that Taarabt is now playing in Champions League, not the Championship. Domestically, Benfica are currently top of the table, having won 18 of their 19 games, and face their only conquerors this season, Porto, on Saturday at the Estádio do Dragão. It is a monumental match between the two biggest rivals in Portugal, and even at this stage, probably represents Porto’s last chance to deny Benfica a sixth title in seven seasons.Taarabt’s contribution will likely be crucial to Benfica’s chances. He scored and was man-of-the-match in their last league game against Belenenses, a narrow 3-2 win, and has formed an excellent understanding alongside Julian Weigl, the £18m January recruit from Borussia Dortmund.Just as Warnock nurtured at QPR, and Clarence Seedorf supported Taarabt during his successful loan spell at Milan in 2014, the encouragement from Bruno Lage at Benfica has been pivotal to Taarabt re-establishing himself. “We tried to place him as second striker, but we felt that we could take more advantage of him in the double pivot,” the head coach said recently. “He gives us defensive balance and also quality in attack.”Few have known the ups and downs that Taarabt has experienced: lurching from cult hero to Karl Henry’s back-up at QPR, keeping Robinho out of the side at Milan before weight gain, obscurity and now redemption at Benfica. There will always be the nagging feeling that Taarabt could have achieved more, but with the arrival of Saturday night’s O Clássico, we should just enjoy him for what he is: a street footballer trying to fit in on the big stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc8ef14a638fce6a6a260ead98486f794ae944c/53_24_3447_2068/master/3447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=632557e737630f5443f928ece12c236e","title":"everton v crystal palace premier league live","story":"47 min: Jordan Pickford sends a clearance out of play and into the stand. It’s a rare kicking aberration from the England goalkeeper. 46 min: Seamus Coleman concedes an early free-kick after clattering into the back of Wilf Zaha. They’re having quite the duel this afternoon, but the Irishman is keeping the Palace winger on a very tight rein. 46 min: Play resumes, on the first of two weekends in English football featuring the Heads Together Heads Up campaign to raise awareness of mental health. Click on the link to find out more about this decidedly worthy venture. Peep! A fairly forgettable half is put out of its misery, the only moments of quality having been Bernard’s sweet volley on 18 minutes and Everton substitute Djibril Sidibe having to return to the dressing room because he had forgotten to put on one of his socks.45+3 min: Everton teammates Morgan Schneiderlin and Yerry Mina have a frank exchange of views over something or other, with the former poking the latter vigorously in the chest with his finger.45+2 min: Patrick van Aanholt shoots high and wide after receiving a cushioned pass from Christian Benteke on the edge of the Everton penalty area.45 min: A half very low on quality nears its close, as the fourth official signals three minutes of added time to make up for the break in play when Theo Walcott required treatment before going off. 43 min: Pickford comes for the ball, claims it and then loses it in a penalty area challenge with Wilf Zaha. The Palace winger scrambles to his feet in a bid to chase the loose ball and promptly goes to ground as he tussles for it with Seamus Coleman. He appeals for a penalty, but none is forthcoming. That seems fair enough to me, having seen a replay. 42 min: A Patrick van Aanholt back-pass to his own goalkeeper comes up short, due to the wind, forcing Guaita to hare out of his penalty area and hack it clear under extreme pressure from Richarlison. 41 min: Crystal Palace have improved a bit in recent minutes, but still don’t look like scoring. 40 min: Having stood in opposing dug-outs for the first time in Italy back 1996, Carlo Ancelotti and Roy Hodgson are enjoying a nice chat on the touchline. 39 min: Jordan Ayew sends a cross in from the left after good work by Sidibe to win the ball. He aims for Christian Benteke, but Michael Keane heads clear. 37 min: Joel Ward is penalised for hand ball in a tussle with Richarlison. Free-kick for Everton, about 40 yards from the Everton goal. Lucas Digne sends the ball into the mixer, where Ward clears.35 min: Palace get the ball out of their own half for what seems like the first time in their age, but Ayew is dispossessed by a crunching tackle from Coleman. 34 min: The pressure from Everton is practically relentless at this stage, with their visitors severely under the cosh. Palace are not playing with any kind of urgency and are doing little more than hanging, trying to weather the storm at the moment.33 min: Seamus Coleman curls the ball towards the far post from deep, trying to pick out Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Palace clear. 31 min: Lucas Digne dribbles along the front of the Palace penalty area, only to be dispossessed by Joel Ward before he can take a shot. 29 min: According to BT Sport’s Des Kelly, Djibril Sidibe went back to the dressing room because he had forgotten one of his socks. How on earth do you forget to put on a sock? 27 min: Moments after that Calvert-Lewin chance, Djibril emerged from the tunnel and has now dignified his fellow combatants with his presence. He’s on for Theo Walcott, who has pulled up lame. 26 min: Having knocked a Seamus Coleman delivery to Bernard, Dominic Calvert-Lewin lifts himself off the ground and flings himself goalwards, trying to convert the return pass. He can’t reach it. 25 min: Or is he? Sidibe either needs to visit the toilet or has forgotten something. He heads for the tunnel, leaving Carlo Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson looking furious. 23 min: Having provided the assist for Everton’s opener, Theo Walcott appears to be struggling with injury. He’s going to come off and be replaced by Djibril Sidibe. 22 min: Calvert-Lewini tries to play the ball past Joel Ward into the path of Richarlison, but the Crystal Palace defender stretches to intercept.19 min: Everton get their noses in front, capitalising on an error by Wilfried Zaha. He lost possession not too far outside his own penalty area, Walcott took the ball wide of Van Aanholt and then curled in a wonderful cross. It dropped beautifully for Bernard, whose side-footed finish from eight yards could not have been any sweeter. Everton take the lead! Theo Walcott curls a wonderful cross in from the left after a mistake in possession by Wilf Zaha and Bernard clips a wonderful half-volley past Guaita to put his side a goal up. 16 min: Palace win a free-kick wide on the right and Milivojevic curls the ball towards the far post, aiming for Christian Benteke., Jordan Pickford comes off his line to claim confidently. 15 min: Palace hoof it long and a back-pedalling Michael Keane does well to head the bouncing ball clear under extreme pressure from Jordan Ayew. 13 min: Patrick van Aanholt cuts into the Everton penalty area from the right and unleashes a low shot. It takes a wicked deflection off Theo Walcott before hitting the post and going out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece.12 min: Crystal Palace win a corner, Michael Keane doing well to tackle Christian Benteke as he cantered into the Everton penalty area. Gary Cahill gets a near post flick-on, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin intercepts. Everton clear the danger.11 min: Having won the free-kick, Lucas Digne floats the ball in to the penalty from deep, trying to pick out Yerry Mina at the far post. The big Colombian wins the header, but is unable to direct it goalwards. 9 min: James McCarthy is booked for a decidedly robust challenge on Lucas Digne. He slid in and got the ball, but took out the Everton defender in the process. There’s a VAR check to see if the challenge is more deserving of a red, but it remains a booking.9 min: Good work from Seamus Coleman, who gets tight on Zaha and puts the ball out of play for a throw-in as Palace’s star man was threatening. 8 min: Patrick van Aanholt tries to play Wilfried Zaha in behind Seamus Coleman and into the penalty area, but his pass is wayward and Jordan Pickford is first to the ball. 6 min: Jordan Ayew picks up the ball on the edge of the final third, but is tackled by Lucas Digne, who incurs a minor injury in the process. He picks himself off the ground and carries on. 5 min: Everton advance up the pitch with Gylfi Sigurdsson on the ball. The atmosphere at Goodison Park seems remarkably subdued in these early stages, meaning the shouts of the players on the field clearly audible. 3 min: Lucas Digne shoots for goal from the free-kick, his drive bouncing in front of Guaita as the goalkeeper es to his right to save. 2 min: Gary Cahill is caught in possession at the back by Dominic Calvert-Lewin and fouls the Everton striker as he tries to retrieve it. Free-kick for Everton about 30 years from the Palace goal, where Vicente Guaita’s vision is being impaired by the sun in his eyes.1 min: It’s a windy day on Merseyside as play gets under way, with Palace getting the ball rolling. Everton’s players wear their customary home kit of blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. Their visitors wear navy shirts, shorts and socks. Not long now: The teams make their way out on to the Goodison Park pitch for one of just four top flight games being played this weekend, what with the other 12 top flight teams currently enjoying their winter break. The players go through the last of the pre-match formalities and kick-off is just a couple of minutes away. Carlo Ancelotti speaks: “We need more of everything,” said Everton’s manager on the subject of his four changes. “More quality, more intensity, more pressure, more concentration. It’s not easy to pick the line-up but I want everyone to be involved and the players accept my decisions. Crystal Palace are a good team with lots of different qualities but we want to focus on our game today. We hope to take the initiative and play a fantastic match.”Roy Hodgson speaks: Asked if he would pick Vicente Guaita following the goalkeeping error that cost Crystal Palace three points against Sheffield United last week, Roy Hodgson was adamant the Spaniard would start today.“You don’t drop first-choice goalkeepers because they’ve made one mistake,” he said. “It can happen to anyone. We’re very happy with him and very happy he’s playing today.” While Roy Hodgson names an identical side to the one that lost against Sheffield United last weekend, Carlo Ancelotti has made four changes following his team’s come-from-behind win against Watford.As previously mentioned, Fabian Delph is suspended and replaced by Morgan Schneiderlin, while Seamus Coleman and Michael Keane come into defence for Djibril Sidibe and Mason Holgate. Alex Iwobi also drops to the bench to make way for Bernard. Everton will be without Fabian Delph, who is serving a one-match suspension and will sit this game out on the Naughty Step following his red card against Watford last weekend. Andre Gomes and Jan-Philippe Gbamin are long term absentees, although Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that Gomes is nearing a surprisingly early return from the horrific ankle injury he suffered during Everton’s draw with Spurs in November. The midfielder might be fit enough to make Everton’s squad for their match against Arsenal on 23 February.On loan at Palace from Everton, the Turkish striker Cenk Tosun is ineligible for this game against his parent club, but would have missed out anyway due to a hamstring problem. Centre-back Mamadou Sakho remains sidelined with a hip injury, while left-back Jeffrey Schlupp has a hip injury and has not played since early December.Had it not been for the stoppage-time implosion against Newcastle Carlo Ancelotti would be seeking his fourth win in four home matches as Everton manager. Having overseen the club’s first comeback victory in the Premier League for over two years last weekend, however, and with 10 men at Watford, he had no complaints over the response.Palace lack that momentum, with no wins in 2020, only three victories in the last 17 league games and an underwhelming transfer window fuelling frustration around Selhurst Park, yet only three points separate these sides.The first of today’s two Premier League matches kick off at Goodison Park, where Everton host Crystal Palace in today’s lunchtime fixture. Just three points separate the sides, but Palace will draw level with Everton on 30 points if they can beat them today. Kick-off on Merseyside is at 12.30pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a83d87670e998b14823d04e9e20a0a5317d745/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecbc7d36c6afd69c43e6123914189f79","title":"blind date elle ben","story":"What were you hoping for?A great date, a great anecdote, or both.First impressions?Oops, should have dressed up more…What did you talk about?The Blind Date meta-commentary: how was your photoshoot?

This is what it taught meIf you have siblings, the chances are that your relationship with them will be the longest you ever have with anyone. It’s a tie that precedes the one you have with you partner, and that can last long after your parents and friends have gone.So why is so little attention paid to the brother and sister bond? The majority of sibling self-help books are aimed at parents who have young children locked in rivalry. Very little is written for adult siblings on how to maintain a healthy relationship. Michelle Qureshi, a London-based therapist, tells me she has seen a rise in the number of people seeking sibling counselling. “People no longer stay in the same area or live close to their extended families,” she says. “Busy schedules mean we don’t see each other as often as we used to. Sibling relationships can be intense and we set high expectations on them – so when they break, they can be difficult to resolve.”I have some experience in this area. I’m the eldest of six, ning a decade and then some. My siblings have added to the texture of my life, brought me joy and irritation, as well as the kind of worry that can only emerge from unconditional love. These are some of the things I’ve learned about the key stages of what I call sibship, after 40 years sharing my life with my brothers and sisters.My memories of early childhood are a blur of laughter, fights and chases around the house with my younger brother and sister, Zafar and Fozia. Now my own boys are the same: a whirlwind of energy, they wake each other at 6am, usually violently and noisily. The elder two are equal parts best friends and nemeses. The baby occasionally crawls into the ring to be met with an accidental flying foot and a cuddle.Sibship at this age is a CBeebies version of Mission Impossible: the world is full of intrigue and excitement this is the age of hatching plans and whispering secrets. Your relationships are linear. Your place within the hierarchy is clear, and decided by age, like it or not.Dr Sheila Redfern, a consultant child and adolescent clinical psychologist at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in London, says these early relationships contribute hugely to our sense of self. “Children who are placed into foster homes together do better, even in difficult circumstances. You recover from trauma more easily if you have shared experiences. Even if they don’t get on, the effect is not any less positive.”For me, my siblings were allies with whom I could take on the world (AKA our parents). I am still scarred by memories of my primary school’s annual May Day parade, when my mother, ignoring my protests, sent me to school as The Asian Girl. Things got worse when my brother, Zafar, started school, and joined me as The Asian Boy. There we were in our shalwar kameez, surrounded by superheroes, animals, and Roald Dahl characters. But then our younger sister, Fozia, came along, and things changed: she was stubborn, and this time Mum and Dad were outnumbered. Our demands were finally heard – we wanted actual costumes, not cultural garments. They worked feverishly through the night to provide us with outfits, which I now consider ingenious, but at the time left me mortified. I wore a vegetable sack with a sash of plastic veg and was “Miss Vegetable Of The Year”. My brother was “Sandwich Board Man”, and poor Fozia, the instigator of the revolution, was a “Modern Humpty Dumpty”, her costume a cardboard box. The bonds forged that day will last a lifetime.My sister Fozia is three years younger than me, and we wound each other up incessantly - me with my books and oversize glasses, she with her need to annoy me in every possible way. I pretty much hated her back then I definitely did not understand her.Recently, though, we were looking at a photograph of my sons. “Aww, look at him in the back with the death stare,” she said. “He wants to be just like his brother. I used to be like that. I wanted to be you. I’m sorry.”I was taken aback. It’s taken us until middle age to find common ground. But then I realised it had been there all the time, on the evenings when my parents went out, and Dad would give us £20, saying it was for emergencies. We knew that was code for “pizza” and would bring all the duvets into the living room to watch The Goonies, Indiana Jones or Mr India. The warmth of those times is still with us all.There comes a point in your 20s when life is filled with the kind of busyness that takes you away from family. New relationships, careers, exciting friends, travel: it almost feels like a rejection of the people you grew up with – and perhaps that’s the way it’s meant to be.When you’re no longer living under the same roof, it takes an effort to stay connected. Partners join the fold, and family dynamics inevitably change. If your siblings don’t get on with your partner, the distance widens.Fozia’s ex-husband created a space between us. For the 10 years she was married, I rarely called her, and visited her twice. My own early 20s were spent trying to navigate a bad marriage. I withdrew, and drifted away from my brothers and sisters. But when that marriage ended and I returned home, the old alliances were still there we didn’t need preamble and context. My siblings had grown up, too. Suddenly the age gap that had seemed so huge in childhood had narrowed, and I wanted to spend time with them.Now that we are adults, we have become a sort of cheerleading squad for each other. For the younger ones, there is someone who has already navigated the world and can brief them on it. For the older ones, we realise it isn’t all on our shoulders any more.“Don’t say that!” I’m videocalling my mum, and talking about my son’s handwriting. My brother Khizer sits on my mum’s sofa, defending my five‑year-old’s poor penmanship. My sister Khola joins him. I’m in trouble. I’ve forgotten that we are pack animals, and, while the pack looks after its own, the hierarchy shifts with the introduction of new blood. In the hierarchy of sibship, I have been downgraded: my siblings’ loyalties now lie with my children. And of course, I’m OK with this. My offspring are being watched over by the people I trust most in the world.The exhausted haze of parenthood revealed more reasons to love my siblings. Their company is the one place I can lay down my hypervigilance. They have held their breath with me as my children started school, fell sick or expressed their fears my siblings cheer on their successes. Half-term at my sister Javaria’s house means arriving to find a kitchen stocked with all my picky-eater child’s favourite foods.My boys and I spent a summer in Yorkshire, flitting between my parents’ home and my siblings’ houses, and the strength of kinship was never more evident. My children ran amok, destroyed things, and then fell asleep in the glow of family, amid conversations that have been going on for decades. From the moment they were born, it is as if they sensed that my siblings were their staunchest allies.“Well, Mum always said we’d be upset when she got cancer, and here we are,” I said. Everyone laughed – only siblings could. And when she lost her hair, thanks to chemo, my little brother, Khizer, and sister, Khola, photographed themselves in her wig and shared the images.At no time is the sibling support system more essential than when a parent gets sick. My mum was in hospital with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All six of us came together, descending from various parts of the country. “You know it is going to be OK when your big sister arrives,” my youngest sister, Khola, said as I stepped off the train at Leeds station.I was only there for a couple of weeks. Khola did all the heavy lifting: taking mum to her appointments, looking after her and making her meals. But we all knew we had to pull together. Only we knew mum’s idiosyncrasies, her need for Egyptian cotton bedsheets, a clean house, and cappuccinos that she always pronounces “car-pacino”.Mum has been cancer-free for almost seven years now, but in that moment the roles of parent and children were reversed – a reversal that gets more pronounced as we siblings progress to middle age. I remember my father running up and down the stairs of our family home when I was a child. Now, watching him take each step one at a time, I know how acutely he feels the loss of his youth. So do I.“He sends me WhatsApp messages telling me he loves me,” says my dad’s sister.My aunt is visiting, and hasn’t seen my dad in a while, but it is as if their conversation was a recording on pause, and someone has just hit play. My father was a joker in his youth, and time has subdued him. But watching him with his sister is like watching time rewind: they are young again.My mum and her siblings, scattered around the world, have a WhatsApp group where they share news of their children and grandchildren. Her phone regularly runs out of charge thanks to the continuous messaging. Thankfully, three of her sisters live close by. “Old age can be lonely,” my mum tells me, “and that’s when you realise how much you need each other. Emotional support, financial help – we offer it without being asked. I can call my sisters at any time and talk about anything. Whatever I tell them stays within the family.” Nothing, she says, compares to that feeling of being understood without explanation.One day, I hope to be old myself. And at such a time I will have five houses to go where the meals will taste like my mother’s cooking, where the generosity of spirit is the same as my father’s, and where the stories told around the kitchen table will have at their heart the values I was raised with. It turns out that sibship is the best thing my parents did for me.Let go of the baggage Get to know your sibling as the adult they are, not the child they were. Be the first to let go of a grudge – your mental health will thank you.Handle conflict kindly Language and tone matters. It’s easy to become disrespectful during an argument, or to want to blame don’t be careless.Celebrate each other’s success, but accept your own envy Sometimes you will feel jealous. Be nonjudgmental and supportive whatever happens you’re on each other’s side.Cultivate a friendship: spend quality time together away from family stress Take a class or walk together, away from children and spouses. This gives you something to talk about outside family politics.Have trusted friends outside the family circle who understand your family This helps keep things in perspective and takes the pressure off sibling relationships.Take responsibility There’s something about family that makes it harder to say sorry to a sibling than to anyone else. But it is important to apologise, as way of resolving the past and moving forward.Communicate, in real life WhatsApp groups, texting and social media make it easy to feel connected without talking. But they’re flawed means of communication it’s important to have proper conversations.• Advice by Michelle Qureshi, a registered psychotherapist practising in London.If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1012b50cd5f5888fbeaa66e9ab3adc4b91e0ae/26_47_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac26a72fc93dd560c3c5dcd072e1a7f","title":"my life in oscars parties colin firth hadley freeman","story":"The 2020 Academy Awards will be my seventh. I’ve yet to win one but I’ve brought home some great storiesWhen you read this, I will be in Los Angeles, which is nice. I love LA, which is not a sentence you hear often, especially in Britain, where the city is often derided as too shallow, too full of celebrities and too hot, none of which are negatives in my book. The British antipathy to LA is rooted in a suspicion that anything that pleasant can’t be good for you, and an experience only counts if it involves endurance. I’ve spent the past 20 summers hacking it out at British festivals, trudging through mud with a rucksack the size of a car on my back, all in the name of Fun. So the first time I went to Coachella in California’s Palm Springs I thought I was hallucinating, like when Tintin gets so dehydrated he fantasises a sparkling oasis surrounded by palm trees, because that is what Coachella looks like. As I sat on the perfect green grass, eating my acai bowl, I remembered when Brits grumped that Glastonbury was getting gentrified because there were flushable toilets. Britain’s self-image is rooted in 1970s sitcoms, whereas California believes life should be like a Hollywood movie.And sometimes it actually is. I’m out here to cover the Oscars for, I think, the seventh time. I know this is deeply uncool to admit but, hot damn, I love the Oscars. Even as a kid one of my most beloved video cassettes was called Oscars Greatest Moments, but attending them has taken matters to a new level. I’ve yet to win an Oscar, but it is at the awards where I’ve lived out some of the great movie storylines. Behold, my Oscars Greatest Moments.What I hesitate to call my relationship with Harvey Weinstein can be charted by the Oscars we attended. In 2011, I was told by one of Weinstein’s 10 million assistants that I was banned from all Oscars parties and every restaurant in Beverly Hills, due to disparaging coverage of the The Weinstein Corporation in the ’s business pages. Once I’d stopped laughing, I courageously – like a marine, really – went to an Oscars party at Soho House, where Weinstein did, indeed, try to throw me out and I, marine-style, hid in the bathroom. As we now know, I was not the first woman to have to hide from Harvey in a bathroom. A few years later, Weinstein marked Oscars day by writing an article about me for this paper, complaining that I didn’t appreciate his Baftas party enough: “Next time Hadley Freeman comes to one of our parties she should relax, loosen up, have a glass of champagne and be sure to stay the whole night and really, truly… enjoy herself.” Not creepy at all, Harv! And here we are this year – or rather, here I am, because Weinstein is otherwise engaged. Such a shock this guy turned out to have a problem with women.The year: 2015. The person: Eddie Murphy. I spot Murphy on his own at an Oscars party and start hyperventilating over him with hero worship. He, alas, is less excited to meet me and walks away. Someone then taps me on the shoulder. “Hey, don’t worry I’ll take a selfie with you,” says the man, who I vaguely remember was hanging round with Murphy earlier. I graciously allow him to take a photo with me, and fly home the next day. “Some random member of Eddie Murphy’s entourage took a selfie with me,” I tell my boyfriend, showing him the photo.Turns out it was not a random member of Murphy’s entourage – it was Kevin Hart, AKA the biggest comedian on the planet. For the proper movie ending, Kevin and I should meet again at this Oscars and get married. You know where to find me, Kevin! (Lurking creepily around Eddie Murphy.)I went to the Vanity Fair party, where I spotted someone we’ll call dorky director (DD) with Weinstein (him again) and Matt Damon. As I knew DD a bit socially, I said hi, reminding him of my name. But DD decided I was not beneficial to his Hollywood cred, so he stuck his hand in my face and said, “No press.” Weinstein and Damon were now looking at me as Eddie Murphy would a few years later, and I was speechless with shock. But Colin Firth was nearby, overheard what happened and – despite clearly having never heard my name before – said, “Hadley Freeman? I’m such a fan! Can I talk to you?” Yes, this actually happened. DD looked like someone had punched him in the face. I was Lizzie Bennet at the end of Pride And Prejudice, Bridget Jones at the end of Bridget Jones’s Diary. Roll end credits!Exciting epilogue: in revenge for my Firth triumph, DD told friends of mine that he and I had had an affair in LA but I “couldn’t handle his freakiness”. Conclusion: men are dicks. Except for Colin Firth.So I’m excited about what movie plot will unfold around me tomorrow. Time travel, perhaps? Period drama? (Nah, sounds messy.) Fingers crossed for a body-swap storyline – maybe with Colin Firth. I know he’d be an excellent sport about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/563eb80ac7c17a9595440176b1cdc6df06eb00af/0_77_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0820f44656803eb0be91aba7f65e93a","title":"bank couple lose 43000 but cant get a refund","story":"Two retirees were conned out of their savings, but the banks say they were negligentIt started with a phone call to their home landline – and ended with a police stakeout and panic alarm being fitted in their Cambridgeshire home. A retired couple who lost £43,000 to persistent and expert fraudsters have become the latest victims to complain that banks’ voluntary fraud code promising refunds to victims is worthless.In May last year, the UK’s biggest banks all agreed to abide by a new code that would see the victims of what is known as “authorised push payment fraud” refunded in full. Victims duped into sending money to an account operated by criminals were to be refunded, where they had been the victim of a complex fraud – a so-called no-blame scenario.At the time the code was hailed as a breakthrough as before then the banks were routinely blaming fraud victims, and turning down claims for refunds on the basis that people had been grossly negligent.However, a growing number of fraud victims have contacted  Money in recent months to say that nothing has changed, and that the banks are ignoring the code.The most recent are George and Pamela Ross (not their real names), who live near Cambridge. Back in November, the Rosses took a call on their home landline from someone claiming to be a bank fraud investigator, who told them that their life savings were at risk of being stolen.The couple were told staff could only discuss the details with them if they called their bank’s fraud team by phoning the number on the back of their bank cards.But the scammers were able to keep the line open during this process, using fake dialling tones, phones ringing in series, and even phone transfers, so that the elderly couple believed they had reached call centres at Halifax and Santander.They were told that the banks’ own employees were under investigation, and bosses needed their help to catch them.During the following 24 hours, the couple were “groomed” to help take down a supposed network of corrupt employees working within Halifax and Santander banks, says their daughter Sam.They were instructed not to discuss the matter with family or anyone else, and in particular the staff in the banks in question. The fraudsters kept in close contact with them over the phone – even while they attended a hospital appointment, she says.“The fraudsters were able to coerce my 75-year-old mother to visit the Cambridge branch of Halifax where she was instructed to make two transfers of £19,000 to what later turned out to be accounts at Lloyds and Barclays,” Sam says.“She believed these accounts were safe accounts set up by the investigators. My father was similarly coerced to withdraw £5,000 cash from a local Santander branch, and to hand it over to a courier for ‘fingerprint analysis’. They were both warned on approaching each bank that staff would question them in detail about scams. They were instructed to ignore this, although ironically they were not questioned in any sort of detail at all. This was in spite of the fact that these payments were completely out of keeping with their normal payments history.”Only when she happened to call her parents, who were in a highly distressed state, did the scam emerge. When Sam realised what was happening, the police were called, and to their credit, she says, they took the matter seriously.“The fraudsters had sent a courier to pick up the £5,000 in cash, and were trying to persuade my father to make a second withdrawal. The police hoped to catch them at it, and my father was instructed to play along. A second withdrawal was set to be picked up at their house. A parcel of marked bank notes was handed over and the village was flooded with plain clothes officers.“However, no arrest was made. My brother turned up at my parents’ house by chance and was grabbed by the police. They then swooped on another innocent person, at which point the fraudsters must have realised the game was up. Their phone calls stopped abruptly, and they got away. My parents were left fearing there could be reprisals, meaning a panic alarm had to be installed in their home,” says Sam.She says the police have confirmed this was a particularly sophisticated scam. She has asked Halifax and Santander to refund the money, but both have refused.However, this case raises difficult questions. To what extent can the banks be liable in situations such as this? Despite the police’s rare involvement in a bank fraud case, both Halifax and Santander argued that the couple were to blame.This week Commander Karen Baxter, who leads the City of London police’s economic crime unit, told Radio 4 that this “despicable” crime, which sees victims skilfully “groomed”, has jumped recently. In January, police arrested 44 people suspected of this crime recovering a huge quantity of cash, she said.One of the problems that fraud victims have encountered is that the code states that only “no-blame” customers will be refunded. The banks are supposed to be more sympathetic to older victims, but rarely are.The Financial Ombudsman Service has told banks they should refund victims – citing an almost identical scenario to this case.A Halifax spokesman says: “We have a great deal of sympathy, and a decision not to provide a refund is never one which is taken lightly. Sadly our customers did not take sufficient steps to verify the identity of the cold-caller, and also ignored a specific warning from our branch about exactly this type of scam.“Your bank or police will never ask you to move money to a ‘safe account’. We understand our customers have asked the Financial Ombudsman Service to consider their case, and we will of course fully cooperate with any review.”Santander, though, has since decided to refund the couple. “Santander has the utmost sympathy for this couple and all those who fall victim to scams,” it says. “Following a review of the specific circumstances of this case we have agreed to refund the £5,000 that was withdrawn in branch.” It noted that cash withdrawals are not covered by the code.Meanwhile, Sam asks what more could have been done.“My parents were scam aware. If I did not know that scammers could fake dialling tones and bank call centres, how could they be expected to?” she says.• UK Finance, the banks’ representative body, has said long-awaited changes to interbank payments that come into force on 31 March should massively reduce APP fraud. After this date, the account holder’s name will be matched with the person that is being paid – for the first time. Until now, users could put Mickey Mouse into the name box on an online transfer and the payment would go through. From April the name will be shown – exposing the fraudster’s account is not in the victim’s name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0ca7541ea1de120aefd9dbefabe1fdbef34f80/0_10_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c456c011e1b691f2ff95f174a1e108e","title":"britains buy to let boom is over we should rejoice","story":"The number of landlords with multiple properties is falling as cuts to tax relief biteThe two decades of fat, lazy profits made on the backs of squeezing as much rental cash as possible out of young adults while smugly sitting on vast unearned house price gains look to be over. This April the final phase of the tax changes on buy-to-let income comes into force, and the good news is that landlords are giving up on the game.HMRC data obtained by accountants Moore this week show that the number of buy-to-let landlords with multiple properties fell in 2017-18 to 157,000 from 159,000 the year before. The fall may be slight, but it’s important, as it marks the first decline since the financial crisis.The figures are for the latest period for which figures are available – and when the cuts to tax relief were only just beginning to bite. Since 2017-18, they have accelerated, making it almost certain that more and more landlords have withdrawn from the market.The tax attack on buy-to-let has been quite remarkable, all the more so considering it was initiated by a Tory chancellor, George Osborne.Take the example of a landlord with a buy-to-let who is picking up £950 a month in rent, but paying a mortgage of £600 a month.Since April 2017 the ability to deduct interest against tax has been cut every year, and from April 2020 it finally disappears. For our landlord with the £950 a month rental income, his after-tax profit in 2017 would have been £2,520. From this April it will be £1,080.That leaves very little for repairs and maintenance and, if the tenant leaves and there is just one month’s “void” in rental income, then the profit disappears altogether.Charging letting fees to tenants has also been banned, plus there’s a new cap on deposits. No-fault evictions are also on the way out.You could almost shed a tear for landlords, the vast majority of whom are perfectly decent property managers and owners. The minority who are “rogue” landlords are more than matched by the minority of rogue tenants. But the landlords who wail “It’s my pension” should show humility their pension is just a transfer from young adults, many of whom are having to give across half their income to the landlord. What about their pension? What about their chances of ever getting on the property ladder?Landlords who bought during the boom years are sitting on large capital gains, the product of monetary policy, land scarcity and population growth, and virtually nothing to do with their own endeavours. The “problem” I hear from some landlords is that they want to sell up, but will be hit with a large CGT bill. What a distressing situation to be in. Large unearned profits, on which they may have to pay some tax.What the buy-to-let episode shows is that policy matters. The explosion in buy-to-let was not a “natural” phenomenon – it was a product of legal changes in the 1990s (the assured shorthold tenancy) married to a tax regime that favoured landlords. The result was entirely predictable home ownership began to fall, not just among the young but increasingly among middle-aged people as well. Property wealth shifted into fewer and fewer hands.Since the change in buy-to-let taxation, the result has also been entirely predictable the fall in home ownership has stabilised, and may be on the turn. There is a tendency to view the property market in fatalistic terms there’s nothing we can do about prices, building, demand and so on. But we can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3646ba391ff6b8b244e3a70aef3a78e3859a36/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7123b968311a8ff8d0fbda18204341","title":"should i buy a manual petrol car or automatic hybrid","story":"My children are likely to learn to drive on it – and I’m wondering if the era of geared cars is overEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’d like to buy a hybrid car but they’re nearly all automatics.

And the Barbican delivers two unforgettable days of wall-to-wall BeethovenAnyone who views opera as a rarefied pastime should gatecrash a schools matinee. On Monday lunchtime at the Royal Opera House, the roar in the auditorium, pre-curtain-up for Gerald Barry’s Alice’s Adventures Under Ground, was as raucous as any playground. The collective “ooh” as the lights went down, and “aah” as the red velvet curtain came up made you wish all ROH audiences were as excitedly engaged, but on the whole they’re not year 4s (eight- and nine-year-olds). Schools, or parents, paid £7.50 per ticket, thanks to support from the Taylor Family Foundation and the Gerald and Gail Ronson Family Foundation, who surely deserve mention for their low-profile but vital philanthropy.I was seated next to 90 children from Grays, Essex, who immediately, together with the rest of the auditorium, fell quiet at the sight of Alice (soprano Jennifer France) tumbling down, down, within a Pollock-style Victorian theatre, only to be confronted by giant-sized Drink Me bottles and Eat Me cakes. As the music raced and screeched in crazed scales and arpeggios, so Alice fought back with a mayhem of stratospherically high, ridiculous, show-off top Cs – apparently 30 of them – in the first minutes of music. Who knows what trouble Barry (b1952) got up to at his County Clare primary school.This was the world’s first encounter with his version of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass in a full staging, before its opening night last Tuesday. Given a memorable concert premiere at the Barbican in 2016, it was conducted then, as now, by Thomas Adès, Barry’s friend and advocate. The composer has compressed Carroll’s best episodes, languid in comparison, into condensed matter of the most ear-popping, eye-popping variety.The director-designer Antony McDonald, whose previous work includes the Royal Opera’s Hansel and Gretel and The Importance of Being Earnest (also by Barry and arguably even madder), might be the only person undaunted by the challenges of this nonstop, whirlwind fantasy. Mad Hatter, Mock Turtle, Red Knight, White Knight, Red Queen, White Queen, Tweedles -dum and -dee: all whistle by, each a glimpse, gone for ever. One fabulous costume is shed, another worn, with speed and finesse. The whole event lasts barely an hour.Barry’s Alice is a true comedy, rare in opera – once you name Rossini, Donizetti, the Puccini of Gianni Schicchi, you have to stop and think – but its humour, for adults, is based on brilliant subversion of the familiar: of Carroll, of musical styles (Wagner, Verdi, Beethoven, music hall are wittily present), of language, of foolish human behaviour. Translating Jabberwocky into doggerel Russian, French and German is sillier and funnier if you know how silly and funny the original is. To say the young audience maintained a quizzical silence – except when Robert Murray as the eloquent Messenger, among his nine other roles, engaged in some high-speed bum waggling – isn’t to suggest they weren’t attentive. They were, impressively. But as Adès has said, Barry is “in the innovative line of the great Irish artists, Joyce, Beckett, Flann O’Brien” – writers who may not have made it on to the year 4 syllabus.However innocent their eye, they surely appreciated the magic and theatricality of this staging, and certainly roared approval when the end arrived. France’s Alice, Nicky Spence’s captivating White Rabbit, Alan Ewing’s melancholic Humpty Dumpty, with Allison Cook, Carole Wilson and Stephen Richardson, were nimble and heroic in the first of two casts. The Royal Opera orchestra, brass especially, entered Barry’s zany musical world with wildness and velocity. Adès kept all, including the important silences, under military control, right until the melancholy end. The following night, the other cast, led by Claudia Boyle as Alice, and pulling with equal weight, stirred plenty of chuckles from the adult audience, but this time the children present, prompted by the grownups’ example, realised they were allowed to laugh, and did.Humpty Dumpty’s forlorn intoning of the Ode to Joy, sung to Carroll’s words “In winter when the fields are white, I sing this song for your delight”, is one of Barry’s many and loving tributes to Beethoven. You only have to recall Beethoven’s own musical jokes to imagine how he would have enjoyed the later composer’s irony: try the cartoon extremes of variation 13 of the Diabelli Variations as a start. Beethoven blamed his seeming curmudgeonliness on his growing deafness, already fully in evidence by the age of 30, the time of his Symphony No 2. An example of one of his ear trumpets, a grotesque, cumbersome metal contraption – on show at the Barbican as part of a touring exhibition from the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn – must haunt any mind or imagination. Yet Symphony No 2 bursts with optimism and radiance, as the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, under their music director Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla, demonstrated so vigorously at the Barbican’s Beethoven Weekender.This coming together of the UK’s regional orchestras – never before under one roof, as far as anyone could recall – was an inspired celebration of Beethoven in his 250th birthday year. It’s impossible to convey every aspect of a full two days that ranged from a soft play Baby Beethoven Squish Space to recorded birdsong in the Barbican Conservatory, as well as all nine symphonies. As fringe activities, repeated through the sold-out weekend (a bargain £45 all-in), Simon Callow read the composer’s letters with the excellent Carducci Quartet performing Gerard McBurney introduced the often witty gems that are Beethoven’s piano Bagatelles, with pianist Christopher Park and Sarah Mohr-Pietsch shared the awe-inspiring secrets of Beethoven’s own, honey-toned violin, played by Daniel Sepec, with Tai Murray performing, in contrast, on a modern violin.The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra launched the weekend proper, under their chief conductor Vasily Petrenko, with elegant, nuanced accounts of Symphonies 5 and 6, and some remarkable pianissimo string playing. Then the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, with Kirill Karabits, uncorked the fizzing energy of No 1 and the contrasting sobriety and wit, turbulence and anarchy of No 3 “Eroica”. On Saturday evening, to end the day, and without worrying about any numerical harness, the CBSO paired the two least familiar symphonies, Nos 2 and 4: check out their electrifying performance of these works (from Birmingham), now on BBC Sounds.On Sunday, the smaller forces of the Royal Northern Sinfonia – an orchestra I don’t know as well as I should – made light of Beethoven’s own beloved, the Eighth, and stormed through the terrors of No 7. Their conductor, Lars Vogt, also a star pianist who has directed the concertos from the keyboard, has a way of giving modest gestures, a curve of the hand, a slight bend of the knees, yet eliciting quickfire results. No wonder this wonderful ensemble got such particular cheers after the hair-raising finale of the Seventh.Lastly came the Hallé Orchestra, conducted by Mark Elder, who brought wisdom and magnificence to the Ninth, with an accomplished quartet of soloists and the Hallé Choir, without scores, singing the Ode to Joy with belting fervour. Many of us were there all weekend. The ovation was, in part, for the Ninth, for its invention and ingenuity, as well as for its wider associations and resonances. Chiefly, the long applause was for the whole event, and the limitless, humanistic genius of Beethoven.Star ratings (out of five) Alice’s Adventures Under Ground ★★★★★ Beethoven Weekender ★★★★★• Alice’s Adventures Under Ground is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 9 February• All nine Beethoven symphonies will be repeated at the Sage Gateshead’s Big Beethoven Weekend 1 (with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra replacing the CBSO), 22-23 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/603374c0ee59eb4302ba9f17af941cbaacec1e45/105_181_3244_1946/master/3244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae288e8d53f53b429f7e48a4a58725ef","title":"george osborne evening standard editor talks","story":"Exclusive: former chancellor expected to leave role amid shakeup by new chief executive, sources sayGeorge Osborne’s future at the Evening Standard is believed to be in doubt, with sources at the newspaper expecting the former chancellor to leave the publication.Osborne was appointed to edit the daily London newspaper in March 2017 and since then has continued to juggle the job with several other roles, including a £650,000-a-year post advising the investment fund BlackRock, and as chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership.Amid rampant speculation over the editor’s future among staff, the Evening Standard did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday afternoon.Sources at the newspaper said the publication was changing direction under its new chief executive, Mike Soutar – the founder of the free magazine Shortlist who joined the Evening Standard at the end of last year – as he seeks to reduce financial losses of £11m a year.The newspaper, which distributes 800,000 copies a day across London, has been hit hard by the decline in print advertising revenue. Its free distribution model means that it has high fixed costs, which cannot be offset with price rises. At the same time the outlet is facing the challenge of 4G mobile phone signal coming to the London Underground, giving readers an alternative to reading a print newspaper.The company has been pushing investment in its website while having to make job cuts and several long-serving staff members have departed.A key issue facing the Evening Standard is the role of its owner, the Russian businessman Evgeny Lebedev, and his willingness to subsidise the operation. The company’s accounts say the losses mean the outlet “requires continuous financial support from the shareholders”.A minority stake in the Evening Standard’s parent company was bought at the end of December 2017 by an offshore Cayman Islands company that turned out to be ultimately controlled by a Saudi Arabian state bank.This led to a failed attempt by the British government to investigate what they termed “unconventional, complex and clandestine” deals to enable Saudi investment in the Evening Standard and the Independent, a sister title. also revealed that Lebedev has hosted a private dinner for Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman.The newspaper groups eventually won the court case on the basis that the British government did not have the legal right to intervene."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e713c85e14b66188706f731ebc5b1df26334a1fe/36_546_2984_1791/master/2984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0df965737b5a82cbe0d0ad34f739b3c","title":"labours canvassing strategy had major deficiencies leaked report says","story":"Opportunity to increase vote share in marginals was missed due to ineffective grassroots operation, analysis showsA damning internal report into Labour’s on-the-ground election campaign has revealed activists did not have enough campaign material, were poorly prepared to talk about policy on the doorstep and did not target the right marginal seats.The leaked analysis by a Labour staffer, produced for senior party figures, found that officials were not in the right parts of the country to run an effective strategy, despite the fact that door-to-door campaigning increases turnout for Labour.And though Labour is the largest political party in Europe, the report – seen by the  – suggests it needs to expand its membership even further if it is to swing decisive seats in future elections.“Discussions with activists reveal … major deficiencies in the running of the campaign,” the report reveals. “These include poor quality and late delivery of printed materials, lack of communication and preparation over key policy lines, lack of clarity on how campaigns could secure the data of newly registered voters, the unreliability of digital tools, and inadequate training of activists.“Therefore there is clearly major room for improvement in the effectiveness of on-the-ground campaigning.”A Labour source said: “What this report shows is that canvassing does work and it does help but the party was not really well organised and there were basic deficiencies that activists weren’t getting data and there should have been different approaches to conversations at different points in the campaign. But there is statistical proof that canvassing works.”The report is one of a number of critical election postmortems for the Labour party, which returned its worst result since 1935.So far an analysis presented to the party’s National Executive Committee found that the poor election performance was down to the party leadership’s decision to back a second Brexit referendum and that too many policies were released on a daily basis throughout the election period.It did not blame the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who they suggested had been the victim of unrelenting attacks on his character.Organisation Labour Together – which is being backed by the party’s former leader Ed Miliband and the Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell – has so far had feedback from 8,000 people. Early findings showed that voters did not like the party’s policies, and that the campaign was inefficient and beset with technical difficulties.However, this fresh report seen by the  is the first statistical analysis of how conversations with voters correlated to vote share for the party in inidual seats.As party members dissect the election result, activists who went door-to-door are keen for the role of canvassing to be recognised by the party centrally as a powerful way to secure votes and that it should be improved in time for the next election.They suggest more work needs to be done on the types of conversations to have with voters at different stages of the campaign. There were complaints that in some seats there was only a “voter ID” stage, which is when activists go house to house to gather if anyone might be a Labour supporter. Instead there needed to be more focus on the “get the vote out” phase and countering opponents’ attack lines.A Labour party spokesman said: “The National Executive Committee is collecting evidence from all teams and sections of the party for a detailed review of our election campaign and the result.“We are committed to learning the lessons when that review is complete.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258e2aa2b6dda500e28812acaf85d4f473063b57/85_65_1657_994/master/1657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7f9e17cc94308cfeae16b1684c87882","title":"tracy brabin shouldergate dress ebay charity","story":"Proceeds from online auction of House of Commons dress to go to Girlguiding charity Bids on an off-the-shoulder dress worn by Tracy Brabin in the House of Commons have passed £12,000 in a charity auction.The Labour MP was forced to defend her attire after the dress slipped off her shoulder when she leaned on the dispatch box because of a broken ankle on Tuesday.Brabin decided to sell the dress for charity on eBay, where bids reached £12,600 on Saturday morning.The auction ends on Thursday and the money raised will go to Girlguiding, a charity for girls and young women in the UK.Brabin’s outfit had been criticised on social media earlier in the week.

She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there’s nothing to disturb them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama.China’s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country – a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise – as well as 24,702 suspected cases.Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.If you’ve been affected and would like to share your experience or news tips, anonymously if you prefer, direct with our journalists then please do so via the form below.

Watch the Donald Trump impeachment trial? That’s how Vickii Cornborough and Shaunagh Brown prepared for last Sunday’s 19-13 win against France. “Everybody else went out to a restaurant, but me and Shaunagh thought we should just have a night in and cook our own food,” Cornborough says. “We watched the impeachment trial.” Brown says. “It was a great evening.”In the shadows of the Pyrenees in Pau, south-western France, Cornborough entered the field as a 48th-minute replacement to win her 50th England cap. The prop, named in the starting XV for Sunday’s meeting with Scotland, reflects on the milestone after a gruelling training session of almost two hours.“Going into France I geed myself up so much that it was just the same as every other game and I didn’t expect there to be much fuss over it,” she says. “But the support was overwhelming.”A proud day for the Cornborough family, but were they there to witness it? “No, my parents are retired and they spend half the year abroad so they were on holiday in Spain,” says Cornborough with a laugh. “But when I arrived home on Monday, the house was dark and as I opened the door all of my friends and family were there for a surprise party.”England became the first international women’s team to offer full-time professional contracts in January 2019, with 28 players signed up, which has had a significant impact on Cornborough and her teammates. “I thought it would forever be a pipe dream for rugby to be my full-time job,” she says.“I was always told rugby is for fun but go out and get another job. For me to live in that dream and see the next generation of kids coming through and how it can be your career is unbelievable, it gives me goose bumps. It’s provided stability so I can focus the majority of my time and effort in rugby.”Cornborough missed the autumn internationals because of injury but appreciates how the contract has helped her recovery. “For my mental health and sanity, it was such a good thing for me to be able to be around my teammates. I was working every day rehabbing and the resources I had access to – doctors, physios, a full-time strength and conditioning coach who guided every session. I wouldn’t have had that or been able to put that amount of effort in if I wasn’t full-time.”Cornborough and Brown reflect a jovial atmosphere within the squad, regularly joking together. All players share rooms, however Cornborough is a “nomad”, meaning she does not have a regular roommate, yet they are eager to avoid one teammate in particular. “Nobody wants to be with Rowena Burnfield,” says Cornborough with a laugh. “She’s a snorer and consequently has her own room sometimes,” says Brown.Apart from impeachment trials, players relax by playing the Nintendo Switch, but despite being a champion rugby player, Cornborough’s performances are substandard. “It’s like playing with your mum, she’s like an old lady,” says Brown.Cornborough retorts: “I’m always last but it was canoeing the other day and it’s knackering, you’re trying to canoe as fast as possible and then you’ve got to do it in time. It’s so stressful and I’m not very good at not being good at something.”Cornborough still works as an IT business development manager around her rugby schedule and sees similarities between the jobs. “From work into rugby I bring my organisational skills, determination and ability to lead,” she says. “From rugby into work it’s the ability to work in a team. It’s one thing I don’t think people naturally do well in if they’re not from a sporting background. Success on the pitch is scoring points and closing out games and for business it’s closing deals. This is the same thing, just different objectives.”Dates for the 2021 World Cup in New Zealand were announced this week and Cornborough is thrilled. “To prep for the World Cup full-time will be amazing. 2017’s tournament had some of my biggest highs and lows. I don’t think I will ever get over losing the final.”Before then Cornborough will marry her fiance, Will, who proposed in August. He plays for Havant as a flanker and the pair met when they joined the same team as youngsters. It then took another 10 years before encountering each other again in a bar. The wedding, which Cornborough jokes Brown is yet to RSVP to, includes guests from 10 rugby teams.“I had to ring up the England coaches to go: ‘Excuse me, I’d like to get married this summer can we have a look at the calendar, what day can I get married please?’” says Cornborough. “And then I called Will and went: ‘Right, I’ve got a date.’”Cornborough is clearly a well‑respected member of the squad and someone Brown admires. “She’s an inspiration,” says Brown. “It’s such an honour to play alongside her, everything she does is for the team. She is one of, if not the best, looseheads in the world.”Katy Daly-McLean, scorer of more than 500 England points, agrees: “To get 50 caps as a prop is sensational.”Cornborough is humble despite Scotland not beating England since 1998 and last year being on the receiving end of an 80-0 drubbing by the Red Roses. “There are loads of threats in Scotland’s team we must be mindful of and we need to play to our strengths to overcome those,” she says. “The level of all the teams is up. It’s going to be a difficult rest of the competition, so all bets are on. I’ve still got so many more things I want to achieve in an England shirt and I’m nowhere near done yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b8d97ca900625ac341daf2b617379f02368ff4/0_75_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e0489440a049366d25a6bf42de6e257","title":"ireland v wales six nations 2020 live","story":"Don’t forget - you can contact me on email or on Twitter if you have any pre-match thoughts, or indeed any during-match thoughts. Hit me!Did you know: Wales prop Dillon Lewis drinks seven cups of coffee a day.Paul Rees spoke to him ahead of today’s match: Andy Farrell makes two changes for Ireland. Peter O’Mahony comes into the back row in place of Caelan Doris, who was concussed on debut last week. O’Mahony plays No 6 with CJ Stander at No 8. Robbie Henshaw comes into the centres in place of the injured Garry Ringrose.Nick Tompkins came off the bench for Wales against Italy - and impressed enough to force his way into Wayne Pivac’s starting XV today. That means George North is back on the wing, having started at centre last week, while Johnny McNicholl is on the bench.A storm is brewing in Ireland, but no-one knows exactly when it will hit. For a match between two sides aiming to add a fresh unpredictability to their respective attacking games, it seems a convenient metaphor.Both these teams know each other well, but both are operating under new head coaches who are looking to tweak well-established models. Both of them kicked off with victory last week: Ireland prevailed in an arm wrestle with Scotland, while Wales thrashed Italy 42-0 in Cardiff. Ireland under new head coach Andy Farrell are still finding their feet - hoping to emerge from that downbeat conclusion to Joe Schmidt’s successful tenure. Farrell observed in midweek that he thought his players had been ‘too creative’ in their opening victory against Scotland - which doesn’t fill you with hope that his team will be looking to entertain today - although it was Farrell’s way of saying that their decision-making had not been up to scratch.Pivac’s Wales arrive in Dublin hoping for a record-equalling ninth consecutive victory in the competition. That demolition of Italy came against a relatively accommodating defence, but Pivac’s new emphasis on attack allied to the defensive solidity established under Warren Gatland was clear to see. As Paul Rees wrote earlier this week: “Wales are not looking to trade in a trusty model that does not break down but inject the engine with a turbo.” One of Farrell and Pivac will almost certainly taste defeat for the first time in their new jobs in a few hours.Wales fly-half Dan Biggar predicted this will be ‘one for the purists’ if Storm Ciara hits the Irish capital in time for this afternoon’s match. Didn’t he mean ‘not one for the purists’? Regardless, the weather is going to play a part. Let’s hope for some exciting rugby. Teams and much more coming up very shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9f55c93a3c0c3e69872ef59c66c377913bbc9f/117_1330_5438_3263/master/5438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420d9629c421e07699cd5990f5cf3a11","title":"sheila atim impostor syndrome mbe bbc debut agatha christie pale horse","story":"The actor has channelled Bob Dylan and received an honour at just 29. Now she’s finally ready for primetimeSheila Atim would not call it a shrine, exactly, but in her London flat, there is a mantelpiece on which she has placed a few commemorative bits and bobs. There’s an Olivier award here, an MBE there. “My friend did say it looked like a shrine,” she admits, laughing. “But it’s not because I want people to walk into the flat and be blinded by the lights of Sheila’s achievements. These things are just nice! They’re little milestones. I look at them and go, whoa. What?!”There’s a lovely, knockabout energy to Atim, balanced by a deeply serious side. More than almost anyone I’ve interviewed, she really, properly, thoroughly considers every angle of every question she is asked, as if she’s been set a puzzle to solve. Perhaps that’s why casting agents spot a kind of otherworldliness in her. “A little bit, not bang in the middle of the mainstream, just slightly to the left,” as she puts it. Atim has been a powerful presence in the theatre world: she won the Olivier in 2018 for her role in the Bob Dylan-inspired musical Girl From The North Country, and has done almost every interesting, just-slightly-to-the-left production of Shakespeare going. Then, in December, she was awarded the MBE – at the age of 29. Now she’s moving on to the small screen with a BBC primetime debut in which she’ll be playing a witch. In The Pale Horse, a list of names is found on the body of a woman who has been murdered a man who finds his own name there becomes obsessed with a trio of spooky women in a leafy suburban village. It’s an Agatha Christie adaptation, which means Atim can’t tell me anything else about it. “It’s quite hard, isn’t it, with a whodunnit? But I am playing a witch. That much I can tell you.”It will be her first time as a witch, other than a stab at Macbeth in drama classes. “But I’ve played lots of ethereal characters. Or characters who have a supernatural element, or are ambiguous as to whether they’re real or incorporeal.” Why does she think she gets those parts? In person, Atim is wiry, eager and sharp, and lacks the wafty vagueness that “ethereal” conjures. We meet on a freezing cold night and sit in a photographic studio in an old railway arch, huddled around a radiator, wrapped in coats and scarves. Every now and then a train rumbles overhead, adding a touch of the theatrical whenever the conversation turns introspective.“I tend to be quite a pensive person, I guess,” Atim says. “I ruminate a lot and can be quite quiet when you first meet me, so I think that makes people think, ooh, something’s going on there. Ooh, mysterious.” While there are plenty of actors who tend towards the insular, most are show‑offs it’s the nature of the job. Does she not jazz hands it up a bit at auditions? “Oh no,” she says, mock appalled. “I just can’t. I’ve always been very bad at networky events, at press nights and things. Everyone is buzzing with this meerkat energy” – she does a convincing impression of a meerkat, head bobbing up and down, left to right – “looking to see if there’s someone more famous over there.” As an only child, she’s happy being on her own, whether that’s at home under a blanket, or wandering through a party. Is she a shy person? “I definitely have a shy streak. I’m a very cautious person. I’ve realised that, as I’ve got older.”This caution has served her well at times. At the start of 2019, Atim was announced as one of the stars of Bloodmoon, the Game Of Thrones prequel written by Jane Goldman and starring Naomi Watts. That could have been life-changing, and she had to prepare herself accordingly. They shot a pilot, but it was revealed later in the year that it hadn’t gone ahead (another prequel, House Of The Dragon, written by Rampage writer Ryan Condal, was picked up instead). She seems sanguine about it. “When I found out, I had work coming up, so that helped soften the blow. As much as I wanted it to happen, I was also prepared for it not to it didn’t completely devastate me. You have to be ready for that kind of stuff.”Does this mean she’s making the big move to the US? Sort of, she says. She got a load of emails just today about various projects. “Some are in America and some are here, some are theatre, some are film, some are TV. I’ve always wanted to keep all those options open.”At school, she acted, sang and learned multiple musical instruments, but planned to be a doctor. She applied to medical school, but when she didn’t get a place, one of her teachers told her he thought it was a sign. “It was like a bubble popped over my head. I thought, ahh, I’m gonna be a performer.” She decided to be a singer, but still did a degree in biomedical sciences, because she loved the subject so much. “I’ve always written soul music, but I didn’t really know what my plan was. I liked to sing and accompany myself on the piano, and I’d loved Alicia Keys since I was a kid. Later on, I discovered Nina Simone.” While she was studying, she went to open-mic nights and tried to learn about the music industry. “I had this perception that I needed to write an EP, get four tracks down, work with a producer, get a rapper to do 16 bars,” she laughs. “Now I look back, I always felt like something wasn’t quite whole about that approach. People would say, ‘When’s your music coming out?’ And I’d be like, ‘Ah.’”She took a few music classes at WAC performing arts school in London, and ended up doing some drama there, too. Her path was set, though she didn’t yet know it. “When the acting took off, I was very resistant to the idea,” she says, smiling. Her drama teacher kept asking if she was going to drama school. “I said, ‘What are you talking about? No, come on. I’m gonna sing a couple of songs, get the rapper to do the 16 bars.’ But then everything started to expand.”Her first big stage role was in 2016, in Les Blancs at the National, though it was nonspeaking. “I just walked in slow motion! That got people’s attention, but, because I didn’t speak, I think I remained this, ‘Is she even real? Does she even exist?’ figure.” Later that year, she appeared in Phyllida Lloyd’s groundbreaking all-female Shakespeare Trilogy – Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest – set in a women’s prison. Then came Girl From The North Country and her first proper TV role, playing a Georgian prostitute called Limehouse Nell in the brilliantly scabrous Harlots. “It was cool, because it was a period drama. I thought, that’s probably the last genre I’m going to get into any time soon, and then here I was. But also I was performing Girl From The North Country at the same time, so that was a super-intense week.” Swinging between the two can’t have been easy. “That week was pretty dark, she laughs. “I was in Watford at 5am every day, filming, and then doing the show in the evening. Saturday came and I was just backstage, flat on my back, and somebody had to prod me with a stick to go on and say my lines.”Girl From The North Country was a gamechanger. Atim played the pregnant, unmarried teenager Marianne, and her haunting rendition of Dylan’s Tight Connection To My Heart (you can find it on YouTube) regularly moved audiences to tears. In fact, she had to watch herself singing recently because her agent wanted to put a clip of it in her showreel. “And I was really moved,” she says. You made yourself cry? She cracks up. “Yeah, I cried at myself and sat in front of my shrine. Popped a little screenshot of it on the shrine and poured some libations.” Seriously, she says, it’s more that people keep telling her how much it’s meant to them. “When I was shooting the Game of Thrones prequel in Belfast, one of the bar staff at the hotel said, ‘I never saw the show, but me and my mum love Bob Dylan and we put you on YouTube.’”Last year, Atim wrote her first play, Anguis, which debuted at the Edinburgh festival. “It was a massive, massive punt,” she says. “I didn’t think I’d ever write a play, ever.” She doubted that she could pull something out of her own imagination. “I thought, if a script exists, I can help as an actor – but I couldn’t just create something out of thin air: that’s insane. And then I had all these ideas I didn’t think I’d have.” She was interested in the myths around Cleopatra, whose achievements in science are rarely remembered, and made her into a character. Another character is a doctor, as Atim might have been. Once she got going, she found it hard to stop. “The director said, this is really interesting, but there’s so much of it. I was, like, I know. If you’d read previous drafts, it was just my mind going a mile a minute.”She’s currently redrafting Anguis, in the hope of putting it on elsewhere, and has a couple of other projects on the go. She doesn’t want to jinx them by talking about them, though she does say they bring music and theatre together in the way she’d always hoped she might. Is it the four-track EP with a rapper, at last? “OK, you got me. Finally! After six years, I’ve got round to it. It’ll be a fire EP and you’ll find me outside Camden station.”For a long time, Atim says, she felt as if she was getting away with something – as if, by being on stage at all, she’d somehow slipped through the net. “It was only when I picked up my MBE in December that I really had a moment of, oh, you’re probably meant to be here. For a long time, I had this rumbling imposter syndrome underneath.” On cue, a train goes above us, and the whole room rumbles. “Ominous,” she says, though it is anything but.• The Pale Horse begins on BBC One on 9 February.If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).

Dirty Records (Andra Långgatan 4) boasts a carefully collated selection of LPs ranging from funk to 1960s psychedelia – take time to mull over your purchase in their inhouse cafe. A few minutes west is Gothenburg’s biggest secondhand music shop, Andra Långgatans Skivhandel (no 33), where it’s worth setting aside some time to dig through endless shelves of records. There are rarities to be found, and patience will be rewarded.When it comes to entertainment, this part of Gothenburg brims with choice, boasting two of the city’s most-esteemed cultural venues. Housed inside an old cinema, Pustervik (Järntorgsgatan 12-14) has been entertaining locals since the early 1900s and is the place to go for live music plus a range of club nights. Folkteatern, on nearby Olof Palmes Plats, hosts high-quality theatre, film screenings, and other spoken-word and music performances.For something less highbrow but still highly satisfying, wander up Järntorgsgatan to Zamenhof (Esperantoplatsen 5), a huge space open from breakfast until late where the jewel in the crown is a vintage games room. Relive your childhood on its arcade and pinball machines, tackle giant Jenga, or take on some locals at table tennis.Eat and drinkFor a reasonably priced meal in a striking venue, visit Kafé Magasinet (Tredje Långgatan 9) in the neighbourhood’s former auction house. Sourdough pizzas are the speciality and a cosy, plant-filled terrace with a glass roof means you can feel as though you’re outdoors without being at the mercy of Gothenburg’s changeable weather.Next door, Tacos \u0026amp Tequila (Tredje Långgatan 9) is a hugely popular lunch and dinner spot, known particularly for its blackened salmon ceviche. Queuing for a table may be necessary but the no-reservations policy is a blessing: Swedes book tables weeks in advance if they’re given the chance.The Gothenburg beer scene has exploded in the past decade, so find out what all the fuss is about by rounding off the day at Soho Beer House (Andra Långgatan 5). This cosy but lively bar has a vast selection from the city’s micro-breweries and knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you pick. Dugges, a brewery at the vanguard of Gothenburg’s craft beer surge, is a must for beer fans.Where to stayYou won’t find a hotel in Långgatorna and that’s good: it keeps the authentic, local feeling alive, but a 20-minute walk or 10-minute tram journey links the neighbourhood with Gothenburg city centre. There, Avalon Hotel (doubles from £86 B\u0026ampB) vaunts its feng shui certification, and has stylish rooms plus a rooftop pool with a great view. Lee RodenThis part of Brussels, on the public transport network but pretty much off the tourist trail, has as many elderly residents as young professionals looking for bars and boutiques. You’re as likely to find yourself talking to a new arrival from Africa, opening his dream restaurant, as to a septuagenarian Belgian bar owner. In recent years, the student population – the city’s main French and Flemish universities are here – has attracted emerging talent and new investment. Until the end of 2020, the red-brick former army barracks immediately north of the Etterbeek train, tram and bus stops is home to the See U project full of sustainable small businesses, including Brussels’ first pushchair-friendly cafe, a cinema, a velodrome and a weekly organic market.See and doThe area is a paradise for entrepreneurs. Wine, spirits and cigar shop Boire et Fumer (Drink and Smoke) has been at 38 Avenue de l’Université for 57 years. Since 2005, it has been run by local Philippe Degand. At 62 rue des Hellènes, surveyor Jean-Baptiste Jonné retrained as a chocolate maker to open his first shop, L’Alchimie du Chocolat, in 2001. Ariane Noël, the manager of independent clothing boutique Cheep (110 Avenue des Saisons), says her clients range from young students to women in their 90s. Another female entrepreneur, Rachida Bouganzir, oversees the Haricot Magique cafe at See U, with a large indoor and outdoor site for parents and small children. After shopping and coffee, head to the Cimitière d’Ixelles to admire art nouveau tombstones at a site calling itself the Père Lachaise of Ixelles.Eat and drinkPlace de la Petite Suisse is the place to go for quality Asian food, with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants jostling for space. Bar Le Montmartre on the same square has been an institution for students, academics and couples looking for a quiet pastis or evening of live music since the 1960s, though beer fans also like Tavernier (445 Chaussée de Boondael). The pricey Caves d’Alex restaurant (14 rue Eugène Cattoir) moved last year from near the European Parliament to a spectacular former wine cellar. La Verveine (375 Avenue de la Couronne) serves French-Moroccan fusion food in a relaxed setting. Across the road at no 570 is Café Ricardo’s, serving excellent Portuguese food to a mostly Portuguese clientele.For sinfully good pastries, gluten-free bakery Chambelland opened its first branch outside Paris at 42 Avenue de l’Universite in 2018, while artisanal boulangerie La Fleur du Pain has just opened a new branch at 449 Chaussée de Boondael this year.Where to stayThe lack of tourists means there are no hotels in the quarter, but a short ride away on the number 8 tram is Avenue Louise and the Pantone Hotel (doubles from €59 room-only) where rooms are allocated based on the guest’s “mood and preferred colour”.Emily WaterfieldWhile the rest of Valencia was being treated to a Bilbaoesque makeover in the early 2000s, the rightwing city council of the time had it in for the fishing quarter of El Cabanyal, 5km east of the centre. It wanted to drive a swanky new avenue through the quaint streets, demolishing 1,600 houses, many of them decorated with original art nouveau tiles. It was classified a “listed area of cultural importance”, but the district was nonetheless threatened with compulsory purchase orders and destruction, until protests by local campaigners finally saw the scheme blocked by the courts. Over the past few years, El Cabanyal has been on the up, but this authentic slice of the city remains undiscovered by most tourists. While there’s a newly cosmopolitan vibe, the quarter’s traditional personality is being cherished by incomers, and the new shops and bars springing up everywhere tend to respect and adapt the vernacular architecture, rather than replace it. It’s a doddle to get here on the metro and, because it’s pancake-flat, it’s enjoyable to explore by bike. Hire one at Santamarcelita (Calle de la Reina 11) for €10 a day, or join a guided cycle tour with Poblados de la Mar (€25pp, in English on Mondays and Fridays at 10am), starting at bike shop Todobici on Calle Serrería.See and doFrom Las Arenas beach turn up Calle Mediterraneo, following the tram tracks – but keep an ear open as they move silently. Because of El Cabanyal’s grid layout, it’s difficult to get lost. The area is home to two excellent and under-visited museums: Museo Semana Santa Marinera (Calle del Rosari 1, closed Mon, free Sun), explains the rituals of Easter week and Museo del Arroz (Rosari 3, €2, closed Mon, free Sun), housed in an old rice mill, has the lowdown on the main ingredient of classic paella.Not all the tiled houses are in good repair – and all are private, so admire from the outside only. Examples to seek out are Calle Lluch 219 (the upper storey), Calle Progreso 262 and Calle Mediterraneo 37, which has a tiled mosaic showing oxen hauling a fishing boat out of the water at the top of its facade.El Drac del Cabanyal (Calle de la Reina 191B) sells traditional tiles and other handicrafts and, on the next street, Hilos, Cuerdas y Redes (Calle Lluch 159) is a traditional shop selling nautical rope and other boating accessories. Bookshop-cum-bar La Batisfera (Calle de la Reina 167) is a beautiful place to browse Spanish and English books, and the bar has good vegetarian options.Mercado del Cabanyal (every day except Sunday) is a mini-version of Valencia’s central market, selling local specialities such as horchata (a milk drink made from tiger nuts), while the Thursday Mercadillo street market on Calle Vilar sells mainly clothes and homewares.Eat and drinkThere are plenty of traditional spots in El Cabanyal: Casa Montaña (CJose Benillure 69) is a classic bar that has been going since 1836, where specialities include anchovies and mussels in various ways, but do try the baby broad beans sautéed with Iberian ham. The wine selection covers pretty much all of Spain. For authentic fishy cuisine (such as savoury cake made with squid ink and locally cultivated oysters) head to Taska Lareina (CReina 173) in a basement behind one of the Cabanyal’s best facades.For a straightforward, cheap meal try Bodega Bar Flor (CMarti Grajales 21) next to the market, which has been serving the locals since 1893 (rice dishes predominate: you can’t go wrong with paella but, for something different, try arròs amb fesol i naps – rice with white beans and turnip). Ca Tere (CReina 61), in another modernist building, also specialises in rice, but without so much choice.The best place for breakfast is Horno San Vicente (Progreso 148) which sells fresh ensaïmadas, soft coiled buns made with lard and dusted with sugar. The best horchata is from ice-cream specialist La Jijonenca (CPadre Luis Navarro 307, and Paseo Neptuno 26). For snacks, La Pascuala (CLluch 299) serves prodigiously large bocadillos.The hippest place for a drink is La Fabrica de Hielo, a huge bar in a former ice factory, one road back from the beach (CJose Ballaster Gonzalvo 37). It has a busy programme of live music and arts events and tapas supplied by a food caravan.Where to stayOn a palm-lined street in the middle of the district, Apartamentos Barracart (from €100 a night) has seven bright, large-windowed apartments. Hotel Neptuno (doubles from €75 B\u0026ampB) is a spacious option right on the beach. Further south, near the port, Balcon al Mar (doubles from €55 room-only) is a pleasant, inexpensive place, with bikes for guests to use. Nick Inman With city-centre rents skyrocketing, this once-bourgeois enclave is fast finding favour with a young, creative crowd. It is only a 20-minute walk from downtown and handy for primary exit route s: Porto’s main bus terminal and train station are on the doorstep and there’s a metro line to the airport.See and doThere are no malls in Bonfim, but plenty of cool independent stores, mostly on Rua de Santo Ildefonso. Keep an eye out for bookshop Inc. (no 25), a recent outpost of lifestyle outlet Patch (no 95), and the intimate emporium of cheeses and preserves that is Queijaria Amaral (no 190).Being home to Porto university’s fine arts faculty means Bonfim has always had an active arts scene. For contemporary art, the Senhora Presidenta (Joaquim António de Aguiar 65) and Lehmann + Silva (Duque da Terceira 179) galleries never disappoint. For fans of documentary photography, the recently launched Salut au Monde! (Santos Pousada, 620) is a must.For superb views over the Douro, stroll around the Parque de Nova Sintra (R. do Barão de Nova Sintra). Once private, this small leafy park is now owned by the water authority and has a wonderful collection of old fountains.Eat and drinkOne of the joys of Bonfim’s relative seclusion from Porto’s tourist boom is the plethora of old-school places to eat. For a classic neighbourhood dinner, try Madureira’s (Rodrigues de Freitas 1) for grilled tiger prawns or a francesinha (doorstep meaty sandwich). Local favourite Casa Aleixo (Estação 216) does a mean octopus with rice. Pulled-pork sandwiches at Casa Guedes (Praça dos Poveiros 130) are another local staple.Alongside these is a string of exceptional new eateries. Top of the list is Pedro Limão, on Bonfim’s western side, run by an architect-turned-chef serving fine dining at fair prices (10 courses €49) it recently added studio rooms upstairs. If meat-free is your bag, back towards the centre Árvore do Mundo (Duque de Loulé 228) and Manna (R. da Conceição 60) serve splendid veganveggie fare (Manna also does yoga classes).As for cafés and bars, there’s one on nearly every corner. Hip hangouts include speciality coffeehouse Combi (Morgado de Mateus 29) and brunch-lunch-coffee bar Bird of Passage (Duque de Loulé 185). For great cocktails (and pizza), head to TerraPlana (Av. Rodrigues de Freitas 287).Where to stayBonfim’s charm owes much to its elegant, early-20th-century townhouses. None is classier than myhomeinporto (from €200 for 2 nights), a boutique guesthouse run by former interior designer Juan de Mayoralgo. Similarly stylish is the 10-room, French-inspired Cocorico guesthouse (doubles from €90 room-only).Oliver BalchEven a decade or so ago, Neukölln, in south-east Berlin, was something of a backwater – a no-man’s-land beyond the trendy centre. Then the district’s cheap rents and gritty vibe were discovered by the international creatives and students, who moved in among the Turks, Kurds and Arabs to create today’s multikulti ambiance. Shack-like kebab shops and smart restaurants, shisha cafes and shabby-chic e bars, underground art galleries and commercial casinos sit side by side, and there is always something new to discover.Head to the main drag, Sonnennallee, for tasty, cheap Palestinian and Lebanese food stroll south-west to villagey Rixdorf, passing stone churches, cobbled streets and lovely Comenius botanical garden for late-night drinks, try hip Weserstrasse and for indulgent brunches and vintage browsing it’s hard to beat the area that overlaps with Kreuzberg (Kreuzkölln). The coolest area is probably dynamic, fast-changing Schillerkiez, next to Tempelhof park, site of the former city airport and Berlin airlift, which is now a vast recreation area where it’s possible to land-surf, cycle and rollerblade down the former runway.See and doGiven the creative influx and affordable rents, it’s no surprise to find a wealth of galleries and cultural spaces in the neighbourhood. These tend to be small and experimental like Loophole (Boddinstrasse 60), a club and music venue in a former brothel that also does site-specific works. The larger Kindl Centre for Contemporary Art (€5, under-18s free, Am Sudhaus 3) is in a former brewery and has installations and live performances.The district is well known for its vintage shopping and for stores that double as cafes. Sing Blackbird (Sanderstrasse 11) has shoes, jewellery and secondhand clothes, as well as juices, vegan pancakes and bagels. Rag and Bone Man (Briesestrasse 9) focuses on home decor and flowers, tipping into therapeutic services such as counselling. Shio (Weichselstrasse 59) works with local designers and stocks pretty and ethically minded papercraft, jewellery, clothes and home design objects. For food, the Turkish market by the Landwehr canal on Maybachufer has a great range of fresh produce and textiles every Tuesday and Friday.Eat and drinkFor something cheap, cheerful and filling, hole-in-the-wall Berlin Burger International (Pannierstrasse 5) has specialities such as the Godmother, with mozzarella and serrano ham, plus killer sweet potato wedges. Vietnamese joint Hamy (Hasenheide 10) also offers delicious daily lunch specials for just €5, while vegans will enjoy Two Planets (Hermannstrasse 230), whose offerings include a famous sourdough bread with avocado, delicious cakes and great salads. Swisher options include Lavanderia Vecchia (Flughafenstrasse 46), which serves rustic trattoria food in a former launderette, and chic new dessert restaurant Coda (Friedelstrasse 47), which has won a Michelin star for its innovative menu of savoury, as well as sweet, concoctions. The full set menu costs €138 a head but come after dinner and sit at the bar for a cocktail and à la carte option.For post-dinner drinks, there are a dozen great bars on Weserstrasse alone, from the grungy, arty Ä (no 40), with its flea market furnishings and foamy draft beers, to swankier cocktail bar TiER (no 42) just up the street. In summer, head to Klunkerkranich (Karl-Marx-Strasse 66), hidden away on the rooftop of a shopping mall, with a laid-back DIY aesthetic, decent DJs and views over the city. If you want to take things up a notch, Sameheads and Griessmühle will take you through to the next day, sometimes even longer.Where to stayThere aren’t many hotels here, but the Hüttenpalast (from €70 a night) is quintessential Berlin with its self-builtdecorated caravans and huts inside a former factory. Paul SullivanThe Powiśle district’s main boulevard on the left bank of the Vistula was once the preserve of dodgy bikers and lonely fishermen. Thanks to Poland’s economic boom it now resembles a carnival every summer, when the temperature usually tops 30C. Time to abandon preconceptions that Warsaw is grey and cold because in the best part of the year it really is green and hot. Pubs and riverboats offer craft beers and cocktails, with street food ranging from pierogi dumplings to pho soup (Warsaw has a big Vietnamese community). Powiśle was on the frontline in the Warsaw uprising against Nazi Germany and wears its shrapnel scars with pride. It’s fitting that the district is now all about people having cycling, roller-blading, volleyball, trampolining, picnics, people deckchairs, ice-cream, live music, dancing and playing in the sandfun. See and doIn the summer, the best way to approach Powiśle is by the free, seasonal tramwaje wodne (water trams) that ferry people to and from the wild beaches on the opposite bank of the river, or with a Veturilo city bike (March-November only) – your first 20 minutes is free. The major Powiśle landmark is Warsaw University Library (open to the public as well as students), which has an impressive facade of copper panels with texts in Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Old Russian and Old Polish. Its roof garden has a spectacular view. The adjacent Copernicus Science Centre is ideal for children, who can spend hours at the interactive displays. For shopping, Femi Stories (Browarna 4) has women’s and girls’ clothing from independent makers. Poland is one of the biggest producers of furniture in the world, and while buying chairs is rarely an option for holidaymakers, Moma Studio (Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie 45) also has unusual home- and kitchenwares. Down towards the Świętokrzyski bridge, Elektrownia (Zajęcza 2b), a former power station, is gradually filling with high-end shops and restaurants – worth a visit for the early 20th-century industrial architecture.Eat and drinkElektrownia’s fine-dining restaurant is Niewinni Czarodzieje 2.0, where options include beef carpaccio with truffles. Warsaw is one of the world’s top vegan-friendly cities, and Powiśle’s established contribution is Veg Deli (Radna 14), with pumpkin burgers and spinach and “feta” ravioli. Also worth exploring are the seasonal barges and street food stalls by the river, which change every year.Where to stayAt Powiśle’s southern edge, Inbed Hostel (dorm bed from £9, en suite double £26 B\u0026ampB) has bright, modern rooms close to the underground. By the riverside park is the mid-range Logos (doubles £45 room-only). A luxury option is Robert De Niro’s Nobu at the Rialto (prices tba), opening in the city centre this spring.Keith LockramNorth of central Prague, on the Vltava’s left bank beyond Letná park, Holešovice was for a long time seen as a bleak district with little to offer locals, let alone visitors. Its impressive resurgence over the past decade or so has been largely thanks to creative and commercial entrepreneurs taking advantage of low rents and empty spaces – apartment blocks, factories – to create a vibrant infrastructure of galleries, shops, cafes, clubs and bars. Although not as postcard-pretty as Stare Mesto (the old town) or Mala Strana over the river, Holešovice’s blend of industrial buildings, 19th- and early 20th-century tenements (with some lovely art nouveau blocks) and occasional communist behemoths makes for interesting meanders, and there are cultural treats aplenty too.See and doHolešovice is home to big hitters such as the sprawling, plane-train-and-automobile-filled National Technical Museum (Kostelní 42), and the Veletrzni Palace (Dukelských hrdinů 47), part of the city’s National Gallery, but there’s plenty of contemporary art on offer too. The Dox Centre for Contemporary Art (Poupětova 1) helped put the district on the map when it opened in 2008, and runs consistently great exhibitions inside a former factory complex. At the revitalised Prague Market (on Bubenské embankment), a former slaughterhouse now houses international theatre and circus space Jatka 78 and the Trafo Gallery. Other hotspots include the Chemistry Gallery near the Hlávkův bridge, cultural centre La Fabrika (32 Komunardů) for theatre and concerts, and the highly popular Bio Oko independent cinema on Františka Křížka street, which hosts events and festivals. For a splash of green, Letná park’s hilltop location offers fine views across the city as well as beer gardens and, a few minutes’ walk north, Stromovka, the former royal game reserve, is the city’s largest green space.Small but vibrant Veverkova street has become a mini-hub for shoppers, thanks to several retail hotspots in close proximity. Right by Bistro 8 (see below) is Garage Store (no 6), for sneakers and vinyl, and fashion store Jakoby (no 8), for unisex coats, dresses and jumpers, plus vintage outlet Recycle With Love. Right across the road (no 7) is the shop of designer Helena Darbujanova, who sells her own chairs, tables and lamps alongside work of other Czech designers, and Page Five (no 5) which stocks an international array of books, magazines, and posters, and also hosts launches and events. Another great event to look out for is the pop-up Mint Market, which brings together Czech interior, fashion and jewellery designers in Prague Market and other venues.Eat and drinkThe range of dining and drinking options here is healthy and growing all the time. There’s a choice of hip breakfast and brunch hangouts, from Cafe Letka (Letohradská 44) with its rough walls and handsomely large windows, to the spacious industrial chic of Vnitroblock (Tusarova 31), which doubles as a gallery and concept store. For tasty Czech pastries and cakes, head to the simple Erhart patisserie (Milady Horáková 56). The stylish Bistro Jankovcova (Jankovcova 14a) has sweet or savoury breakfasts, soups and salads, and Bistro 8 (Veverkova 14108) serves Sunday brunches, brisket burgers and pulled pork tacos. For dinner, check out swanky SaSaZu in Prague Market, which matches Asian fusion cuisine to regular DJ sets, or Bar Cobra (M Horáková 8), whose menu s mezze plates, wild boar with noodles, and a great selection of wines and cocktails. If you still have energy to hit the dancefloor, grungy Cross Club (Plynární 23) has live shows, DJ nights and themed parties pretty much every night, while the slicker Mecca (U Průhonu 3) is the spot for house music all night long.The Ostiense neighbourhood, right on the Tiber river, was once the site of a power station, a restless river port and a gasometer, whose skeleton still looms. It’s named after Via Ostiensis, an arterial road that ran in ancient times from the city’s cattle market to the port town of Ostia. Today, Ostiense has shaken off its industrial past to become a bastion of new restaurants, street art and bars. A scattering of campuses mean there’s a big student population, but there’s also an international crowd, drawn by reasonable rents and a metro link to the city centre. Come here to eat sumptuously and admire historic sites far from the masses.See and doOne of the city’s four major basilicas, St Paul’s Outside the Walls on Piazzale San Paolo 1 enjoys a quiet stream of visitors, a far cry from its more famous counterpart, St Peter’s. While it suffered a fire in the 19th century and underwent lengthy repairs, its ancient mosaics and 13th-century cloister were spared. The latter serves as a lovely spot to unwind after a day’s sightseeing. Further down Via Ostiense lies Centrale Montemartini, arguably Rome’s most underrated museum. Originally an electricity plant, the space was abandoned until 2005 when it was chosen to house artwork from the overcrowded Capitoline Museums. Seek out its delightfully jarring juxtaposition of delicate classical statues and defunct diesel engines and turbines. Head north towards Trastevere and the city centre (keeping an eye out for vibrant street art) and have a look round the Non-Catholic Cemetery, the final resting place of Romantic poets and former Rome residents John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Via Caio Cestio 12). The ancient pyramid of Caius Cestius, constructed in about 12BC, keeps a staid watch over the cemetery. Visitors are allowed inside the pyramid on a guided tour the third and fourth Saturday and Sunday of every month (entrance on Via Raffaele Persichetti).Shops aren’t Ostiense’s forte, but cheese, olive oil, pasta, wine and other edible souvenirs can be purchased from gastronomic megastore Eataly, on the south side of Ostiense train station. Beyond the basilica, zero-waste shop Negozio Leggero sells anything from beauty products to chocolate to spices, all packaging-free (Via Chiabrera 80).Food and drinkLocals and expats flock to restaurant and micro-bakery Marigold (Via Giovanni da Empoli 37), run by Sophie, who’s from Denmark, and her Calabrese partner Domenico, for its cosy atmosphere and homely dishes. Instead of the traditional Italian breakfast of caffè and cornetto (croissant), they serve dishes like eggs benedict, pancakes or fluffy cheese omelettes. At lunch and dinner there will be handmade pasta and plenty of vegetable-lush dishes too.Doted on by critics – it even made the Michelin Guide’s coveted Bib Gourmand list this year – Trattoria Pennestri (Via Giovanni da Empoli 5) flirts with both traditional Roman and gourmet cuisine. Tuck into a glossy plate of carbonara, or mains such as roasted octopus with peppers, mint and yogurt and suckling pig with porcini mushrooms and myrtle. There’s no chance you’ll wangle a table without booking.Staunch titans of cucina romana such as tripe, cacio e pepe, and salt cod anchor the kitchen of Osteria Fratelli Mori near the cemetery (Via dei Conciatori 10). It’s also one of the rare Rome restaurants that can easily accommodate a large group. Once the sun goes down, head to Caffè Letterario (Via Ostiense 95), a cafe, bookshop and cultural space that moonlights as a cocktail bar. In hot weather, sip a glass of red on the terrace at T-Bar (Via Ostiense 182) or in the Instagrammable courtyard of Porto Fluviale (Via del Porto Fluviale 22). For late-night munchies, chocolate-chip-studded sweet buns from Il Pangocciolaio (Via dei Magazzini Generali 15) hit the spot.Where to stayGasometer Urban Suites (studio with kitchenette from €86) is a former wool processing plant turned hotel with a gym and roof terrace.Alexandra BruzzeseIn between the touristy Skadarlija quarter, the huge Kalemegdan fortress and banks of the Danube, Dorćol has a comfortable air about it that doesn’t immediately scream cool. But it has always been the pace-setter for the city’s bars and restaurants. The tree-lined streets of its southern part – Gornji (Upper) Dorćol – have the usual Belgrade hotchpotch of early 20th-century villas and Tito-era flats, with the occasional art nouveau beauty. This is classic bar territory, with new openings and old favourites alike squeezed into streets such as Strahinjića Bana, Kneginje Ljubice and Kralja Petra.But head into Dornji (Lower) Dorćol towards the Danube and things get grittier, with funky little cafes, craft breweries, arts centres and street art taking over rundown industrial buildings. It’s not pretty, but it’s where things are moving along briskly.See and doDorćol Platz (Dobračina 59) in Dornji Dorćol is a collection of old industrial buildings that have been transformed into a nicely scruffy cultural centre with a cafe and garden. It hosts everything from gigs and vinyl markets to festivals, including the Mikser Festival of Design, held each May. From here it’s a few minutes’ walk to the Museum of Science and Technology (Skenderbegova 51), whose exhibits trace the story of technology in Serbia in an entertaining way. Fans of vintage gear should check out Jane Doe Vintage Shop (Kapetan Mišina 17) and its larger concept store and bar (Gospodar Jevremova 25). Dorćol isn’t particularly awash with green spaces, but it does have a lovely, wide cycle and footpath along the Danube, and past Novak Djokovic’s Novak Tennis Centre.Eat and drinkThe choice of bars and restaurants in Dorćol is quite dizzying. There are traditional and long-established favourites on leafy Strahinjića Bana but a short walk to the south, Blaznavac (Kneginje Ljubice 18) serves £4 cocktails and £1.50 pints of beer in a fantastically bonkers garden and equally eccentric interior. It’s just a few feet from Iris New Balkan Cuisine (Kneginje Ljubice 11), which does more elegant versions of hefty Serbian dishes, including pork neck (£7).The craze for craft beer hasn’t passed Belgrade by: there are several brewpubs around Dorćol. Gvint Brewery in Dorćol Platz is a genial place to try lagers and ales for about £1.50 a pint. At Beogradski Market (Žorža Klemansoa 19), craft breweries such as Dogma and Tron share the vast hangar-like space with food stalls selling anything from tapas to sushi.In the midst of Dornji Dorćol’s street art and ramshackle former workshops, fine-dining restaurant Homa (Senjanina Ive) stands out with its gleaming white minimalism. Plates of poached trout with trout roe (£14) and steak tartare with bone marrow (£12) are pricey by local standards, but worth it.Where to stayFifties decor meets industrial chic in Smokvica B\u0026ampB (doubles from €65), with six airy rooms in a 1929 villa in Upper Dorćol. Its lively bar and restaurant spills into a courtyard garden. Mary NovakovichThe 20th arrondissement, in eastern Paris, is well-known for the place where Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf are buried, but a short walk away, hidden from the crowds, is a genuine village, Charonne, little known to tourists. Circular Place de la Réunion, laid out in 1850, is the heart of this friendly, bohemian quartier populaire, a multicultural area of working families, artists and musicians. The square comes alive on Thursday and Sunday mornings, when it teems with people browsing market stalls set up by butchers, cheese- and fishmongers, and fruit and vegetable sellers.But there is another hub here that is open every day, from 7am to 2am. Café Sans Nom, on the corner of rue de la Réunion, does not need a name (or a website) as it is more a community centre for everyone living in or passing by the square, from school-run mums or pensioners sipping a coffee while reading newspapers and books from the cafe’s free library, to the crowd who arrive for drinks after midnight.See and doYou won’t find chic boutiques in this neighbourhood, but rather quirky, ethical shops such as L’Escargot d’Or (53 rue de Bagnolet) where Gilles Coolen roasts fairtrade coffee beans and makes delicious artisan chocolate. On the other side of the street (no 52), Agnès Baracco stocks Au Bon Vingt, her pioneering natural wine cellar, with over 400 varieties, which she loves explaining to visitors. At no 69, La Botica (no 69) is a new shop and gallery showcasing young artists, designers and stylists, with changing themes that cover photography and illustration, jewellery and vintage clothes, prints and ceramics.Eat and drinkEveryone’s favourite Sunday begins at 6pm in the funky Quartier Rouge bistro (52 rue de Bagnolet), which hosts a weekly three-hour jazz jam session. Entry is free and a glass of wine is €3.50, but be sure to contribute when the musicians’ hat is passed round. It also serves tasty no-frills French cuisine, but for a bit more choice, take a five-minute walk to romantic rue des Vignoles, which is lined with laid-back bars and restaurants. La Petite Fabrique (no 15) is a spacious bio-canteen offering a perfect combination of organic cuisine (maybe vegetarian paella, juicy beef tournedos or a vegan sweet potato gratin with seitan sausages) and natural wines, served at long communal tables.Almost next door, Les Mondes Bohèmes (no 31) is a popular hangout whose verdant covered terrace resembles a greenhouse it’s great for salads, burgers and ice-cream.Wander down some of the narrow plant-lined alleyways (impasses) off rue des Vignoles – perhaps the evocative Impasse Satan or bucolic Impasse Poule – and imagine the time when this was all vineyards, la campagne à Paris. For a last drink, finish up at the arty Moki Bar (no 61), enjoying its kitsch 1970s decor and pinball machines, exhibitions, funky music and great mojitos.Where to stayRecently renovated Hôtel Terre Neuve (doubles from €99 room-only) is five minutes’ walk from Place de la Réunion, but the fashion-minded may prefer the Philip Starck-designed Mama Shelter (doubles from €139 room only), the first of this now-global hip hotel chain.John BruntonLooking for a holiday with a difference?

But now I’m no longer a citizen …London in the 1950s and 60s was an ebullient, technicolour time. But it was also an era during which most of monochrome Britain regarded “the Continent” as a place of “rabies and intellectuals” – as New York Times journalist Roger Cohen, raised in north London, put it in a book about his mother.I didn’t care about rabies, and wanted to meet and emulate the intellectuals. When I was in my mid-teens, fuelled by the uprisings of 1968 in Paris and Prague, the world – my life – began when the ferry pulled out of Dover. Clutching my blue SNCF rail ticket, watching the cliffs recede with a sense of liberation, across the choppy Channel to dock in Calais, transferring to the Paris train, traversing the capital to Gare de Lyon and boarding an overnight iron horse to points south. Destinations: Provence, or Italy, or Austria, or the then-turbulent Basque Country and Spain.I was in a dotty band then, and wrote a silly rocker entitled Down to ’Spaña which opened: “Were you ever on that night trainLeaving Paris in the pouring rain?To greet the light of Dordogne dawn-breakC’mon move now, huhDown to ’Spaña.”I relished those journeys, staring out at sulphur-yellow lamps illuminating stations and goods yards. As a (much better) John Cale song puts it: “Looking out from hereAt half past France.” You’d hand your passport to Italian customs at Chiasso on the Swiss border – this no longer happens, of course – then head across the Po valley, through cypress-strewn hills in Tuscany and Lazio and on to Rome, exhausted, happy, blinded by the light.Come the 1970s, most of my generation saw Europe on an Interrail pass, which afforded unlimited travel for a month. But I travelled à la carte, loth to hurry around. I didn’t want to leave a place until I’d come to know it a bit, established myself with the clientele of a bar on some cobbled square, fully explored the museums and backstreets, perhaps even caught a football match.Apart from one summer in Chicago, this was how I spent every Easter and summer holiday, and every penny earned – to change into lire, francs, schillings or pesetas. Then came the moment to cast my first vote in 1975: over whether Britain should remain a member of the then European Economic Community. I had finally come “home” – and a decade or so later, I would have the words “European Community” on my passport.I had worked hard on French at school, and took Italian lessons in the evenings, aware that I needed a toolkit of vocabulary and grammar. It’s one thing to take a taxi from Seville’s Santa Justa station and rely on the driver’s pidgin English it’s quite another – and works out cheaper – to ask whether he is a palangana (supporter of Sevilla FC) or a bético (fan of rivals Real Betis, after the Roman name for the city’s Guadalquivir river) and why.I wore Kickers shoes, even though I disliked them, because they were originally made in France and looked ‘“continental”. In the mid-70s I bought my first car – a Citröen 2CV – in Brussels, so that the steering wheel would be on the “wrong” side in Britain. Two Renault 5s followed in the same vein – it was 20 years before I bought a car with a steering wheel on the British “right” side (a sturdy Volvo, still on the road, from the then editor of this newspaper).I didn’t want to be a tourist I wanted to be a European. A true “cosmopolitan”, as envisaged by Diogenes, who coined the term. For me, to be European is existential. It’s about who and what we are. It defines a way of being, sans frontières, a state of curiosity about the way other people live and a burning need to partake in it, speak their tongues and understand not just their cultures but their quotidian modus vivendi: beliefs, music, football, food, firewater and wine.Of course, I arrived in the Americas and elsewhere, but that belonging was never on offer. Being European was, and I duly took my citizenship not from Britannia, but from the Phoenician princess, mother of King Minos of Crete – Europa – and the words “European Union” on my passport.I’ve travelled the far corners of Europe, and occasionally lived between them: from County Mayo’s wild seaboard, to fishing villages along the Black Sea shore and Danube delta, and the rocks of Ikaria island in the south-east (though I don’t claim to speak Romanian or Greek). From midnight sun and midday darkness in the Nordic north to the passeggiata beneath Mount Etna in Catania, Sicily, and the docks of Tarifa in Andalucia, from which a good outfielder could attempt a throw into Africa.We had wonderful but purposeful, busy and focused family holidays across Italy and France, scouring minor museums in small towns. In between were picnics with wine – my mother sketching people in cafes, my father etching church architecture. I got my first-ever job at the Vienna Staatsoper in January 1973 and enrolled at the University of Florence later that year. When friends hit the hippie trail east, I stayed in Italy, preferring to investigate Bologna and Milan. Except for exploring the Americas, I returned scores of times, mainly to Italy, France and Belgium and the Netherlands. I had a Swedish life for a while, for failed romantic reasons.I travelled not to “holiday”, but to conjoin European life I read newspapers, not guide books. I wanted no part in the fantasies of Brits in Tuscany or Provence I travelled for work, for pleasure, for language, art and football, for the musky scent of old stone, light and landscape, love and love’s wreckage – out of deferential but insatiable curiosity, to listen and learn. If a holiday, or money, ran out halfway along a valley, I’d endeavour to return to the same place, and carry on up or downriver.In 1990, my dream came true, and I was posted to Rome by this newspaper. I didn’t deliberately shun expats and the international press I just preferred to hang out with Italian colleagues, friends, rogues and neighbours, watching AS Roma, Juventus and SSC Napoli, where I had a season ticket.By then something remarkable had happened to Europe. Back in 1981, my work had taken me to Poland, and early cracks in the communist edifice, following the 1980 strike at the Gdansk shipyard. Then, in 1989, I had found myself reporting from Berlin and Bucharest as Stalin’s walls crumbled.The dream that Europe’s reunification could be peaceful twisted into nightmare across former Yugoslavia, but there was this: how would one have replied to a whisper on the wind through the Croatian town of Vukovar, as I reported it being levelled into the dust of its own stone by Serbian artillery in 1991, predicting that within 30 years, this place would be in the EU, and London out?On Mayday 2004, I was in Warsaw with friends from Gdansk days celebrating Poland’s accession to the EU – an affirmation as important to them as being part of the union was to me. Later that night, I was with a “Polish noise” band shattering rusty ironwork in a disused factory – and so began a relationship with that country too.The closest rapport, though, is genetic, and part of my life since I wrote a university thesis on the Irish Troubles in 1974, more interested in Belfast and Derry than any dreaming spires of Oxford. My bond to Ireland was bequeathed by two Irish grandmothers. Ireland is now Europe’s most interestingly changed country – in large part because of the EU – and one of its youngest, demographically. For decades, people like the great writer Edna O’Brien left what they saw as the myopic and inward-looking green-letterbox island off the coast of Britain for the breezy cosmopolitanism of red-letterbox-land. Now the roles are reversed – inward-looking England and Wales off the coast of international Ireland.Where did all this lead “my” Europe? The continent became an entity and identity, not necessarily in people’s self-perception, but in living-breathing reality. Some 400 million people cross 26 countries without having to show their passport, under the Schengen treaty. There are now 2 million “Erasmus babies” born to students from all over Europe, under the inspired 1987 scheme whereby any student in the EU can study and settle in any of 28 countries – now 27. How marvellous is that?Millions of people whizz, work and abide across a continent not without its problems, but without internal seams. And remember: they are the grand- and great-grand children of those who endured slaughter in the first world war. Children and grandchildren of a Europe ravaged by Holocaust and the second world war. Children of the cold war and Berlin Wall. Have the Italians, Dutch, French, Romanians, Latvians and Portuguese lost their identity to this process? No, they’re just part of it. Nor did the British, and we were part of that too but now we’re not. I was all my adult life, and now I’m not. In 2008, I submitted an article to the Observer on the slipstream of England’s failure to qualify for the 2008 Euros (played in Austria and Switzerland), arguing that this was a metaphor for what Europe would look like without Britain – calmer actually, without England’s awful fans.Fair Europa, fare thee well – and thou shalt, without us.

Shh, don’t ask too loudly: Kevin McCloud is just over there, blazer over a sweater, flicking his head up at some panelling, inspecting your brickwork, fingers in your bank account, puzzling over how you went over budget. Did you invite Kevin McCloud in? Because I didn’t invite Kevin McCloud in, but Kevin McCloud is in. He’s like an architectural vampire: he cannot set foot into your house unless you give him explicit permission, can’t cross the threshold of the area you’ve taped out for windows unless you tell him he can do so. And yet here he is, in the corner of your comprehension, peering, McClouding, getting your wife pregnant without you noticing.This is the recurring theme of Kevin McCloud’s Rough Guide to the Future (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4): Kevin McCloud is in it, but he does not need to be in it. “We drive too much, fly far too much, eat too much, and shop insatiably,” Kevin McCloud says, bombasting in front of some green screen. Is Kevin McCloud going to solve the future? Is technology the answer to the planet’s ills? The icebergs are melting, and I’m excited to find out what Kevin McCloud is going to do about it. And then: oh, right. It’s a travelogue.So here’s the set-up: Kevin McCloud thinks technology can repair the planet, and he keeps saying so, alone in an eerie white studio, without ever really following up on that. And then Kevin McCloud goes away, and in his place Alice Levine and Jon Richardson and Phil Wang get on planes (dunno if you remember 100 words ago, when Kevin McCloud explicitly told us off for this) and go to Japan and America and China, and all peer at technology, wholly McCloudless.“These cynics don’t believe me,” Kevin says, trapped in his studio prison, and then we watch as it starts off quite worthy (Phil Wang learns about insect farming Jon Richardson consumes a synthetic chicken nugget nobody seems particularly cynical) and then almost immediately veers into the same tired old don’t-other-cultures-do-things-a-bit-funny stuff. Jon Richardson’s car makes a fart sound and Alice Levine politely meets a man who is married to a robot. At the start of the show you expect Kevin McCloud to solve world hunger, and by the end of it you’re just watching the cardigan lad from 8 Out of 10 Cats get served coffee by a robot arm. I don’t know what this is in aid of.Well, I do: it’s in aid of Vodafone 5G. Rough Guide to the Future is one of those corporate-sponsorship-in-the-shape-of-harmless-evening-TV mash-up events, where normal programming keeps looping back to mention the same brand name that lights up the advert pre-rolls. So 5G, we are told, will soon power driverless cars, allow workers to control robots from home, and offer various other advances that are not remotely related to “saving the environment”, and Vodafone is at the forefront of it. Essentially: Vodafone sent Phil Wang to China to eat a battered spider, and now we all have to get phone upgrades. Here, enjoy your TV show about the future. We’ll either marry robots or be dead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e7923dc98c90079bccefc1c8b5e664b548aad7/0_117_5472_3282/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aad9a45ff5b75f2f4a5b908e4bab7a8","title":"bernie sanders pete buttigieg debate new hampshire iowa latest","story":"Competing visions for the party were on display as moderate candidates challenged progressives ahead of New Hampshire primaryDemocratic presidential candidates clashed on Friday night in a tense televised debate that was dominated by attacks against Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, the two candidates who declared victory after the Iowa caucuses.In the week that Donald Trump was acquitted in his impeachment trial and days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, the competing visions for the Democratic party were on show as moderate candidates challenged the progressives, and those with more Washington experience called out the relative political newcomers.Sanders fielded criticism from his fellow candidates over his support for his Medicare for All universal healthcare proposal, a government-run health insurance plan favored by progressives that would revolutionize the US system, while Buttigieg was forced to fend off criticism over his youth and inexperience.“How much is it going to cost? Who’s going to pay for it?” former vice-president Joe Biden asked Sanders while contrasting his own healthcare plan with the Vermont senators’.The Friday night debate was a key test for Biden, who has long been regarded as the undeniable frontrunner in the Democratic primary race. But he appeared to have placed fourth in the Iowa contest, far behind Sanders, Buttigieg and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.Opening the debate, Biden acknowledged he “took a hit” in Iowa, and he predicted that he would “probably take a hit” in New Hampshire too, casting himself as an underdog in the Granite state considering Sanders’ strong finish there in 2016.But Biden warned that Sanders represented a risk because of his self-description as a “Democratic socialist,” and that Buttigieg has not proved he has the experience to be president.Biden’s longterm prospects appear to increasingly depend on how he performs in the South Carolina primary on 29 February, where he polls very favorably among the state’s large Democratic African American population.The debate discussion moved to race and South Carolina, as billionaire activist Tom Steyer went on the offensive against Biden by highlighting controversial comments from one of his surrogates in an apparent bid to challenge him for that support. Buttigieg, who has struggled to appeal to non-white voters, repeatedly deflected a question about the rate of arrests of African Americans increasing while he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Moderator Linsey Davis asked Warren if Buttigieg’s answer was sufficient. “No,” Warren replied, in one of very few standout moments of the night, prompting applause. “We cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race,” she added.Ahead of the New Hampshire primary vote, there is still no clear frontrunner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee who will take on Donald Trump in November’s election, though recent polling has shown both Sanders and Buttigieg leading.Seven of the 11 remaining leading candidates took to the stage on Friday night Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren and Biden, as well as the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, Steyer and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.Klobuchar, a moderate who has been trailing the others but enjoyed several strong moments on the debate stage on Friday, presented herself as the person to challenge Trump and work across the aisle, warning that Sanders’ healthcare proposal isn’t supported by “two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate” and that it would “kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years”.When the debate veered toward a discussion on experience, 38-year-old Buttigieg – a former mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan – contrasted himself with Biden, Klobuchar and Sanders, saying he represented experience outside of Washington. But Klobuchar, 59, shot back that “we have a newcomer in the White House, look where it got us”.She also called out Buttigieg for saying he had found watching the impeachment trial “exhausting” (as senators, Klobuchar, Warren, Sanders, and longshot candidate Michael Bennet had all been in Washington to attend instead of campaigning in Iowa).At another point during the debate, Buttigieg took a veiled swipe at Biden and his “politics of the past”.Biden responded by touting his work in the Obama administration: “I don’t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.”Meanwhile, Warren struggled to cut through, speaking far less than in previous debates. Speaking afterwards, she told MSNBC: “I just didn’t say enough, didn’t fight hard enough, didn’t tell you how bad I want this and how good we can make it if we just come together.”It’s unclear how much impact a messy debate on a Friday will have among New Hampshire voters.“There are a lot of New Hampshire voters who are still undecided so the debate gives voters an opportunity for a check on some – not all – of the candidates and an opportunity to help make up their mind,” said the former New Hampshire Democratic party chair Kathy Sullivan. But Sullivan also warned that this close to an election, a mistake during the debate “could be a problem”.Ahead of the debate Sanders strongly signalled that he planned to direct his attacks at Buttigieg. Earlier in the day the Sanders campaign sent out a fundraising email titled “Billionaires ❤️ Pete Buttigieg.”After the New Hampshire primary, the next televised debate will be held in Las Vegas on 19 February, a few days ahead of the Nevada caucuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac68ccf45dc541ca419f88971bb9aafb9ddea797/0_175_3688_2213/master/3688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a74e37877a04f7fef311785c17b662b7","title":"chuck sims africa move 9 freed philadelphia","story":"One of the great open wounds of the black liberation struggle of the 1970s has finally been healed with the release of the last member of the Move 9, the group of radicals rounded up in a Philadelphia police siege in 1978 and held behind bars for more than four decades.Chuck Sims Africa, 59, walked free from the Fayette state correctional institution in La Belle, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning. The youngest of the incarcerated group, he has been in custody since shortly after he turned 18.His freedom marked his reunion with his family for the first time in almost 42 years. It was also historic, as it closed a chapter that had remained unfinished since the black power movement erupted in the late 1960s.Alongside the Black Panthers, Philadelphia’s Move organisation was central to the volatile and at times violent struggle for black equality that lasted until the 1980s.Members of the organisation regarded themselves – and still do to this day – as part of a family dedicated to race equality, with all members taking the last name “Africa”. Part Panthers and part eco-hippies, they also had a commitment to environmental justice that was ahead of its time.Mike Africa Jr, the son of two of the Move 9, said Chuck’s release put an end to a long and gruelling campaign. “We will never have to shout ‘Free the Move 9!’ ever again. It’s been 41 years, and now we’ll never have to say it.”For Mike Africa, who is also Chuck’s nephew, the release was especially poignant. He was born in a cell five weeks after his mother, Debbie Sims Africa, Chuck’s sister, was rounded up in the 1978 siege and incarcerated – she gave birth to him unbeknown to the prison guards and kept him hidden with her in the cell for the first few days of his life. began investigating the prolonged imprisonment of the Move 9 in 2018 as part of an examination into black power behind bars. At that time all the surviving members of the group were still in custody in various Pennsylvania prisons.Members of the group described in letters, emails and prison interviews how they had endured so many years inside while keeping their spirits high. Janine Phillips Africa said that she raised therapy dogs in her cell and grew vegetables in the prison yard, avoiding birthdays or holidays that reminded her of the passage of time.“The years are not my focus,” she wrote in a letter to the . “I keep my mind on my health and the things I need to do day by day.”Delbert Orr Africa said: “We’ve suffered the worst that this system can throw at us – decades of imprisonment, loss of loved ones. So we know we are strong.”Soon after the  began its investigation, the seven surviving members of the group began to be released on parole. First up was Debbie Sims Africa, set free in June 2018. “We are peaceful people,” she said as she stepped out of Cambridge Springs prison.Then the other six began to emerge, one after the other like falling dominoes:* Janine Phillips Africa and Janet Holloway Africa, May 2019Chuck Sims Africa completes the set.The Move 9 were arrested following a massive police siege of their collective headquarters and home in Powelton Village, Philadelphia, on 8 August 1978. Hundreds of police officers in Swat teams armed with machine guns, teargas, bulldozers and water cannons surrounded the property following a long standoff with city authorities that saw the group as a threat to the community.The siege culminated in a police shootout in which Move members allegedly returned fire though they denied doing so. A police officer, James Ramp, was killed in the crossfire.Nine members were arrested and held jointly responsible for Ramp’s death despite forensic evidence showing he was killed with a single bullet. In 1980 the nine were convicted of third-degree murder and lesser offenses and each sentenced to 30 years to life.Two of the nine – Merle and Phil Africa – died in prison. The remaining seven fought for many years to convince parole authorities that they were safe to be let out, pointing to clean discipline sheets in prison.Over the past two years there have been no security incidents relating to any of the paroled iniduals.Wilson Goode, former mayor of Philadelphia, wrote to the parole board to support Chuck Africa’s bid for freedom. He said: “His release will reunite a family after 40 years and I am convinced he will be a positive contributing voice to the Philadelphia community.”Goode, the first black mayor of Philadelphia, was in that position on 13 May 1985 when the second disaster relating to Move occurred. Following another prolonged bout of acrimony between the organisation and its neighbors and city authorities, the decision was taken forcibly to evict the group from its latest headquarters, then in Osage Avenue.Another shootout broke out, and when that failed to flush them out police dropped incendiary bombs from a helicopter on to the roof of the building. A fire ensued which was allowed to spread, eventually razing to the ground 61 homes in the overwhelmingly African American neighborhood.Eleven people in the Move house, including five children, died in the inferno. Chuck Africa’s cousin, Frank, was among the adults who were killed.All the paroled members of the Move 9 are now preparing to mark the 35th anniversary of the tragedy. For the first time they will be able to commemorate the event and the relatives and peers they lost outside a prison cell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

Losing a crop variety is as irreversible as the extinction of an animal or bird.On 25 February, nine Cherokee seeds will be deposited into the vault, deep inside a mountain on permanently frozen ground called permafrost.The seeds chosen are Cherokee white eagle corn – the tribe’s most sacred corn, used for cultural ceremonies – Cherokee long greasy beans, Cherokee Trail of Tears beans, Cherokee turkey gizzard black and brown beans, Cherokee candy roaster squash and three other varieties of corn. The crops predate European settlement and are a core part of Cherokee identity.The Cherokee seeds will be only the second deposit from an indigenous community to be stored in the Svalbard vault, following the deposit of 750 South American Andean potato seeds in 2015. “The Cherokee nation is the only place on the planet where all these crops are grown, and these days tough weather patterns make the situation precarious,” Pat Gwin, the tribe’s senior director of environmental resources, told the  from Oklahoma.Oklahoma is prone to tornadoes and has suffered two record droughts and multiple floods in the past decade. Extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis are on the rise.There are more than 1,700 food gene banks across the world but many are considered vulnerable to natural catastrophes, war, funding deficits, erratic electricity or poor management.The Svalbard vault, which has the capacity to hold 4.5m crop varieties, was created in conditions resilient to natural and manmade disasters, in order to safeguard duplicates of samples kept elsewhere. It is well above sea level and the permafrost and thick rock ensure seeds remain frozen even without power. The vault is only accessible via a 120-metre tunnel.Svalbard includes unique varieties of African and Asian staples such as maize, rice, wheat and sorghum, as well as European and South American varieties of aubergine, lettuce, barley and potato. About 500 seeds of each variety are stored at -18C in sealed foil packages.The climate crisis is still a threat: the vault has required multimillion-dollar upgrades to prevent flooding caused by extreme rainfall and melting of the permafrost.“Svalbard is the ultimate failsafe for bioersity of crops,” said Stefan Schmitz, executive director of the Crop Trust, which manages the vault with the Norwegian government and the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. “It’s important for the Cherokee nation to have this vital back-up.”It has been a long road. In 1838, 15,000 Cherokee were expelled by US military and militia from their homelands in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, then forced west to Indian territory, present-day Oklahoma. The Cherokee lost about a quarter of their people and their traditional plants and crops.Inspired by the Svalbard vault, tribal scientists led by Gwin spent several years tracking down “lost” crops in former territories and museums. They started two tribal gardens in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, dedicating one to cultivating 24 of the most significant Cherokee crops.Medicinal and inedible plants such as river cane, a type of bamboo traditionally used for construction, are also grown. Thousands of seed packets are sent each year to Cherokees across the world.“As long as Cherokee plants exist, we exist. This is so important,” said Gwin, 56. “We consider our plants to be as genetically Cherokee as we are.”In a statement, Chuck Hoskin Jr, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, said: “It is such an honor to have a piece of our culture preserved forever. Generations from now, these seeds will still hold our history and there will always be a part of the Cherokee Nation in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a396c903cc2e291f4448460b416f4bbbc4931e57/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f21d37305732a0232acd3da4f2471b6","title":"coronavirus royal caribbean cruise bans chinese nationals","story":"The US cruise ship company Royal Caribbean has announced that would-be passengers and crew with Chinese passports will be banned from all of its cruise ships – regardless of when they were last in the country at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak.The measure – which also covers people with Hong Kong and Macau passports – comes amid growing concerns over the fast-spreading virus, which has killed more than 700 people and affected iniduals in at least 25 countries.But it was likely to face criticism from Beijing, which has bridled at sweeping travel bans on its citizens, and from human rights activists who have denounced such restrictions as discriminatory.Friday’s announcement by the Miami-based company came after four travelers who were onboard the company’s Anthem of the Seas cruise ship were hospitalized in New Jersey after experiencing feverish symptoms. According to Royal Caribbean, the passengers had come from China for the cruise from the port of Bayonne, New Jersey, to the Bahamas, and were hospitalized out of caution.They added, however, that one guest did test positive for influenza A. The CDC reports no one in New Jersey has been found with the virus so far.The four are among more than two dozen Chinese nationals who were screened for signs of the new virus onboard the cruise ship. None of them were reportedly from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak.Earlier this week, after the US government announced it would quarantine US citizens returning from certain parts of mainland China, the American Civil Liberties Union responded by saying the measures “fly in the face of considerable evidence that travel bans and quarantines can do more harm than good”.“The more dangerous the actual outbreak, the more critical it becomes that we respond in ways that are grounded in science,” analyst Jay Stanley said in a statement at the time.The ACLU has not yet responded to requests for comment on Royal Caribbean’s specific ban.Royal Caribbean instituted other new boarding restrictions and passenger screenings in response to the virus, including mandatory screenings performed for guests unsure about their recent contact with others, or those who experience flu-like symptoms.“We take this very seriously and have a responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy environment onboard our ships, as well as in the ports we visit,” the statement read.Royal Caribbean acknowledged potential backlash in their statement.“In alignment with new stricter CDC protocols, we are tightening our measures to protect guests and crew. These steps are intentionally conservative, and we apologize that they will inconvenience some of our guests,” the cruise line said in a statement.The ship departs again on Saturday and announced passengers would be compensated with an onboard credit for the day lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39634dc981e299bd531074916760f15bad4aa1cf/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f15d2dacddb9be19acc36600121499","title":"coronavirus five new cases in france are british nationals","story":"Child among ski chalet group who came into contact with Briton who had been in SingaporeFive British nationals including a child have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in France, after staying in the same ski chalet and coming into contact with a Briton who had been in Singapore, the French health minister said.Agnès Buzyn said none of the patients were in a serious condition.She described the new outbreak as a “cluster, grouping around one original case” and said it had occurred in the Haute Savoie region in the eastern French Alps.“That original case was brought to our attention last night,” she said. “It is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between 20 and 23 January, and he arrived in France on 24 January for four days.”The Briton at the origin of the cluster had since returned to the UK.The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, called a meeting of health ministers on Saturday and the ministry has opened a hotline (0800 100 379) in an attempt to find out who else may have been in contact with the Britons.“We’re starting an important operation to identify cases of those in contact,” Buzyn said.The mayor of Contamines-Montjoie, Etienne Jacquet, said the 11 Britons in hospital in France had stayed at two separate chalets in the ski resort. The local health authority is disinfecting the two buildings and is searching for anyone who might have come in contact with the group.“There is no reason to panic because the health authority is right now looking for people who might have been in contact with those who are sick.”The new cases were part of a group of Britons who had stayed at a chalet in the ski resort. As well as the five who tested positive for the virus, the others were being kept under surveillance in hospitals in Lyon, Saint Etienne and Grenoble.Grenoble hospital said it was not authorised to give any more information. The director of the regional health authority is expected to give a press conference on Saturday afternoon.The latest outbreak brings the total number of people infected with the virus in France to 11. Health officials said some of the original six cases, being treated in hospital in Paris and Bordeaux, were ready to be released.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.This Saturday is one of the busiest days of the year for French ski resorts because it is the start of school holidays in the Paris region.At a newsagents shop in Contamines-Montjoie one resident said local people were worried.“It’s not just the news but the disinformation that’s worrying,” she said.Other shops and hotels referred callers to the local town hall.Les Contamines-Montjoie, 75 minutes from Geneva and sitting between Chamonix and Megève, has a population of about 1,160 people which is swelled by an influx of tourists every winter. It is close to Mont Blanc and popular with mountaineers and skiiers. The word contamines does not mean “contaminated” as some supposed on social media but “ploughable land on the squire’s estate”.Meanwhile, a student in Brighton has been told to self-isolate after a confirmed case of coronavirus in Brighton, according to Sky News. The middle-aged man was the first British national to contract the virus after he travelled to the UK from Singapore.In a message sent to parents on Friday, Portslade Aldridge Community Academy (PACA) said: “Today we have been contacted by a parent of a student at PACA who was contacted by Public Health England as part of their investigation concerning the confirmed case that was reported in the press yesterday.“We have been informed by the parent that they have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate their child at home for 14 days. If at any point the child is found to be symptomatic we will be notified.” Four members of a British family living in Mallorca are being tested for the coronavirus after coming into contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France.The Balearic Islands health department said the father of the family had gone to Mallorca’s Son Espases hospital after feeling ill and was placed in isolation. His partner and their two daughters were being evaluated in the same hospital.The health department said it had activated its coronavirus protocol. “In accordance with professional guidelines, the man remains in isolation and all members of the family have been tested and the tests sent to a laboratory. All remain at the hospital,” it said.The department urged people to remain calm while the tests were carried out and said it was working closely with Spain’s health ministry.Spain confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on 31 January after a man was diagnosed on the remote La Gomera island in the Canaries.The patient is part of a group of five people in isolation and under observation on the island after it emerged they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. US officials have announced that a 60-year-old citizen had become the first foreign victim of the coronavirus in China. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, having had symptoms consistent with the disease.A US embassy spokesman in Beijing told Reuters: “We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.” A British man with the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits after being transferred from the cruise ship Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan.Alan Steele, of Wolverhampton, who was on honeymoon on the ship, was moved to hospital on Friday while his wife, Wendy Marshall Steele, remained onboard. She had been in telephone contact with her husband and said on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy.“Alan is well, Japanese doctors are excellent,” she posted on Facebook. “He is in a little room. Just doctor and nurse visit him.” She said she was also doing well but had “cabin fever” as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship.There are nearly 3,700 other passengers and crew being quarantined on the ship. They have been offered access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access.In a video posted on Twitter, Rai Caluori, the executive vice-president at Princess Cruises, said: “We recognise that a situation like this can create unprecedented stress, so we’re also offering our guests and crew specialised telephonic mental health counselling if they should be experiencing such stress and mental health issues.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4157559.1580475841!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new year plant hunt gives young keen diligent botanists adrenaline spike","story":"Twitchers are a more intent species, as it were, than mere birdwatchers, but botanists seem to lack their ultimate compulsion. This may be just as well, since a rare plant, ringed suddenly by too many boots, has no means of flying away.Today’s botanists, however, increasingly young, keen and anoraked, do spike one occasion with adrenaline: the new year plant hunt on January 1st. How many flowering plants could you list in three hours of scouring the local ground? Even more competitively, who is to claim the First Flower of the Hunt? The really keen, it seems, have it photographed by torchlight shortly after midnight. On New Year’s Day 2019, for example, one Ger Collard from Tralee, Co Kerry, submitted pictures of five plants before 12.30 am.Collard is a member of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI). Its acronym was adjusted in 2013 from its claim to the whole “British Isles,” such had been the historical weight of visiting experts from next door. Some would have laid a colonial claim to the Burren. But Ireland’s sterling fieldwork for a massive new flora secured us our rightful placeIts latest plant hunt, the ninth, involved 1,714 people, from Shetland to Guernsey, Donegal to Norfolk, west Cork to Kent. Often searching in family groups, they recorded more species in bloom – 615 – than ever before.The highest totals, predictably, were from the south and west of both islands. Swanage, on the UK south coast, had the longest list of 115. In fourth place came 85 species at Ballycullane, Co Wexford, from experienced Irish recorder Paul Green.The long-term objective of the hunt is to see how the wildflowers of these islands are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate. In the survey’s brief record, the latest hunt was pretty average. “We can’t yet prove that more species are flowering in mid-winter,” says Dr Kevin Walker, the BSBI’s chief scientist. But the hunt has already shown that, in milder winters, more plants flower because of warmer temperatures and fewer frosts.On January 25th, a Kerry reader sent Eye on Nature a cheering photograph of lesser celandines in flower, a week or two ahead of normal schedule. But only 24 per cent of the BSBI’s new year flowers were springtime specialists such as celandine and primrose, so there was “no indication of an early spring”.Indeed, more than half were wayside autumn stragglers such as yarrow, ragwort and hogweed. And the leading species, topped by daisy, groundsel and dandelion, commonly offer mid-winter blooms.The ready use of common wildflower names, where appropriate, alongside the Latin binomials of Linnaeus, marks the modern informality of botany. It’s true that in papers at Ireland’s spring conference in the National Botanic Gardens, something such as festuca grasses may be salted with Latin names – that’s science. But, more and more, diligent amateurs are joining surveys with professionals, enlivening online websites and blogs, and painlessly absorbing the weighty fistful of Webb’s Irish Flora.Ireland even has a team known at the Rough Crew, led by Dr Rory Hodd, “ecologist, botanist and montivagant, with a passion for liverworts, mosses and mountains”. A montivagant is, indeed, a wanderer over hills and mountains, and Hodd inspires an adventurous troupe of young followers – typically three women and five men – to seek out the plants of rain-soaked ledges on the high, rocky scarps and ravines of the west.Much of this is pursued on the mountains and islands of Co Mayo, where the rocks themselves are of infinite variety and interest. That is, if one could master enough geology to tell them apart and fit their shapes and stories into the landscape.An engaging encouragement has been published by Mayo County Council in Reading the Rocks (€15 in local bookshops). A geological audit produced an impressive choice of more than 100 significant sites in Mayo, some of international note, such as the metamorphic rocks of the Mullet Peninsula, 1.75 billion years old.From these, two geologists at NUI Galway, Dr Ronan Hennessy and Prof Martin Feely selected 21 sites to show the great range of Mayo’s geological story. Many are strikingly photogenic, such as the great sea stack of Dun Briste at the tip of Downpatrick Head. And “there is never the necessity”, the publisher warns, “to hammer, dig or collect samples”.Carrowniskey Strand, south of Louisburgh, is well featured in the book. It was my own early hunting ground for huge and beautiful pebbles, glacially gathered and rounded in the sea, and Reading the Rocks would have helped me with their story before the great storms that swept so much of them away.A stubborn obstacle to enjoying books about geology is their unchippable sediment of science-speak. This one has a generous glossary, usefully unpacking the information condensed into single terms. But arriving at, say, “ophiotic melange”, I think I’d still rather scramble through the awns, bracts, corymbs and corollas of botany."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Winds of 130 kmh expected as Met \u0026Eacuteireann upgrades weather warningLiam Edward O\u0026rsquoSullivan, a father-of-five, died following incident on ThursdayWhat do you need to vote?

Traffic for the city centre and west Galway is also mixed with traffic for Briarhill and Ballybrit business parks. The current route continues to be severely congested crossing the Tuam Road and on to the Headford Road.Traffic volumes at the start of the route are just under 30,000 vehicles a day and just under 25,000 vehicles a day between the Tuam and Headford roads.Google Maps, which monitors traffic in real time, last week advised motorists to allow 44 minutes from the Coolagh Roundabout to the Headfort Road at peak times, a distance of just 6.5km.Traffic volumes fall off rapidly once motorists cross the Corrib heading west and it is this “western region” that Galway city and council councils want the road to open to development.The aims also include opening up existing road space for pedestrians and “smarter travel” such as cycleways, improving air quality in the city centre as well as access to University College Galway and NUIG.‘Attractiveness’ and ‘opportunities’In a statement, Galway County Council, which is developing the scheme on behalf of itself and Galway City Council, said “an efficient transport network which works for Galway city and environs will improve access to the western region, enhancing its attractiveness for inward investment and new employment opportunities and will contribute to enhanced competitiveness by reducing transport costs”.The council said “delivery of the road will have a major positive impact on the quality of life of the thousands of people living in the area”. It said the road was “congruent with current transport policy and planning policy as set out in the various policy documents over the past number of years”.The council’s project team will present the case for the proposed ring road at an oral hearing organised by An Bord Pleanála on February 18th. The planning hearing will begin at the G Hotel at 10am. It is expected to continue for several weeks.At the same time, An Bord Pleanála will consider an application for the compulsory purchase of 54 homes which are required for the project to go ahead.Environmental campaigner Peter Sweetman, who took a case against previous plans for the outer bypass of the city, has also objected to the current scheme."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4166763.1581153898!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"voters go to the polls after parties hear demand for change from electorate","story":"Voters on the islands off the coasts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway are going to the polls one day ahead of the rest of the country.

That could set us backwards, so people have a big decision to make.”Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has repeatedly ruled out a coalition with Sinn Féin and said he wants to form a government with Labour, the Greens, the Social Democrats and other like-minded parties.“Fianna Fáil has the realistic, doable programme for a new government, particularly in terms of urgent action on the health services and housing with the building of new council and affordable homes.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said: “I have been talking to a lot of voters over the past few weeks, a lot of people want change and Sinn Féin is the vehicle for that change.”Ms McDonald’s party is expecting a strong showing but, because it is only running 42 candidates, is unlikely to be in a position to lead a government.While a polling card is not needed to vote today, all voters should bring identification.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149058.1580234896!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 everything you need to know","story":"And they are off...  as the election for the 33rd Dáil begins,  Political Editor Pat Leahy predicts what the big issues will be.

If in doubt, visit checktheregister.ie to see if your name is listed. You can also call your local authority for confirmation. However, if you’re not on the list it’s too late to register.\u0026nbsp Only Irish and British citizens aged 18 or older and residing in the State can vote in an Irish general election.\u0026nbspWhat time can I vote tomorrow? Polling stations open at 7am and will remain open until 10pm. As this election is taking place on a Saturday, it’s unclear when will be the busiest times to vote. However, the general consensus is to get out early and not leave your vote to\u0026nbspthe last minute.\u0026nbspI don’t know where my polling station is, where do I find that out?

The Department of Local Government has underlined that voters on the register do not need a polling\u0026nbspcard to vote as a number of other forms of identification are acceptable.These include a passport, driving licence, public services card, an employee identity card containing a photograph, a student identity card with a photograph, a travel document with a photograph and name, or a bank, savings or credit union book with the voter’s address in the constituency.Voters can also show a cheque book, cheque or credit card, birth or marriage certificate, once they produce one of these with a document showing their address in the constituency.How do I vote?You must mark your ballot card in order of preference which means writing the number 1 opposite your first choice of candidate, followed by 2 for your second favourite, 3 for the third, and so on.\u0026nbspOnly give one number 1 vote. Two number 1s will spoil your vote.\u0026nbspDo not mark the boxes with an X or tick. This will spoil your vote.Do not add notes beside candidates’ photos, write slogans or draw pictures. This will spoil your vote.\u0026nbspThere were 18,398 spoiled votes in the 2016 general election. Don’t be a fool and join that crew.\u0026nbspShould I vote all the way down the ballot paper? Yes. To maximise the impact of your vote it is best to give every candidate a preference. Give your first preference to the candidate you most want to see elected and then in descending order of preference down to the one you like least. \u0026nbsp It’s true that failing to vote right down through the list has only a marginal effect. But if this is repeated on a widespread basis by fellow voters it can actually assist a candidate who you would prefer to see defeated by lowering the effective quota, and making it easier for himher to reach it.\u0026nbsp  As an election proceeds and the number of non-transferable votes accumulates, the number required to be elected – the effective quota – falls.The key thing to remember is that a lower preference can never interfere with a higher one. Your number two will only come into play if your first preference is eliminated or elected and so on.Can I take a photo in the polling station? No. No selfies or ballot pics while at the station.\u0026nbspSome younger voters may be excited about taking part in their first ever national election but please, NO SELFIES!How do transfers work? After the first count when all the number ones have been counted,\u0026nbspthe surplus votes of a\u0026nbspsuccessful candidate who has exceeded the quota will be distributed.This is done by checking the second preferences on all the ballot papers of the candidate and distributing his or her number twos in proportion.When all the first-count surpluses have been distributed or if no candidate has been elected\u0026nbspthe returning officer will then move on to eliminating the candidate with the lowest number of votes and distributing their votes.One way of voting tactically is that by going all the way down the ballot paper you can support the candidate or party you want with high preferences while attempting to stop the ones you like least by putting them at the very end. Another way of voting tactically is that where a party is running more than one candidate, committed supporters are advised to give the number one to the weakest candidate on the ticket to maximise the party’s chances of winning more than one seat. If the candidate is eliminated, the vote will not be wasted as the next preference will automatically be counted.What about the weather?

In this 2016 video featuring the late Noel Whelan, we explain how it works. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt least half the ballot papers cast on Saturday will not be counted beyond the number one. File photograph: CollinsOur single transferrable vote system of proportional representation – or\u0026nbspPR-STV – is one of the most flexible and subtle systems anywhere in the world. It enables voters to support the candidate or party they like best, even if they have little or no chance of being elected, and then using their preferences to ensure that their vote moves on to a candidate with a real chance of making it to the Dáil. While it is not strictly proportional it is much fairer than the straight vote system in the UK or the US.Should you vote all the way down the ballot paper?Yes. To maximise the impact of your vote it is best to give every candidate a preference. Give your first preference to the candidate you most want to see elected and then in descending order of preference down to the one you like least.You don’t have to do this and can stop at whatever point you want and your vote will still be valid but to have maximum impact it is best to use all your preferences. The key thing to remember is that a lower preference can never interfere with a higher one. Your number two will only come into play if your first preference is eliminated or elected and so on.So how does the system work?From a voter’s perspective STV is very simple. Just rank the candidates in order of your choice starting with 1. The counting of votes is a different matter and can appear very complicated to the uninitiated. The first thing to understand is that a quota is set for each constituency depending on the number of seats to be filled and the number of people who have voted. The quota is arrived at by iding the number of valid votes by the number of seats plus one, and then adding one to the resulting total.For instance if 40,000 votes are cast in a three-seat constituency the quota would be calculated by iding the number of votes by four and then adding one making it 10,001. The formula means that no more than three people can reach the quota.How do transfers work?After the first count when all the number ones have been counted the first thing to happen is that the surplus votes of a successful candidate who has exceeded the quota will be distributed. This is done by checking the second preferences on all the ballot papers of the candidate and distributing his or her number twos in proportion.When all the first-count surpluses have been distributed the returning officer will then move on to eliminating the candidate with the lowest number of votes. The number twos will be counted and allocated to the other candidates. The next lowest will be eliminated and so on until there are only three candidates left for the three seats.But where does a number four or five or even lower preference come in?As the counts progress a vote that was cast for a candidate eliminated early in the count will move on to the number two. If that candidate is eliminated in turn it will go on to number three and so on. If the candidate getting the number two is already elected or eliminated the vote will move on to the next available candidate still in the race.There is a complication about distributing the surplus of a candidate elected after the first count with the help of transfers. Instead of counting all of the candidate’s votes to allocate the next available preference, only the last bundles of votes received are counted to see where the next preferences goes.What is meant by tactical voting?One way of voting tactically is that by going all the way down the ballot paper you can support the candidate or party you want with high preferences while attempting to stop the ones you like least by putting them at the very end.Another way of voting tactically is that where a party is running more than one candidate, committed supporters are advised to give the number one to the weakest candidate on the ticket to maximise the party’s chances of winning more than one seat. If the candidate is eliminated, the vote will not be wasted as the next preference will automatically be counted.Are all the preferences on all ballot papers counted?No. At least half the ballot papers cast on Saturday will not be counted beyond the number one. If the number one goes to a candidate who is in contention for a seat but does not exceed the quota at any stage the second preference will not be counted. Many of the seats will be filled by candidates who fall just short of a quota on the final count. Even if a candidate exceeds the quota after the first count only a small proportion of the next preferences will be counted as part of a surplus.What is a spoiled vote?A small proportion of votes are spoiled in every election because the voter has not clearly indicated a preference. This sometimes happens because a number 1 is given to more than one candidate. Often votes are spoiled on purpose with slogans written on the ballot paper by disgruntled voters.Is the STV system or PR a uniquely Irish one?No. It was imposed on this country as part of the Home Rule Act in 1912 and later incorporated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 with the objective of protecting the unionist minority and ensuring they had representation in an Irish parliament. The system was later included in de Valera’s 1937 constitution and two attempts to abolish it, in 1959 and 1966, were rejected by the electorate. The same system is used in Malta, the Australian senate and Northern Ireland Assembly.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Thailand mass shooting: soldier livestreams rampage which leaves 10 deadCoronavirus latest news: Five British people diagnosed in French ski resortBritish family of five test positive for coronavirus in French AlpsComment: The Democrats have Trump to thank for their existential collapseComment: It\u0026#39s a bit mean not to give Prince Andrew a flag to fly for his birthdayComment: Turning a chapel into a multi-faith room is a victory for soulless neutrality Comment: The secret to beating Coronavirus is in our handsStorm Ciara: Forecasters warn 80mph winds could pose a danger to lifeAirports told to stop using millions of plastic bags at security and find sustainable alternativesComment: Like broadband, access to cashpoints should be a legal rightComment: Why it’s time to stop gunning for David Cameron’s bodyguardThere\u0026#39s \u0026#39an explosion\u0026#39 of food allergies - but what\u0026#39s behind the boom?Pete Buttigieg accused of wanting to \u0026#39watch cartoons\u0026#39 as Democrats turn fire on young presidential hopefulMPs urged to boost trainee police officers\u0026#39 pay to aid recruitmentBeatrice to have low-key wedding in wake of Duke\u0026#39s Epstein troublesHow an ordinary doctor\u0026#39s death from coronavirus poses the greatest internal threat to Chinese authorities in years BBC viewers who watch less could pay less under proposals for licence fee \u0026#39tiers\u0026#39Boris Johnson plans new law to exert more control over NHSYouth criminal cases hit by record delays, taking 5 months to be heard We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/05/10/parliament.jpg","title":"brexit wellbeing britons life satisfaction survey ons","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.People\u0027s concerns about the general economic outlook also continued to grow up to September 2019, reaching their highest level since late 2011Britons said their life satisfaction fell last autumn compared with the year before as concerns about future employment prospects grew, according to an official measure of well-being.The Office for National Statistics’ measure of average life satisfaction decreased by 0.7 per cent in the three months to September — a time of political turbulence over Brexit — compared with a year earlier.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016.

We stand in full solidarity with staff who are taking strike action.”University staff will pay around £40,000 more into their pension – but they will receive nearly £200,000 less in retirement following reforms to the pension scheme, the UCU says.Increased contributions and other changes to the universities superannuation scheme\u0026nbspmean many people are suffering substantial losses, the union has previously warned.Jo Grady, general secretary of the UCU, said: “We are on the same side in this dispute and we hope students across the UK will put pressure on their vice-chancellors and principals to send the employers’ representatives back to the negotiating table with a clear mandate to work seriously with us to try and resolve them without the need for further action.”A Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said: “Universities understand that missed teaching time is unsettling and will try to ensure that students do not miss out by providing replacement teaching and learning resources.\u0026nbspIf students feel these are inadequate, they should take this up with their university in the first instance.\u0026nbsp“If they are not satisfied with the response they can complain to the relevant ombudsman for their country and they could be entitled to financial compensation if reasonable alternative arrangements were not put in place.”University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so. That is similarly intended to allow people to better understand their feed, and get rid of anyone they followed a long time ago but no longer wish to see posts from.Selena Gomez says Instagram is ‘destroying’ some of her generationAll of the features are intended to allow people to have more control of their news feed and hopefully better curate what they want to see.“Instagram is really about bringing you closer to the people and things you care about — but we know that over time, your interests and relationships can evolve and change,” a spokesperson said.“Whether you graduate, move to a new city, or become obsessed with a new interest and find a community, we want to make it easier to manage the accounts you follow on Instagram so that they best represent your current connections and interests.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.“My phone was blowing up,” he recalled. “Everyone and their mother was texting me from all over the world to tell me that my phone was on and I was live-broadcasting the movie.\u0026nbsp“Of course, I’m a gentleman, so I don’t check my phone during movies.”Eventually, someone was sent to inform Ruffalo that his phone was on. “I pulled it out and I was like, ‘Ohhhhh.... s**t.’”X-Men character to be ‘introduced as villain’ in Captain Marvel sequelDisney announces when its big new Marvel TV shows will be releasedMarvel gives first look at Loki TV show in Super Bowl spotIn the aftermath, Ruffalo received a tense phonecall from Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige: “He was like, ‘What are you doing man?’ I told him, ‘Kevin, it was an accident, I swear to God.’”The following day, the Hulk actor had to see Feige in person to do press for the film.“I walk over to him to say sorry, and he grabs me in a bear hug,” Ruffalo recalled. “And he’s like.... ‘That was genius! We got more press from that than the entire premiere! We couldn’t have imagined doing something that good!’”Ruffalo appeared on Norton’s red sofa along with David Schwimmer, Tamsin Greig, and actor and comedian Nick Mohammed.\u0026nbspIn other Marvel news,\u0026nbspSuperhero Buzz’s Mikey Sutton is circulating the rumour that Marvel president Kevin Feige is lining up an X-Men character to be the villain in Captain Marvel 2 – read more on that here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were to be the last pieces of the lunar surface to come back to Earth, since humanity has not been back in the nearly 50 years since.That means that those remaining samples are especially precious since they are limited and can not be easily replaced. They can also be profoundly illuminating, offering us our only chance to get close to rock taken from a whole separate world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It\u0027s the first time a lunar sample has been studied like this. We\u0027re using a technique many geologists haven\u0027t even heard of.Scientists to make air out of lunar dust amid plans to live on MoonAs researchers make use of the new technique, they expect to find a vast set of new information about the lunar surface.We can apply this technique to samples no one has studied, Philipp Heck, a curator at the Field Museum, associate professor at the University of Chicago, and co-author of the paper, adds. You\u0027re almost guaranteed to find something new or unexpected.This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn\u0027t find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample.The technique is called atom probe tomography, and involves incredibly precise manipulation of inidual grains. It has previously been used in industrial processes – but the new breakthrough has come in turning it for the first time to lunar samples.It works something like nanocarpentry, said Professor Heck: like a carpenter shapes wood, we do it at the nanoscale to minerals.The sample is placed inside a special probe and then shot with a laser that knocks off inidual atoms, which then fall onto a special plate. Researchers can examine those elements by timing how long they take to hit the detector – since heavier ones take longer – and so the type of atom can be worked out.It has already helped researchers see the weathering and materials that can be found inside the lunar soil. That in turn could help future astronauts as they move to live on the Moon, since they could survive by taking resources out of that dust.The researchers now hope they can get hold of samples from elsewhere on the Moon, and elsewhere in space, to allow them to better understand the makeup of the worlds that surround us. They compare our current understanding to analysing Earth using only one mountain range – to get a fuller grasp, they will need to examine a variety of terrains across the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It feels like I’m losing my mind’Ministers have admitted a mobile phone outage at removal centres has prevented people from accessing legal\u0026nbspservices to challenge their deportation, days before a charter flight is set to leave the UK.The Home Office has been forced to admit it has known about the issue affecting detainees’ mobile phone signals in detention centres near Heathrow airport since 13 January, but took 23 days to begin providing detainees with working sim\u0026nbspcards – during which it pressed ahead with charter flights to Ghana, Nigeria and France.Campaigners accused the government of removing people from the country without giving them their lawful right to legal advice and assistance during\u0026nbspthe “crucial window” leading up to the removal flights.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPeople who are due to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica on Tuesday told The Independent that as a result of the outage, they had struggled to communicate with their solicitors and send them relevant documents to challenge their removals.Mobile phones provided by the Home Office at the outset of detention are the principal means by which detainees are able to access legal assistance, contact their solicitors and stay in touch with their families.Government told to review deportations days before charter flightEchard Bepart-Woollett, 27, who came to Britain when he was eight\u0026nbspand has two British children, said he had been struggling to communicate with his solicitor since the Home Office issued him with deportation orders last week.“I can’t get hold of my solicitor – the only chance of getting out of here. It’s getting mad. It feels like I’m losing my mind. It’s like all communication has been shut down. Everyone is trying to get hold of their solicitor to see what’s going on,” said the Jamaican national.“If they don’t get the paperwork, I can’t go to court, I can’t fight. It’s black and white. You need everything documented and proven, and if I can’t get that out, then I’m f***ed.”Mr Bepart-Woollett’s solicitor, Marina Khan of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said her client had a strong case\u0026nbspto remain in Britain but that the mobile outages had meant filing submissions to challenge his deportation has taken much longer than normal.“We were trying to contact him every day since he instructed us on 31 January, and it took us until 6 February\u0026nbspto formally take details instructions from him. It’s been awful. His partner was stressing out,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My phone just doesn’t ring. I haven’t spoken to my solicitor directly at all because of the signal. It’s been a huge added stress. I don’t know what’s going on,” he said.“It’s stopping me talking to my family as well. My daughter knows my voice. If I say something over the phone, she’s thinking Daddy’s home. I say her name and she looks up for me. But this signal is preventing me from talking to her.”People facing imminent removal from the UK are entitled to notice periods ranging from three to five days during which it is, by law, vital that they are able to access legal advice and assistance, for example to assess the merits of challenging their removal.Windrush victims given additional two years to apply for compensation‘Home Office is destroying their lives’: Father-of-two to be deportedGovernment told to review deportations days before charter flightBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, which has launched a legal challenge against the Home Office over its alleged failure to provide effective access to legal advice to detainees, said: “An eleventh-hour issuing of sim cards may not be sufficient for those seeking to challenge their removal on Tuesday’s flight. Not to mention the impact on those that have been removed while the signal has been down.\u0026nbsp“This is a partial victory for access to justice but there are many unanswered questions and our legal challenge will proceed.”It comes after a\u0026nbspleaked draft of the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspLessons Learned\u0026nbspreview stated that ministers should consider ending the practice of deporting people who arrived in the UK as children, prompting calls for the Home Office to put\u0026nbspdeportation flight on hold until the review is published.The Home Office has been approached for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home,the PM\u0026nbspsaid on Saturday. We have ample supplies, so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles, tinned food, or toilet paper, as some people did yesterday.UK to donate £5m to World Health OrganisationThe Department for International Development said the sum would help the WHO prevent the spread of the virus in developing countries,\u0026nbspby supporting them to rapidly identify and care for patients with symptoms.Additional experts funded by UK aid will be deployed to the WHO to help coordinate the international response, the\u0026nbspstatement said.This week, the UN health agency asked the international community for $560m to help their efforts to combat the virus.On Friday, the United States signalled it would donate $100m in foreign aid to help the response in China and other countries.A child is among the five British nationals\u0026nbspwho have contracted the virus in France.They were all staying in the same chalet in a ski resort in Haute-Savoie.The initial case had recently travelled to Singapore, health minister Agnes Buzyn said.British family of four hospitalised in MajorcaA couple and their two children have been admitted to hospital on the Spanish island, after coming into contact with someone suffering from the virus, reports suggest.The father reportedly went to Son Espases hospital in Palma on Thursday to inform them he had been in contact with someone who had contracted the virus and was quarantined there.

Punishing non-payers nowadays is absurd.The Beeb will fight all the way. But consider how it has trashed its once-proud reputation:Fundamentally it’s a dinosaur in the Netflix era and irrelevant to many, especially young people raised on YouTube.The Government must be bold. We need a much slimmer BBC to survive and focus on quality TV and radio.But the licence has had its day.BORIS Johnson can only lead the world on climate change with the public on his side and our economy in the front of his mind.The Government churns out random dates in the not-too-distant future by which it demands we all buy electric cars and replace our gas central heating.Yes, the UK is hosting a climate summit this year and it must be ambitious.But do the Tories have a clue about the cost to consumers and the economy  Michael Gove was suspiciously coy.This country is not governed by Greta Thunberg — nor the Marxist wreckers running Extinction Rebellion.The Tories must level with the public and ensure that our global warming efforts BOOST the economy instead of wrecking it.And they will be near-worthless anyway unless the world’s worst polluters, China in particular, follow the example Britain is already setting in slashing emissions.JIHADIST murderers and their supporters should be judged criminally insane and held indefinitely as long as they are a danger.Most villains recognise our civilisation’s definitions of right and wrong.IS do not. Their extreme version of Islam legitimises slaughtering innocent people.Anyone  randomly stabbing ­passers-by or encouraging it would probably be classed as insane and locked away forever. Why not jihadis  The fact they consider their motives rational and noble proves they have lost their minds.Lesser offenders may be deradicalised, though that is a long shot. Others should be kept without time limit in a secure unit, maybe built specically for them.If we treat these religious madmen like “ordinary” murderers — with a stretch in a normal prison — we will keep making the same disastrous mistakes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which is not surprising when they are at least £, more than the petrol equivalent and most have woeful mileage ranges.Yet the Government, desperate to advertise its green credentials, blithely announces a ban on new petrol, diesel and even hybrid cars in just  years.But it’s not a concrete, costed plan . . . just a giant leap in the dark.How does it intend to totally re-equip Britain for roadside charging — or fund it while its multi-billion pound fuel duty income withers away to nothing How will people afford these cars unless prices plummet, which experts say is unlikely in the foreseeable future  And why is the Government poised to axe the subsidies that help us to buy We don’t in principle think taxpayers should fund anyone’s new motor. But why remove buyers’ sole financial incentive now, when the industry badly needs a jump-start The Government is hopping on a bandwagon without considering the consequences, like Labour  years ago when it urged everyone to buy diesels.Meanwhile councils are already brainlessly instigating city centre bans or fines on all but the tiny number of zero-emission vehicles currently on the road.Who can blame motorists for being confused and angry  Many will happily drive more eco-friendly cars once they are viable and affordable.But this is all stick and no carrot.BRITAIN should not be proudly flying our flag for Prince Andrew’s birthday. It is a grotesque gesture in the circumstances.Maybe his long, close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein — a jailed paedophile, pimp and sex trafficker of under-age girls — was entirely innocent.But he has still been sacked from Royal duties and accused of ignoring FBI demands to question him.Epstein’s victims are adamant Andrew mustto the US.What an insult to themTown Halls raise the Union Jack to honour him instead.WHEN it comes to helping the disabled, Boris Johnson can put his money where his mouth is right now.We are delighted to see the PM ask every Cabinet minister to find ways their department can contribute to his new National Disability Strategy.But there’s a £million black hole in funding for social care for families with disabled kids which Sajid Javid’s Budget on March  should fill.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their bosses make mind-boggling salaries.It’s payback time.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick’s imaginative plan will cut prices for local first-time buyers by a third —  a huge dference.But the Government must ensure hundreds of thousands of affordable homes get built this way.Previous over-hyped initiatives have produced derisory numbers.Long-term we need a bonfire of planning restrictions,  more developers able to compete and far more houses built.Campaigners warned the new homes must not come at the expense of losing new social housing.Polly Neate, boss of Shelter, said: “The country desperately needs more low-cost homes which are genuinely affordable to those people struggling at the sharp end of the housing crisis.“But, instead of offering a route to building additional low cost homes, this policy simply puts at risk the social homes currently being built.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it saddened us all because it felt like this incredible human being would go on for ever.He headed the Douglas dynasty with a zest for le that put the rest of us to shame and was one of our final links to Hollywood’s golden age.Long before actors ostentatiously wore their hearts on their sleeves and made self-aggrandising speeches about the latest trendy cause, Kirk determinedly set out to do the right thing, regardless of any impact on his career.In the Fties, at the height of the Cold War, he stood up to a paranoid US government that considered anyone to the left of Genghis Khan a Soviet sympathiser.The McCarthy witchhunts ruined careers and wrecked lives, but Kirk dug in his heels and hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to work on Spartacus, which would become Kirk’s most famous movie.That took balls of steel.Kirk gave millions to charity and was a US Goodwill Ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in .He experienced heartache with the death of his son Eric from an overdose and the jailing of grandson Cameron for drug offences.But even a near-fatal helicopter crash and a stroke couldn’t defeat Kirk.His son Michael — a superstar in his own right, of course — told me last year his dad worked out almost every day with a personal trainer and remained as sharp as a tack, keeping the whole extended family on their toes.I was lucky enough to interview Kirk back in my days with TV-am.The Beeb would fly them over from LA and put them up in a posh hotel.All we could offer was a hearty breakfast, plus the chance to talk about themselves and their new project for as long as they liked.There were no pesky managers and PRs to go through.Bette Davis, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall and Sammy Davis Jnr all popped into our studio at the crack of sparrows, staying for the duration of the show.Kirk was here in , promoting Dance With The Devil, a racy novel that bore a passing resemblance to his extraordinary le story.After his Jewish parents escaped persecution in Russia, Kirk was born and raised in a poor area of New York.It is a real rags-to-riches tale. His dad actually worked as a rag-and-bone man.Kirk never forgot where he came from, which is perhaps why he became a champion for justice and a fairer society.He was a delight that morning and even laughed when the crew declared, “I’m Spartacus”, one after another in his honour — though he must have seen it done hundreds of times before.He was a also a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.The Douglas clan will be in mourning but they can celebrate a le well lived.This weekend, I am on a Kirk Douglas marathon, starting with Paths Of Glory, before The Bad And The Beautul, Ace In The Hole, The Vikings, Lust For Le and, of course, Spartacus.Tomorrow’s Oscars will rightly honour him. We won’t see his like again.I WAS honoured to host The Millies this week.It is a wonderful event run by The Sun to salute our Armed Forces and give us all a chance to say a huge thank you.As always, there were astonishing stories of bravery, courage and self-sacrice.And as always, our lovely winners told me they were nothing special, just doing their job.I honestly don’t think they realise just how remarkable they are, or how much we owe them.One of my highlights was seeing -year-old Private Fin Doherty collect his award for inspiring others.Fin was just six when his paratrooper big brother JJ was killed in action in Afghanistan.Fin was determined to follow in JJ’s footsteps to honour his brother’s memory, and join the Parachute Regiment.He has been an outstanding addition and, in an emotional ceremony, was presented with JJ’s beret in December.Their mum Joyce admits she struggled with Fin’s decision to sign up, following the death of her eldest son.But she knew it was all Fin wanted – and she is so very proud of him.We honestly don’t deserve such an inspirational young man. But thank the Lord we have him on our side.NOTHING has changed. Phillip Schofield is exactly the same person he was before he felt the time was right to tell the world he’s gay.He’s still a loving father and husband and will still host his TV shows with consummate professionalism and skill.As Phillip said himself, you never know what people are struggling with every day and, for him, it was time to be honest with himself and everyone .I’m really glad that he has made the decision and very proud of him, although obviously it can’t have been easy.There’s been lots of tears, sleepless nights and a great deal of soul-searching. I hope he now finds peace of mind.He is a very lucky man to have a family and friends who love him very much and just want him to be happy.He also has a loyal fan base who love watching him on This Morning and that won’t change. Why would it Of course, he can expect a small number of bigots and homophobes to spew out hateful bile, but they are to be pitied and ignored.Those carping about why he took so long also need to shut up.People should be allowed to come out when it feels the right time for them.Phillip began his career at a time when being openly gay in a TV presenting role was just not an option.Thank goodness things have changed and he can be open now – and know that the overwhelmingly vast majority of us wish him and his family nothing but the very best.I was really touched by what he said about interviewing brave people on This Morning, and realising that he had to be just like them and tell his truth.Love comes in many dferent forms.Phillip and his we Stephanie adore each other and that won’t change. Again, why on earth would it At the end of his statement Phillip urged us all to be kind, especially to his family, and I hope we all take those words on board.Let’s wish them all the best and let them get on with their lives.WHAT a furore over a bare shoulder. Actress-turned-MP Tracy Brabin didn’t deserve the vitriol about her outfit but it WAS distracting.It’s unfortunate because Tracy was making important points about journalists being shut out of No  briefings – a move that makes my blood run cold and threatens Press freedom. Sadly, no one was really listening.Tracy told me she had been at a music event and didn’t expect to be back in the House. She is bemused by all the fuss.How those in public le dress should not detract from their message, be it a female MP in a low-cut top or mini-skirt, or a man wearing a gaudy tie or tight trousers.Our MPs are not known for their style and rarely make headlines for their fashion sense.I am very happy for them to keep it that way.WELL, that was a rather ill-advised memo to send, reminding local councils to fly the Union Flag on February  as a “celebration” of Prince Andrew’s birthday.I had no idea this was a “thing” and that Andrew was on a list of VIPs whose birthdays are marked with a flag waving on the roof of our town halls, instead of just cake and prosecco like the rest of us.Unsurprisingly, this ludicrous edict has caused much disgruntlement.As we know, Andrew has been booted out of The Firm by his own mum after that disastrous TV interview delving into his friendship with the American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Then there is the ongoing scandal over whether or not Andrew will be interviewed by the FBI as part of its investigations into child trafficking allegations against Epstein.It is all very sordid and murky. Surely even his nearest and dearest would agree this is not the time for official celebrations.He is no longer a working royal and has no place on that list.Time to lower the flags for good. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was suddenly front-page news all over the world and he looked guilty as hell.Of what, we weren’t sure. But whatever it was, we all worked out that as he has a Bentley, he could definitely have got from a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking to the centre of London in less than six hours.A few weeks later, as the story was withering once more, Hank J Dieselburger, an American prosecutor involved in the dead sex-man’s case, announced that the FBI had received “zero co-operation” from Prince Andrew.You’d think Andrew would have learned from his earlier mistake.

I’ve worn nothing  since I was  and I’ve always loved their shop, the staff have always been brilliant. They always have what I need in stock and they never ask for my phone number or email address. I’m in and out in two minutes flat.This year, though, there was a disaster. There were two disinterested youths in there who looked at the label on the back of my jeans and said, “We don’t make those any more.”WHAT  ! !On the verge of fainting with shock, I dragged them back from their interesting conversation about Stormzy and was told in an exasperated fashion that I could still buy them online.This begs a question. What’s the point of having an expensive-to-run shopyou then fill it with people who tell you to go home and buy what you need on the net PETA, an organisation for animal enthusiasts who like to wear clothes made from crude oil, have announced that people often see their pet dog as nothing more than a cheap burglar alarm.Cheap You can buy a home alarm kit these days for less than £, whereas a proper dog is going to be way more than that.Plus, you only need feed an alarm with a tiny amount of electricity to keep it running, whereas a dog requires a bed, a blanket, food, water and, later on, vets bills that will make your eyes water.THIS week, a car crashed through my fence, turning it and an expensive new gate into matchsticks.By the time I got there, the car was gone. But there was still a lot of “police aware” tape fluttering about in the breeze.So I called the nearest station, which was approximately  miles away, as I needed to contact the driver to talk about insurance. Sadly, however, while the police are “aware” of the incident, they are not prepared to give me any details.Mustn’t grumble, though. While it will cost a few hundred quid to get everything mended, I must accept that the police have much more important things to do, such as investigating dead people who weren’t paedophiles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future. If not, she’ll become a footnote to the history of British media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Mirror has spent a week speaking to people behind the scenes, who work day in and day out to put the party into power, about what went wrong in Decemberaposs election.Speaking anonymously they warn of a ided party - with figures from both the left and right saying Labour faces an uphill battle to win in .Staff repeatedly shared concerns about a failure to tackle anti-Semitism and an obsession with political purity that gripped the party from the leadership down. One party adviser warned: The public donapost care about aposismsapos and ideologies, they want us to explain how we can fix their lives in a clear way that they can see being implemented. If we donapost stop acting like a lecture on economic theory we deserve to lose every seat we lost to the Tories forever. An ex-McDonnell staff member said they succeeded in doing a lot of work in making the radical look like the only reasonable answer but squandered that progress with infighting.For one MPaposs staff member the defeat was a clear consequence of Jeremy Corbyn and his record. They told the Mirror: People want to know why we ignored them, why we doubled down on a man to lead us who was, in their eyes, unfit to lead the country. The isions in the party are deep - and show no sign of softening as the race to pick Mr Cobynaposs successor picks up. One former confidant of Mr Corbyn said the next leader needed to double down on being the outsider to take the party back to power - eventhat comes at the expense of annoying some of his most loyal allies, Labouraposs left-wing trade unions. He said: When we sided with old politics of the machine left, which we did again and again from  onwards, we lost. Why  Because we became less special and more like every other politician wrestling in the grime for power. Our next leader needs to recognise we win when we look dferent from the rest of the political class.  But for other the challenges are more parochial, they say that the turmoil of the last few years has seen a brain drain, with decisions made badly or for the wrong reasons. A staff member in Labouraposs HQ said the next leader needed to less politicalLabour was to win. She added: That seems counter-intuitive, but at the last election, we lost seats we could have won because we were trying to defend political allies of the leadership, or a political reading of the electoral map, that wasnapost matched up by the data. We clawed an acceptable performance back in  by putting resources where they were needed not where the Leaderaposs team wanted them to be needed. You can read the Labour insiders anonymous verdicts below. Former staff member for Jeremy Corbyn We set out a pretty radical vision in  but didnapost win the argument for it. We had a choice, double down with something more radical or try and win the argument around our popular policies from the last election. We choose the first, made some bold offers - but in the end, it was too much and we werenapost believed. The next leader canapost just jettison everything weaposve done to make the arguments for socialism - but now we need to win them.  Community Organiser We made a lot of progress when we connected what we cared about in Parliament to the lives of actual people. Not MPs telling people what their problems were, but working with communities to solve things they raised with us. Politics needs to become more people focused, and I worry that all the candidates see the answers to our current problems in machine politics. Iaposm voting for Rebecca Long-Bailey. Labour MP researcher People are angry at us. Where I work in the North, people want to know why we ignored them, why we doubled down on a man to lead us who was, in their eyes, unfit to lead the country. The public donapost care about aposismsapos and ideologies, they want us to explain how we can fix their lives in a clear way that they can see being implemented. If we donapost stop acting like a seminar on economic theory we deserve to lose every seat we lost to the Tories forever. Iaposm voting for Lisa Nandy. Former staff member for John McDonnell We won arguments around austerity - but couldnapost convince people that we were the best party to implement them. In the face of a mostly hostile media, we did a lot of work in making the radical look like the only reasonable answer. That is because after a decade of austerity, it is. But we sold that down the river by letting people engage in fights about fringe issues of internal party management and not stamping out racism in our movement. Iaposm voting for Rebecca Long-Bailey. Senior Organiser Under Jeremy, Karieand Jennieexperienced staff have been forced from their jobs leaving the party desperately lacking in skills, experience and institutional knowledge at manager and senior manager level. If we are to stand any chance of becoming a competitive party again, we have to fix this. Any new team has to have a clear out of HQ and some regions and bring in people who know how to get the job done. Otherwise, we are doomed to fail before we start.

Northern Ireland will finally see its first same-sex weddings this week after a historic change - six years after gay marriage became legal in the UK. Sharni Edwards and Robyn Peoples will be the first to tie the knot after MPs, sick of a suspended Stormont failing to act, changed the law from Westminster. Yet the fight goes on - as couples in civil partnerships are still in legal limbo. The government is still running a consultation on how to convert their unions into full-blown marriages, or how those who want a religious element to the ceremony should wed. Most of the headlines focus on the politics and the policy. So we spoke to some of the real people behind the news. Whataposs it like to declare your love in a world hemmed in by politics and the law  Here are three of the couples whoaposll be leading the way. Sharni, , and Robyn, : aposWeaposre marrying on Tuesday - and our dresses are the only surprise leftapos  Sharni Edwards, , and Robyn Peoples, , will make history on Tuesday as the first gay couple to get married in Northern Ireland. Six years to the day since they met, the pair will each wear white dresses at a -strong celebration beside the beach in Co Antrim. “That’s the only thing we’ve kept secret from each other, said Robyn. “We haven’t seen each other’s dresses. “I’m going to walk down the aisle first with my mummy and my daddy, then Shani’s going to come in after with her two brothers.”Waitress Sharni, from Brighton, met care assistant Robyn at a gay bar during a week away in her native Belfast. They were inseparable by the end of the week - and spent eight months flying between the two cities every weekend. “We were going ice skating, to the cinema, all that sort of thing, then we realised that was what we wanted to do - to be with each other,” said Robyn. Sharni added: “We were both working full time, Monday to Friday, so every Friday night we would get a flight and be back Sunday night ready for work on the Monday morning.”  The pair moved in together in Brighton but Robyn got homesick for Belfast. Sharni had “no idea” the law was even dferent in Northern Ireland when she moved over. “It wasn’t until I met Robyn that she opened my eyes to reality,” she said. “I thought ‘oh my God, they are so far behind us’. I couldn’t comprehend how we were able to get married in England and they weren’t in Northern Ireland.” But they refused to come to England to get married - eventhat’s where Sharni grew up. Sharni said: “We couldn’t comprehend flying over to England to get married to then fly back and it not even count, or mean anything. “We’re building our lives in Northern Ireland. We want to have a family in Northern Ireland. Our house is in Northern Ireland. “We couldn’t comprehend that we’d have to go to a dferent country to get married.” Robyn said there is “definitely” more prejudice in Northern Ireland - including comments as they hold hands down the street.  But she said: “That’s all down to our politicians. They’re putting fences in front of us which give people the right to discriminate against us.”  She added: “I work with the elderly, so I have people I look after who are  and would ask about Sharni and know she’s my fiancee and have never judge. “So I don’t agree with it being an age thing. It’s in people’s heads, it’s what they’re taught and what they accept that’s their choice. “They don’t have to discriminate against anyone. I have the right to love who I want to love.” Sharni and Robyn never intended to make history - they only got the date because they had booked a civil partnership already.  To their surprise it coincided with the first legal date for marriages in Northern Ireland. So they turned it into a marriage instead. But they won’t have long to celebrate - they’re setting off for their Cyprus honeymoon at am the next day. We didnapost set out to be the first or have all this attention,” said Robyn. “But we are grateful to be able to set the way for the rest of our community. John, , and Martin, : aposWe got a civil partnership - but itaposs not the sameapos  When John OaposDoherty, , met -year-old Martin Toland online six years ago, their first date was in Belfastaposs MAC Theatre. The musical theatre buffs went back to have the photos for their civil partnership - held in Valentineaposs week two years ago. But now John, director of Belfastaposs The Rainbow Project, and Martin, a homeless hostel manager, are stuck in legal limbo because they canapost yet convert their civil partnership. It felt dferent during the ceremony, said John. The language we wanted to hear wasnapost there. We view ourselves as married, we refer to ourselves as husband and husband, and we donapost accept that our relationship is any less than a marriage. When they can finally convert, the pair wonapost be repeating the massive party they had for their civil partnership - it was far too expensive, John jokes. But they will be lining up to convert their status on the very first day it becomes legal. He said: Iaposve been campaigning for eight years, and itaposs wonderful to have been able to achieve the change in the law. But itaposs bittersweet that we have to wait. Itaposs certainly a frustration. John said the long fight for marriage equality has impacted peopleaposs lives and their health. But it means gay people are now more visible - and once youaposre visible, you get acceptance. If you had said to my mum  years ago aposgay men are dangerousapos she might have believed you - she didnapost have any other reference point, he said.

A third replied: Beautul princess Kate, excellent job, wonderful Duchess and Childrenaposs Princess.

Kate met Rhian Costello and her daughter Annabel - who was very excited to meet a real princess.  But was left a tad disappointed as Kate wasnapost wearing a Disney-inspired dress, and Kate ended up apologising to her. Instead of a glitzy gown, Kate opted for a Hobbs coat, Zara dress and an eye-catching Beulah London scarf. Rhian and Annabel waited for the royals at Mumbles pier for an hour, excited to see them. The mum said: My daughter loves fairy tales and Cinderella, and she was really excited to meet a real princess.

If only she knew the terror I felt in that moment of her having to live a le without me in it. I couldn’t pull away from her hug, needed her little arms to stay around my neck forever and ever.

There’s so much we want to do to make it full of happiness, music, dancing - and of course LOVE. I’ve recently made a big decision to have my implants removed. I’ll talk about that in another column but there is a risk of developing lymphoma due to the implants. I don’t remember being informed about any of these risks when I opt for implants - but to be honest, I was heavily pregnant and just , so everything was a bloody big blur.

Forecasters have warned there could be delays or cancellations to air, ferry and train services, damage to buildings and a chance of power cuts caused by wild weather conditions. Storm Ciara was named by the Met Office on Wednesday and is moving eastwards towards the UK and Ireland. Drivers are being warned to take extra care on the roads due to the potential of dficult conditions caused by heavy rain, particularly on coastal or exposed routes. Network Rail and train operators in England issued an alert to passengers, which read: Only travel by train this Sundayabsolutely necessary, with warnings of reduced timetables amid speed restrictions. And a number of airlines including British Airways and easyJet are advising passengers due to fly this weekend to check the status of their flights before heading off due to possible delays. A number of ferry operators have also warned of potential disruption on Saturday and Sunday. CalMac, which runs services in Scotland, says the weather is aposlooking extremely problematic as far as delivering a scheduled timetable while Irish Ferries has said passengers should check timetables for any changes before travelling. Rail disruption could continue into Monday morning as repair work may be hampered by the conditions. Passengers are urged to check for updates before they travel. Strong winds have the potential to damage overhead electric wires and tracks due to debris or trees falling onto the railway.  Yellow warnings of wind have been issued for northwestern parts of the UK on Saturday. On Sunday, a yellow warning of wind covers the entire country, while an amber warning has been issued for south-east England. Met Office chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said: Storm Ciara will bring damaging winds and heavy rain across the UK this weekend and we have issued a range of severe weather warnings giving people time to prepare for potential impacts of the storm. Winds will increase through Saturday across Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England and Wales, before turning very windy across the rest of UK through the early hours of Sunday morning.

The animal, roughly the size of a small dog, is thought to have washed up in Melton Peter Demetre Park, near the US city of Charleston, South Carolina.Photos taken by Erika Constantine while she was walking her dog show that the creature has been almost reduced to bone, the Daily Star reports.“I take my dog, River, there very frequently,” said the -year-old from Jermyn, Pennsylvania. “We were just strolling and she went up to it. “I saw her picking at something with her nose and that’s what made me walk over there because she only does thatsomething is dead, orsomething interesting to her is over there. “I honestly did not know what it was. “It was the size of a small dog but the structure of the whole thing suggests it’s definitely not a dog. “I have lived here for about five years and I have never come across something like this.” Searching for answers about the identity of the beast, Miss Constantine published the photos online and got many dferent answers. “I thought somebody would be like, ‘oh, it’s like a seal’ and then I would go about my day but it stumped a lot of people,” she said. “There are so many theories as to what it is – the cops said it was a possum, it’s definitely not a possum. People were saying it’s a dog, people were saying it’s an iguana.  “Somebody said it was a bobcat which was interesting because they do have similar ribcages.” Other people suggested it could be the mythical chupacabra, a legendary creature that attacks animals and consumes their blood. The dog walker sent her photos to a professor at the College of Charleston hoping to have the mystery creature identied, but she is yet to receive a response. Miss Costantine thinks the creature might come from a secret island overrun by monkeys nearly  miles away. “It’s technically called Morgan Island but it’s nicknamed Monkey Island,” she said. “It’s not inhabited by humans, it’s all monkeys. That’s where all the monkeys that the government tested on live. “I think one of the monkeys from Monkey Island unfortunately might have got swept up in a current, the rip tide or whatever and then it made its way to Charleston.  “It wouldn’t really be the first time, my friend actually found a monkey fossil on the beach a while back, so I think it just kinda got washed up here .“Whenever I go to the beach, I always keep my eyes peeled for something cool because you never know what’s going to wash up.”The monkey population on Morgan Island has grown to nearly , after , specimens were shipped there in , CHStoday reports."},{"url":null,"title":"new images kobe bryant helicopter","story":"NewsNew images of Kobe Bryant helicopter moments before tragic crash releasedInvestigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said low visibility and foggy weather would be a key focus to find out the reasons that have caused the fatal crash after they ruled out engine failureShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror sport other-sports american-sports video last-time-kobe-bryants-helicopter-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news new-images-kobe-bryant-helicopter-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailInvestigators looking into the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna say there is no evidence of a aposcatastrophic internal failureapos. The interim report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board days after the accident also said examination of both rotor assemblies found damage consistent with powered rotation at the time of impact. The preliminary findings pointed to no obvious signs of mechanical problems that may have contributed to the fiery crash on January . New images have been released by the NTSB which show the doomed helicopter moments before the crash that killed everyone on board. The death of Bryant, an -time all-star in the National Basketball Association and one of the worldaposs most admired sports figures, prompted an outpouring of shock and grief from fans and fellow athletes around the globe. The retired Los Angeles Lakers forward had been on his way to a youth basketball tournament in which he was coaching and his daughter and two other girls aboard the luxury chopper were due to compete. The report did not rule out that mechanical issues might yet be identied when the engines and other parts recovered from the wreckage of the Sikorsky S-B are disassembled and more closely examined. NTSB board member Jenner Homendy said two days after the tragedy that clouds, fog and limited visibility reported in the vicinity of the crash would be a key focus of the investigation. Videos and photographs taken by the public in the area depict fog and low clouds obscuring the hilltops around the crash site, including security video footage showing the helicopter disappearing into clouds moments before it went down, according to the report.  The NTSB also quoted a witness from a mountain bike trail in foothills surrounded by mist who recounted briefly glimpsing the helicopter emerging from clouds as it rolled to the left before crashing seconds later a short distance away from him. The pilot, an experienced aviator certied as an instructor, was navigating by visual orientation, not by instrument guidance, during the entirety of the ill-fated flight, the NTSB said. While he was licensed to fly by instruments, the charter company that owned the chopper, Island Express Helicopters, was only permitted to fly by visual flight rules when carrying paying passengers, the report said. Robert Clford, a Chicago-based aviation disaster lawyer, said flying a helicopter in low visibility is ill-advised without two pilots, evennavigating by instruments.  An experienced but nevertheless single pilot in bad weather is a bad formula for the safe operation of a helicopter, he told Reuters. Shortly before radar contact with Bryantaposs helicopter was lost, the pilot had told air traffic control he was trying to climb above a cloud layer, the NTSB said. Moments later the aircraft banked to the left and began to descend, slamming into the ground at more  miles per hourand bursting into flames.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman has claimed stress caused her to develop a condition that left her paralysed from the neck down. Courtney Runyon, , had a busy le of working, travelling and fitness when the disease left her in a nursing home for over three months. The former duct iron pipe manufacturer from Dallas, USA, began to lose feeling in her arms and legs but could not let go of her hectic lestyle. She continued her job in Las Vegas for six months and travelled through dferent states every week for work whilst losing more feeling in her limbs. When doctors in Nevada kept testing her for amyotrophic lateral sclerosisand multiple sclerosiswithout a diagnosis, she decided to see a specialist five hours away in Arizona. At The Mayo Clinic, Courtney received the news that she had chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy , a condition affecting one to eight of every , people. I was telling the Las Vegas doctors, aposyou donapost understand, every day I lt my arms up from my side, I can visibly see myself lting my arm up less and less, Courtney said. It was sort of a relief to be diagnosed with CIDP because at that point it was narrowed down to three neurological-related illnesses. ALS, with which you can die in two to ten years and Lyme disease where itaposs so unpredictable and dficult to put into remission. CIDP was the least severe of the three. CIDP is the chronic form of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Your nerves inflame and your immune system attacks your peripheral nerves which are in your face, arms, legs, throat, internal organs, and skin. One of the more common causes Iaposve heard from others with CIDP is the flu shot or a vaccination, but for me it was triggered by two stressful weeks in December  and I started to show symptoms two weeks later in February of .  One of the first things that I really had problems with was having a shower. I couldnapost lt my hands all the way up to my head so I would bend over to wash my hair but when Iaposd get out, the towel was way too heavy so my ex-boyfriend would have to dry me off. It got to the point where in August , I was going to a wedding in Mexico and I was getting coffee but I couldnapost open my wallet and I couldnapost get my credit card out my friend had to help me and I remember just breaking down crying in the airport. At the wedding dinner I can just remember I couldnapost get the fork up to my mouth. So I would get it on the fork and rest my hand on the table and then I would bend my head down and bite off the fork on the table being held by the weight of my hand.  Two weeks later I went on disability because I couldnapost speak. You had to be right next to me because it sounded like a scratchy whisper. I couldnapost talk to text, and when I was typing on the computer, I would throw my arms up onto the computer because I couldnapost lt them to put them up there and then I was trying to type but then I couldnapost move my wrists and my hands so then I started using my nose. I still thought it was just one of those things I thought would go away and get better, but I would go through all my testing and go on an autoimmune protocol diet for sixty days. I was thinking I was doing everything I needed to do. You just donapost think that you are going to become one of those people that this happens to.  But it came to the point where I was mentally adjusting and realising that I am one of those people and I canapost work. The immune system is thought to cause damage to the myelin sheath of the peripheral nervous system, often affecting the arms and legs first. I couldnapost close my throat all the way so when I drank liquids, I choked on them. They would just leak in my windpipes, she said. What sucked more was I couldnapost flex my stomach to cough it out so I would just be breathing the liquids without being able to cough them out and I couldnapost sneeze either. It was not my best look.  I had lost all my muscle, so the skin between the bone and the bed felt like sticking your finger in a car door. The day after Thanksgiving of , I had to move back to Texas. The nursing home discharged me because I was getting worse and insurance wouldnapost let me stay there anymore. After staying in two hospitals and three nursing homes for a total of  days, Courtney moved back in with parents Renee and Bob in time for Christmas. I went back home and that felt like defeat to the point I was dependent, but I still felt independent. I felt like Iaposd failed Iaposm having to go to live with my parents in full-time care, she said.But once I got there that was exactly where I shouldaposve been for sure my family is amazing they were so supportive, loving and relaxing, I shouldaposve gone there sooner, it was all so wonderful. I love the phrase, aposyou canapost heal in the same environment that made you sickapos. I had to leave Las Vegas - it was crazy there. I quit my job. I loved my ex-boyfriend, but he wasnapost helping at the time. If there are things that are stressing you out, youaposre not going to get well in the way you want to until you get rid of them.  My mother told me her early thirties were her favourite and here I was paralysed from the neck down in my early thirties. When something happens to someone, it is not necessarily the tragedy that makes it sad. Itaposs how that personaposs le was ruined and how the person responds to it that is sad. So, I thought how can I love these years of my le  Instead of going to physical therapy twice a week how about I go to a yoga and physical therapy retreat by the beach  Sometimes when I was in the hospital when I got uncomfortable like hair in my face that I couldnapost move, I would close my eyes and picture myself on a beach in a red dress.So, my friends threw me a surprise party after hospital and got me that red dress I always pictured so I could do that. I was just really trying to put focus on what I could do now that I couldnapost before. Which is why I filmed myself in the hospital in a wheelchair wearing fun costumes or why I went travelling even though I had to ask strangers to tie up my hair.

Alan Steele, from Wolverhampton, was moved to hospital on Friday while his we Wendy Marshall Steele remained trapped on board the Diamond Princess at a port in Yokohama, Japan. Mrs Marshall Steele, , said on Saturday her husband told her he will be retested in  hours andhe tests negative twice he will be released. Mr Steele, , revealed he is in an isolation room and he has become the hospitalaposs lab rat while undergoing tests and observation, leaving his doctor confused because he has shown no symptoms so far. Are you on board the ship  Email webnews@mirror. The ship has been isolated with  people having been taken to hospitals after testing positive for the SARS-like virus. Mr Steele wrote on Facebook message posted at about am local time on Saturday: I am in a isolation room and have become their lab rat as doctor confused as I have no symptoms and tests all say I am healthy apart from having virus. His we, who has not tested positive for the virus, wrote later: Just spoken to Alan. He will be retested in hrs. If he passes the test twice then he can go. Question is where  He canapost come back on ship, so who knows when we will get to see each other or which country.  Mrs Marshall Steele, a nurse, and the rest of the , passengers and crew are in a -day quarantine and will not be allowed to disembark until February  at the earliest. In an earlier post, she wrote: It was a hard first night without Alan. But hey. We are constantly in touch. Japanese doctors are excellent and he is in safe hands. Thank you all again. Mrs Marshall Steele said she was also well but had cabin fever as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship, where she will turn  on Tuesday. The newlyweds were due to fly back to Britain this week so Mr Steele could start a new job as a driver on Monday.  They had spent days confined to their cabin before Mr Steele tested positive for the flu-like virus, which has killed more than  people in China, where the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan in December. The ship was put in quarantine on Monday after an -year-old Hong Kong man, who disembarked the ship last month, was diagnosed, A total of  British passport holders - including crew - were among those who boarded the ship. David Abel, a friend of Mr Steele who is also a passenger on the ship, said Wendy is missing her husband a great deal but said they are in regular contact.  He told BBC Breakfast: Alanaposs been in touch with me a couple of times today. If all goes well, heaposs being tested again in a couple of daysapos time, andhe is clear they will test him again  hours later andhe still remains clear he will be released from the hospital. But whereaposs he going to go  He will not be allowed back on board the ship. Mr Abel said he thinks the process of quarantining is essentially important, but added: I wish the UK government would send out a ship or a huge plane and bring us to the UK. I would far sooner be in the UK under a better controlled environment than being on board the ship, to tell you the truth.  The shipaposs operator, Princess Cruises, said the vesselaposs quarantine was due to end on February , barring unforeseen developments, and confirmed all affected guests were being taken to hospitals. Passengers now have access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access. Meanwhile, five members of a British family have tested positive for coronavirus during a holiday in the French Alps. They were infected by a relative who caught the bug in Singapore between January  and  and then met them at a chalet in Contamines-Montjoie, where he stayed for four days before ing to the UK. That man was the first UK national to contract the disease.  The man is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and was transferred to St Thomasapos Hospital in London, where there is an infectious diseases unit, on Thursday afternoon. Two other patients, who had recently travelled from China, are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle. One is a student at the University of York, while the other is a family member.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gary-and-Piacquiao-940x531.jpg ","title":"boxing fanatic gary todd describes brushes with the biggest stars in the sport since move from st marys to sydney","story":"Interviewing Muhammad Ali, having lunch with Manny Pacquiao and tracking down Deontay Wilder # it#s all in a day#s work for Dundee-born Gary Todd.Growing up in St Mary#s, Gary never would have imagined that one day he#d get the chance to meet boxing legends such as Mike Tyson and Julio César Chávez, however after moving to Sydney in  his le changed completely.The former Rockwell High School pupil now has two international bestselling books on the sport of boxing, and has had the chance to travel to countries such as Japan, Canada, the Bahamas, Hong Kong and the USA.He said: #I grew up in St Mary#s andI#m honest I didn#t go to school a lot.#I went to MacAlpine Primary School and I was at Rockwell for a year, but I dropped out to start working and earning some money.#I got a job at the slaughterhouse, but after a while I felt like I couldn#t see a future for myself in Dundee, so I decided to do a bit of travelling.#I went to Australia on a visa and loved it so much I decided to stay.#My we Jenny came with me and we got married and started a family here.#The boxing fanatic decided to join a local gym near his new home in Sydney, and soon found himself interviewing some of boxing#s greatest legends for a book on all the dferent workouts used in the sport.He said: #I#ve always been passionate about the sport, so I joined the gym.#I started training there and I made some connections and pals, then I kind of slipped into writing my book.#Throughout the course of writing his workout book, Gary has travelled across the globe, getting interviews and pictures with over  boxing champions.However, it hasn#t all been a walk in the park for the father of three.He said: #One time, a bodyguard threatened to shoot me.#I was talking to Marvin Hagler, who#s actually my favourite boxer of all time.#His bodyguard was annoying me and getting in the way and we started arguing.#He threatened to take me outside and shoot me, and Marvin Hagler just had to stand between us.#Gary, whose day job is as a director at a construction company in Australia, has gained a large amount of fame and respect in the boxing community for his work.He has produced two books, Workouts from Boxing#s Greatest Champs Volume  and , which have been popular among fans of the sport.The -year-old has been invited to watch Deontay Wilder#s fight against Tyson Fury later this month in Nevada, and plans to continue his work interviewing the biggest names in the sport.He said: #I#m a family man, I#m a construction worker, and I#ve got a passion in le which is boxing.#I#ve been into it since I was  years old, when the first Rocky film came out in cinemas.#It took me around  years to finish my first book, and I went all over the world.#I saved up my money and frequent flyer miles, flying all over the world economy class.#In two weeks, I#m planning to fly to Las Vegas to watch the Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder fight as part a member on a press accreditation.#He also confessed that his thick Dundonian accent does present a bit of a challenge at times, saying: #I do get some comments on it.

competitions and an event arena for any clubs to demonstrate their skills or competitions to be staged.There will also be hot food vans, a fun run and k run, a parade to open the main event led by the gala prince and princesses, a raft race at the Rohaan cafe and a football tournament.And there are plans for an awards ceremony, with prizes and accolades to be handed out by the gala princess.Shelly

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

find enough like-minded left-leaning allies to form a workable government.Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, both centre-right in outlook, have unequivocally ruled out any partnership with Sinn Fein, and for

I knew the importance of being part of a union, both for my own inidual rights and for the strong collective message it sent. That low-level hum of sexism has followed me through the movement, though. Working on a book about trade unions, Irsquove lost count of the number of times men have tried to lecture me about its history or sent me unsolicited emails with advice on how to approach the subject.Thatrsquos why it was gratying news this week that the Scottish Trades Union Congress will welcome its first woman General Secretary later this year when Grahame Smith retires. When Roz Foyer, a Unite stalwart, steps up to become the most senior representative for Scotlandrsquos , trade union members, it will also mark the first time that all trade union centres in the UK and Ireland will be led by women. Considering that women make up more than half of the UKrsquos trade union membership, itrsquos about time too.Despite the key role that women have played in labour struggles throughout history, the union movement was constructed in the model of men it was men who designed and built it, men who led it, and men who it catered to as default, with the standard worker often envisaged as a white male manual labourer. Ironically, while men ploughed on with making the union movement in their mould, women were often busy fighting their own workplace struggles for equal pay and equal recognition on the sidelines.This account of the origins of the trade union movement isnrsquot just subjective analysis, it is fact: addressing the TUC in , parliamentary secretary Henry Broadhurst called for Congress to ldquobring about a condition where wives and daughters would be in their proper sphere at home, instead of being dragged into competition for livelihood against the great and strong men of the world. More than  years later in , when women workers at the Plessey electrics plant in Bathgate proposed industrial action to resist its closure, male trade unionists blocked them in a vote.The trade union movement remains more essential than ever in this time of accelerated inequality and the plummeting standards at work, and many parts of it have worked hard to shake off a reputation as a working class old boysrsquo network but its history still casts many a shadow, in ways both subtle and brazen. Just two years ago, Glasgowrsquos majority-female council workers found themselves making history when they took strike action over historic pay inequalities and won. But it took the persistence of women workers who knew their worth and a new generation of female organisers to right a historic wrong set in motion by the unions themselves alongside a Labour-run council which didnrsquot even pretend to prioritise the interests of working-class women.Installing women in leadership positions, welcome as it is, is no silver bullet for tackling these structural and ingrained barriers for women in the union movement. While Foyerrsquos record as an avowed feminist is reassuring for women workers across Scotland, the challenge of transforming an entire movement is not hers to bear alone, and nor should it be in a project built on the ideals of collectivism and building power from the bottom up.But an STUC leadership that prioritises equalities and building power amongst women workers at community and branch level has the potential to be transformative, both for womenrsquos inidual lives and for the movement as a whole. After all,trade unions are to survive andto their former glory, they have no choice but to adapt to todayrsquos employment landscape, where a growing number of women face greater challenges than ever.When the union movement was at its peak in the s, it was in part because it recognised the dominance of industry and sought to organise manual labourers accordingly. But unions remain strong amongst those industries while the industries themselves dwindle alongside rapid deindustrialisation. Meanwhile, service and care sectors where women are more likely to be concentrated have expanded rapidly but remain largely unorganised, despite the plethora of problems encountered there, ranging from pay inequalities to insecure and casual work arrangements, health and safety and poverty wages.A feminist trade union movement would take seriously the challenge of organising these workplaces, engaging not only with current union members but with those not yet signed up ndash tackling head on a tension which has always existed for the movement. It would seek to build women activists at grassroots levels and elect them as leaders at branch and regional levels. It would prioritise pay equality, and maternity and discrimination rights, evenit made some male members uncomfortable or put some noses out of joint. And it would listen to the voices of all women, and minorities, and not just those who have traditionally been most represented.The trade union movement isnrsquot perfect, but it is vital. Itrsquos also changing, with recent campaigns around womenrsquos representation in the movement and new grassroots unions like United Voices of the World organising workers in the gender-based violence and charity sectors for the first time. And in Scotland, Glasgowrsquos equal pay women have created a watershed moment for female council workers across the UK, many of whom have long been exploited and are now making their voices heard for the first time. The opportunities are plentulthe movement chooses to take them.Andfresh leadership leads to a bold and radical agenda, and the building up of new generations of female trade unionists, the future could be bright for Scotlandrsquos women workers."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-its-five-minutes-walk-run","story":"THIS week a metal detecting enthusiast discovered treasure in the grounds of Trefoil House near Hermiston, Edinburgh.

The shambles surrounding two new ferries to serve Arran and the Hebrides now has the Scottish taxpayer on the hook for at least pound million, in what is merely the latest example of an embarrassing and costly public project that has run aground.Ferguson Marine, which won the contract in  and went under last year with debts of pound million before being taken into public ownership, blames the Scottish Government and CMAL, another state-owned company that owns the ferries run by CalMac. CMAL claims that Ferguson began work before agreeing final specications, and that cost overruns were its responsibility.Meanwhile, CalMac says that it never wanted dual fuel vessels, using marine diesel and liquefied natural gas , and Jim McColl, the industrialist who took on Fergusonrsquos in , says the system would never have provided a benefit.The Scottish Government stands accused of having insisted on LNG as a green gimmick, and of prematurely announcing the order to steal a march on a Tory spending commitment at Faslane, made on the same day by the then Chancellor, George Osborne.If, as the Scottish Governmentrsquos former adviser Luke van Beek suggests, there was a breakdown in communication, and that the brief for the project was dangerously vague, it can certainly be charged with having failed to provide adequate scrutiny of how public money was being spent, and to have stepped in to prevent matters becoming worse.After the fiascos at ScotRail and the hospital builds in Glasgow, Edinburgh and now Aberdeen, this is becoming a dismally familiar complaint. The latest mess ndash which holds up to ridicule both our proud shipbuilding heritage and the basic competence of Holyrood ndash is a particular embarrassment, and demands an urgent public inquiry. This, too, is a depressingly familiar call.Ministers have been far too ready to make excuses, dodge responsibility and ndash always a favoured tactic ndash accuse critics of ldquotalking Scotland down. If the SNP wishes to demonstrate that independence is a credible political option , it needs to begin operating with the basic level of competence citizens expect and deserve.The greatest service the SNP could perform for the nationalist cause is not to attempt to rerun the last referendum, nor to manufacture grievances to lob at Westminster, but to give the electorate evidence that politicians at Holyrood are capable of performing the tasks fundamental to government.That means upholding standards in public services, demonstrating responsible stewardship of the taxpayersrsquo money, ensuring infrastructure projects deliver the intended result and provide value for money and, above all, accepting that the responsibility for failure ultimately rests with ministers.Examples such as Crossrail and HS demonstrate that such failings are not unique to Scotland they are a perpetual risk in all government spending. But that is why the public is entitled to expect ministers to be vigilant against waste, delay and a failure to deliver. Scotlandrsquos record is undeniably poor.The Government at Holyrood is gaining an unfortunate reputation for expensive failures of this sort. Their apparent casual disregard for their basic duties, and for what the Scottish people have a right to expect, is a disservice to Scotland as a competent and capable nation which can attend to its own affairs. That,nothing , should alarm the SNP, since it is an indictment not only of the competence of their current administration, but of their fundamental ambition."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"DEREK Mackay isnrsquot the only Nat posting appalling material on social media.

History, music and crafting were of greater interest in lower and middle income groups, while sports and food were more popular in higher incomes groups. Natural heritage, theatre and drama and growing and gardening were equally popular among all income groups.The reported benefits of cultural participation include socialising and making friends, making localitiesbetter places to live and visit, increased health and wellbeing, education and learning, and building stronger local communities.Respondents from the Highlandsand Islands rated above the national average for all benefits, while people from the north east were also above average.People living in the west of the country had above average results for the role of culture in strengthening local communities, and for making better places to live and work.By contrast, residents in the south were below average for the perceived benefits, including stronger local communities, learning new skills and increased physical activity.When asked what form of cultural activity people would most like to see developed in their local area, film and TV dropped from the top spot, with greater priority given to nature and natural places, growing and gardening, and architecture and built heritagendash suggesting these were areas people would like to see better provided for in their own areas in the future.The National Trust for Scotlandsees the forthcoming culture strategyas a way for the country as a whole to increase opportunities to enjoy its culture and believes an expansive definition of culture must be adopted it to be relevant to the experience of most people.Diarmid Hearns, the Trustrsquos head of public policy, said: ldquoIn its new strategy, the Scottish Government has a real opportunity to show leadership on this, tackling the barriers we have identied and enabling participation from all in the community, across the country.ldquoOur research found Scots see many additional benefits from their cultural activities, including learning, making friends, or creating a better place tolive.

But letrsquos agree on one thing: socialism is on the march in America. For now, the White House remains a distant destination. But the Left is on the road that leads to it and is starting to make some progress.Remember what leading Marxist moderate Mao Tse Tung once said: ldquoA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, which I guess is true, evenhe later took the bus. Apart from which, it was the Taoist philosopher Lao Tzu who said it first. He also favoured small government, which Mao misread as ldquohuge government.And government of some size is what socialist presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders wants in America. Hersquos calling for ldquodemocratic socialism, something we never thought would ever get a hearing in the world HQ of capitalism.Beyond such moderate measures, Berniersquos more extreme grassroots supporters speak of ldquorevolution, and theyrsquore not using it in the mild sense. They mean in the Bolshevik sense. And, beyond Berniersquos ldquodemocratic socialists, a further left has developed that waves hammer and sickle flags and wants the full communist monty. Theyrsquore like something out of Britain in the s.Even mainstream Bernie supporters at meetings chant: ldquoWe have nothing to lose but our chains. The words were originally those of Karl Marx, though as with Lao Tzu therersquos a school of thought that he was mistranslated and that ldquochains should have read ldquoreading glasses.Berniersquos mainstream campaign, however, focuses on ldquoworking class people and the young. Bernie is ldquofor the people. His Democratic rivals for the partyrsquos presidential candidacy are ldquofor the moneyed people.The pitch appears to be working. The first caucus in Iowa saw Bernie lose by a mere . per cent to Pete Buttigieg , and hersquos also polling well in New Hampshire, which votes on Tuesday.For my part, much though I admire bits of Bernie, Irsquom not wholly convinced by him. That could be down to personal prejudice. During the impeachment show-trial of President Trump, he sat repeatedly dabbing at his beak with Kleenex, a practice that I cannot abide. Just as Irsquod never date one of these woman who keeps a paper hankie up beside the wrist-cuff of their pullover ndash disgusting! ndash I could never vote for such a man.However, perhaps thatrsquos just me. Many voters in America are clearly more tolerant, or less principled, which has led to senior establishment Democrats being ldquoscared to death that they could be going down the road first tarmacked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over here.In other words, for all the grassroots hullabaloo, Bernie will get trounced by Trump, just as Jeremy was by BoJo. In truth, I canrsquot see socialism getting a real snf of power any time soon in America. Apart from anything , as over here, it carries the albatross of liberalism rounds its neck, with the same woke insanity, Pelosi-style gimmicks, and manipulative legalistic attempts to subvert democracy.That said, itrsquos a mystery why America has never had a socialist movement until now. It had early martyrs and a strong trade union culture, but the whole gun-totinrsquo, ldquoeveryone can make it schtick remains deep-rooted in the popular psyche. And they seem to have a penchant for that peculiar old concept that they see as incompatible with socialism: freedom.Red flag over the White House  Never going to fly, Irsquom afraid. At least not for some time to come.+++SHOULDERGATE gripped the nation this week, after Labour culture spokeswoman Tracy Brabin flashed flesh from the controversial clavicle area of her body in the House of Commons chamber.As so often, the nation was bitterly ided over the issue. Traditionalists, and others people who uphold decency, thought the former Coronation Street starrsquos frock ndashthat is the word ndash was inappropriate wear in such a sombre sanctum of deliberation and waffle.Feminists, however, said she should be able to flash as much flesh as she wanted, but hell mend anyone who looks at it. They dressed the issue up, so to say, as ldquowomenrsquos right to blah-blah, which pretty much equates to the way a sulky teenager will say: ldquoDo what I want.At any rate, it was all good publicity for the frock-makers under advisement, as the pound garment has since flown off the shelves at online retailer ASOS.At the time of going to press, it remains a mystery why the same phenomenon has not followed the controversial wearing of double-breasted, pinstriped suits by top Tory toff, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Although a role model for many young men today, his sartorial tastes remain distinctly niche and unavailable at many fashion outlets.++++THE impressive taking out by police of a terrorist kneman in Streatham, London, has been applauded by all right-minded people. However, not everyone is in their right mind.Soon, the usual jaw-dropping allegations of ldquoIslamophobia and the shooting being ldquotoo extreme appeared online.What are people making such claims, readers  Correct: these people are nutters. I was going to say you could probably even find some complaining that the cops were white males, but I see now that you can take out the ldquoprobably. Jeez.However, one deeply disturbing aspect of the incident that has received little attention was the attire of the plain-clothes counter-terrorism officers. They were wearing hellip hoodies!Is a terrorist attack a legitimate excuse to lower sartorial standards like this  You could argue the habiliments were practical, providing a disguise by which the officers passed themselves of as being as slovenly as the average British citizen.But thatrsquos not how matters were dealt with by Colin Firth in Kingsman, where the undercover agent rendered himself inconspicuous by wearing a well-tailored, pinstriped suit and a pair of highly polished Oxford shoes.We trust the officers involved in the Streatham incident received a dressing down on ing to base.++++IN an arguably controversial move, a co-founder of mental environmental group Extinction Rebellionhas called for civilisation to be ldquotaken down and for humanity toto a ldquoferal state of consciousness.Simon Bramwell, speaking at an event headed ldquoBy Any Means Necessary, urged activists to ldquosabotage civilisation in order to save the planet. Sounds like a plan. But not a good one.Jolly Mr B added: ldquoExtinction Rebellion is the spirit of our age. It contains every dichotomy and absolutely every flaw and beauty that our present society encapsulates.Expanding on this, he went on, tongue in cheek we trust, to speak of XR being ldquowhite-supremacist, ldquoracist and ldquodeeply patriarchal, meaning ndash I think ndash that it was a broad church containing all sorts of nutters.Later, XR issued an official statement saying the movement was indeed a broad church ndash ldquoincluding lawyers, doctors, electricians, nurses, farmers, teachers and other hooligans ndash and adding that Simonrsquos views didnrsquot represent ldquothe position of Extinction Rebellion as a whole.Schism!

A lelong politician is not the right skills for this particular position.If we are to create an economy that funds our ambitions in the NHS, social care, police, infrastructure and climate change we need someone who has experience of managing the economy, not another political apparatchik.Ian McNair, Glasgow G.THE Scottish Government claims that its reason for demanding details from the Sun was to establish veracity and substance. A reality is that it had a readily accessible source of verication and substantiation in the shape of Derek Mackay.I might be a bit naiumlve but, regardless of the name and address of a -year-old, the question is whether a minister behaved inappropriately. Prior to the Scottish Government making the demand, Mr Mackay was in a position to very and substantiate whether such messages had been sent.The above aside, we dont know yet whether the First Minister asked two obvious questions before it approached the newspaper. The first of those questions is \"Did you do it \"If Mr Mackay denied it and this was why the Scottish Government sought evidence we now know that his denial would have been a lie. If he didnt lie then the FM was obliged to ask the next question, which would have been along the lines of \"Is this the only one \"Yesterday, the FM denied knowledge of any other instance. As a result, one of two things must be true. The first might be that the FM lied at Holyrood. The second is that she didnt ask the question. The first would be a bare-faced lie uttered by someone in high office. If she did not ask Mr Mackayhe had done this sort of thing before, we are left with a First Minister who is unable to bring an obvious question to mind in a crisis. The alternative would be that she chose not to ask in a hopeless effort to claim plausible deniability.Many of us wonderthis Governments first actions will always be to protect itself and the cause it promotes rather than protect the people of Scotland from the excesses of those who work within it and who are leading lights in that cause.Kenny Wilson, Greenock.DEREK Mackay should do the honourable thing now and resign as an MSP. His shameful conduct has no place in any decent society.The scandal involving Mr MacKay may only be the beginning of an intensely dficult period for the First Minister and for the Scottish Government with the highly publicised trial of Alex Salmond taking place next month and the ongoing debate over Indyref causing internal ision and doubt. However, followers of Scottish independence must look beyond personalities and media sensationalism during this thorny time to reassure themselves that their quest for self-determination rises above human failings and parochial party politics.It is important to keep a clear vision of what kind of country we wish to live in at this time when we are creeping towards the Brexit abyss and are ruled from Westminster by a Government that regards Scotland as a colony and those who represent us with a mixture of ambivalence and disdain. The quest for a land where social equality and justice, together with a stable economy wherein fair distribution of wealth is a priority, is eminently achievable within a Scotland, that through the EU or even EFTA, finds itself again part of a European family of nations. The very heart of the UK continues to decay from within thanks to the perpetual class system, self-interest of the economic elite and the archaic political system.We must look beyond the current travails of the Scottish Government and keep our eyes on the prize. Independence for Scotland is no longer a pipe dream, it is almost within our grasp.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHY does Allan Fitzpatrick bother doubting the ability of the SNP to govern competently in an independent Scotland  Has he not yet realised that the whole point of independence is that we will have the government we choose, which means that he, like everyone , will have a choice of parties to vote for to run the government  Who is to say that the SNP will still exist, at least in its present form  Many of its current members who want independence will probably revert to parties with which they formerly had affinity and the SNP therefore will either disband or develop into a dferent party.What matters is Scotlandrsquos ability to run its own affairs efficiently under a government of our own choice.P Davidson, Falkirk.IrsquoM in no way shocked at the behaviour of some senior SNP politicians. But yet at every election the SNP portrays itself as an exemplar of upstanding behaviour, in direct contrast with the den of inequity at Westminster. It seems to think Holyrood is new, post-modern, a gleaming city on the hill. Westminster is colonial, stuck in the th century, sleazy, its politicians reflecting this.The numerous recent and past events demonstrate that SNP politicians are all too human. As prone to stupidity, misconduct, aice, licentious and pettiness as any other group of people that have ever existed.Perhaps the SNP and its supporters could stop pretending that their politicians are somehow scandal-free colossi sent down from Arthurrsquos Seat. Scandals will come and go. Hypocrisy tends to last longer.David Bone, Girvan.IAN Thomsoninvokes McMillanrsquos ldquoevents, dear boy comment. I think the more appropriate classical reference is Icarus. The SNP and its leaders have sailed too close to the ldquoSun for too long as they have stupidly attempted to break away from their Crete.Just as Icarus before, hubris has got them all in the end. Their dream is over.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

We sought to understand, in relation to culture, what is important to people, what is working well, what changes are needed, and what kind of future they would like to see.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: We would like to again assure the public that plans are in place to deal with a positive test for coronavirus in Northern Ireland when it occurs. It is also inevitable that a number of people will continue to be tested on a precautionary basis in the weeks ahead and it is important to keep these tests in perspective. A test does not mean that a positive result is expected or likely. As of February , a total of  tests were concluded across the UK, of which  were confirmed negative and three positive.Dferent precautionary measures are taken as part of the testing protocols. This can include protective clothing for health and social care staff - for their protection and protection of the wider public.

Over the decade-and-a-half, the industrial and shipbuilding legacy that once dominated the space within the city centre has gradually been stripped away, as commercial and tourism industries shape the planning and development of Belfast.While some of the most dramatic changes over the years have been the development of the docks in the city, there have also been signicant alterations to the Cathedral Quarter, Victoria Square and the Ulster University site among others.Clare Mulholland is a professor at the Queen#s University School of Natural and Built Environment. She explained that the pace of change in such a short period of time can be traced to a number of factors including the de-industrialisation of the city and the legacy of the Troubles.Since the Good Friday Agreement and in the last  to  years there has been huge changes in the city, but obviously the urban environment particularly, she explained.The city centre has become a shared space. The best comparison for the development of Belfast would maybe best be to somewhere like Sheffield and Bristol.Ours was more pronounced though because it was people fleeing the city and living where. The urban environment of Belfast changed because of the Troubles.The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter changed what was previously a very local area into a vibrant part of the city.What can happen with those larger scale developments is that they have great potential to act as a catalyst in the community.While bright new buildings and hotels have popped up, Professor Mulholland does strike a cautionary note about the importance of adequate connection and ensuring Belfast meets future challenges, particularly around climate change. Going forward, she believes we should have an eye on how to ensure the city is sustainable.It depends on careful city planning to make sure the infrastructure is there, she added. There has to be a focus on building a connected city. One that is accessible, particularly by walking and cycling routes.One thing which could be really exciting for Belfast is Stormont declaring a climate emergency, which creates a focus on what is good for this city.I am a big believer that Belfast could be one of the most beautul cities in the world. It is a really beautul size in terms of everything being in walking distance. It has that potential to harness.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsBelfast schoolboy in serious condition in hospital after being struck by carGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsNorthern Ireland braced for wild weekend of wind and rain with snow next week as Met Office ups weather warnings,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When something is so integral to yourself, that was very dficult, he said.You have a constant internal dialogue and you hope it will change and then you find out that you just have to live with it. I didn#t know anybody who was gay at that stage. It is a very isolated situation to be in.Meeting his future we at University of Ulster when the pair were students at the age of , the couple eventually had one son. Mr Creelan also forged a career within the RUC and PSNI, eventually reaching the rank of inspector, before his retirement a number of years ago.Mr Creelan explained that it was the death of close gay friend in the force, Constable Darren Bradshaw, who was murdered in May , which prompted him to announce his inner feelings to his family.I guess it was in . I was in the police at that stage. For me I had wanted to do it for a long time, but it was the death of Darren and having to deal with that professionally that prompted me, he said.I was talking to my we about him and his death and that#s when we dealt with things.Her family reacted really badly at the time. We were still living together and trying to make things work. Once her family had found out, that became impossible. I was already not involved with my own family.You think you can make it work and when we separated our friends didn#t know why. I suppose I thought maybe she might know, but she had no idea whatsoever. It was a very brutal discovery.He added: When it happened, I had a very negative reaction and so it cost a lot in terms of friends and family at the time. With me, nothing had been going on other than what was in my head. My son would have been about nine at that time.My we and I had - child care and eventually when he was ready and wanted to ask the questions, he was told what the situation was.As a parent I didn#t change. Just as I took being married seriously, I took the job of being a parent seriously.From the dficult days of the past, Vincent now celebrates the immensely positive relationship he has with his son and grandson.I am in the very privileged position of being gay and being a parent and grandfather. I have a really great le with my partner, he said.I had a great career and I have a lovely family. As a -year-old now, the journey I have had the past  years is amazing. I am lucky I have a son who is  now and is one of my best friends. I look after my grandson very regularly.In that regard I am a firm believer that le gets better when you come out.Giving his reaction to ITV host Schofield public announcement on Friday, the Newtownards man said the support shown to Mr Schofield could shine a light for others.He has obviously been having those discussions with his family, which is a mature thing to do, he added.I do think he is in a great position to really say that this is a good, positive thing.

vote in irish general election","story":"President Michael D Higgins and his we Sabina Coyne  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPresident Michael D Higgins and his we Sabina Coyne By David Young and Aine McMahon, PAFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIreland’s President has cast his vote in the country’s General Election.Michael D Higgins was accompanied by his we Sabina Higgins to vote at a polling station in St Mary’s Hospital in Dublin.The president greeted the assembled count staff and press and said he was glad the weather had remained sunny, despite reports of a storm.In Cork, Micheal Martin, the leader of main opposition party Fianna Fail, voted at his local polling station in Ballinlough with his we, daughter and two sons early on Saturday morning.Voting began at am in what is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable elections in years.On a day when Storm Ciara threatens to dampen turnout, the country is having its first Saturday General Election for more than a century.If opinion polls prove correct, Sinn Fein is on course to challenge the -year duopoly of the state’s two main parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is facing a dficult battle to hang on to power, with recent polls putting his party in third place.In the last major survey of the electorate before polling day, Sinn Fein was leading the popularity stakes on %, with Fianna Fail second on % and Mr Varadkar’s party on %.If those levels of support are borne out when the counting of votes begins on Sunday, it would herald a major breakthrough for Sinn Fein south of the border.However, the odds would still be stacked against party leader Mary Lou McDonald leading the next government as Taoiseach.Its polling performance has far surpassed the expectations of party strategists who, coming off the back of several disappointing elections, only fielded  candidates in the race for the Dail parliament’s  seats. vw,vw,px, px\"Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin and family leave after voting at St Anthony’s Boys National School in Ballinlough, Cork That means evenSinn Fein had a perfect day and won all  seats – an extremely unlikely outcome in itself – it would still end up well short of a majority.No party is expected to reach the -seat threshold to enable it to govern on its own, and a coalition administration of some complexion is almost inevitable.But Sinn Fein is in a slightly dferent position to its two main rivals, as it may be unable to find enough like-minded left-leaning allies to form a workable government.Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, both centre-right in outlook, have unequivocally ruled out any partnership with Sinn Fein, and for either to change position would represent a major U-turn.If it is unable to strike an alliance with either of the other two main parties, Sinn Fein would be unlikely to secure a place in the next government. vw,vw,px, px\"Voting is under way across Ireland Fianna Fail topped the opinion polls early in the campaign, and leader Mr Martin could yet emerge as Ireland’s next Taoiseach.Mr Varadkar, meanwhile, will be hoping his administration’s economic record and handling of the Brexit process will convince enough voters to renew his tenure in Government Buildings in Dublin.However, Brexit did not feature prominently in a campaign that was instead dominated by domestic issues such as spiralling rental prices, record-breaking homeless numbers, controversy over the state pension age and a struggling health service.There appears to be a mood for change and Sinn Fein could attract support from younger voters who want to end Fine Gael’s nine years in power but are unwilling to trust Fianna Fail again after the financial crash that marked its last term of office. vw,vw,px, px\"Leo Varadkar faces a tough battle to hang onto power Faced with the Sinn Fein surge, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have been keen to remind the electorate of the party’s historic IRA links and, as the campaign entered its latter stages, the past crimes of the provisional movement drew increasing focus.Mr Varadkar’s last government – a minority administration that included several independent TDs – was sustained in power through a historic confidence and supply arrangement with Fianna Fail.That landmark pact between two parties founded from opposing sides of Ireland’s civil war of the s took  days to negotiate following the inconclusive  General Election.Ireland could be in for more protracted government-formation talksthis election produces another fractured result.The willingness of smaller parties such as Labour and the Greens to become a junior coalition partner could prove critical.A new confidence and supply deal cannot be ruled out – potentially a reverse of the last one, with Fine Gael supporting a Fianna Fail led-minority.A strong result for Sinn Fein could even force Ireland’s two traditional political superpowers to contemplate the once unthinkable – a grand coalition in government together.PARelated Content and Pat Breen , holding his grandaughterAoibhin Breen\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ca .ece AUTOCROP wh

The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, presented at the emergency department around am on Friday, January . She told the Derry News she had to wait until pm the following evening before she seen her GP and a decision was made to admit her to a mental health unit in Omagh. Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, the woman who is in her s, has complex needs and has active suicidal ideation. She claims the community psychiatric nurse at Altnagelvin was sending her home until a police officer intervened to insist that she got the help she needed. googletag.cmd.push According to the latest figures available for the Western Trust area,  people are waiting to access to Children and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesservices. The target is that no patient waits more than nine weeks, but  of those iniduals have been waiting in excess of nine weeks, with the longest wait forty-one weeks. In addition, , people are waiting to access psychological therapies. No patient is supposed to wait longer than thirteen weeks, however,  have done so - the longest wait recorded  weeks. It was recently announced that the Stormont executive is to set up a new working group on mental wellbeing and resilience. googletag.cmd.push It is the first time that the executive has collectively demonstrated determination and unity to tackle mental health issues including suicide. Health minister Robin Swann said the issue requires a strategic, coordinated and sustained approach across government departments. Interventions A Spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trustsaid: “Respecting confidentiality the Western Trust does not comment on the inidual treatment and care of its patients. “Those presenting in crisis to an Emergency Department will be seen within two hours by a mental health professional and will have a thorough mental state assessment. This service operates seven days per week across the Trust. “In addition the Trust also operates the Card Before You Leave scheme . This scheme offers next day appointments with a mental health professional for those presenting with a mental health crisis who have been assessed as being low risk of self-harm.” She continued: “Following assessment patients may be offered a range of interventions including admission,appropriate, to a psychiatric bed, referred for follow-up by an appropriate community mental health team, referred to an appropriate community or voluntary organization or discharged back to the care of their General Practitioner. “There are a range of statutory and voluntary services which respond to those with mental health issues in the Western Trust area. “Services in the voluntary sector can be accessed through self-referral or through referral from mental health services, acute services or Emergency Departments. Statutory services are accessed via GP and or Emergency Department referral.”  Crisis intervention service No decision has yet been made on the future of Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Service based at the Holywell Trust building on Bishop Street. In its first year the de-escalation service helped over  people in ying degrees of crisis, including those at risk of suicide or self-harm. Service Co-ordinator, Joe Thompson, wholeheartedly believes it has been le saving in that time. However, funding is not in place to ensure the long-term future of the service. Yesterday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that the University of Ulster has carried out an evaluation of the pilot Community Crisis Intervention Servicewhich will help inform statutory health partners on future service provision within the council area. The Health and Social Care Board are also considering a request from Council for funding to allow the pilot CCIS to continue to the end of March . Mark H. Durkan MLA tabled a question to the Department of Health regarding its commitment to the continuation of the Community Crisis Intervention Service in Derry. In response this week, a DoH official said: “The Crisis Intervention Service in Derry is led by Derry and Strabane District Council. “The Health and Social Care Board are currently considering a request for funding from the council to allow the project to continue until the end of March .

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Christmasaurus by Tom Fletcher was a quirky read about a Christmas dinosaur and we both chuckled at the last line from lead character William Trundle. Itll not be long until well be penning the next Santa letter and on the journey home from Newry on Saturday night, I began to think how I would word mine. Dear Santa, can you bring me a long term plan that will provide high fetching midfielders to Derry. I have talked about it many times but now I am writing to you looking for something I think we really need and would get long term joy from. Signed, Sideline View. googletag.cmd.push I have said it over and over. There is no substitute for big mobile men in the games engine room. The systematic method of securing primary possession from short and strategic kick-outs is a brilliant development. I think back to watching Rory Beggan for Scotstown against Slaughtneil in Clones. Sitting behind Stephen Cluxton in Croke Park one day. The movement that goes into it must take hours. Its a craft. Closer to home, Thomas Mallons kicking against Leitrim in the league final last year. It too was an exhibition. People had said how quiet Michael McEvoy was that day, but the upper Hogan Stand view was a dferent one. The Magherafelt mans rehearsed runs were as selfless as they were vital. googletag.cmd.push The same could be said of Odhraacuten Lynchs ability to pick out Danny Tallon, Ciaran McFaul and Padraig Cassidy on Saturday night. Its a skill we should never throw away. The runs of Conor Feeney for Daryl McDermotts kick-outs the same. But what happens when the spaces on the flanks begin to disappear. In the closing stages, when diesel tanks in the outfield runners begin to empty and the dashboard lights start to flash, plan B needs to kick in. In Derrys case the worrying sign is that out and out midfielders are gone. Last year in the qualier clash with Laois, Derry couldnt buy a ball at midfield in the crucial final quarter and bowed out of a game they had within their grasp. The same can be said for the Leitrim game last week. Outside of Emmett Bradley pulling wide, there was no option of a leaping midfielder to pull off something magical. Niall Hollys four catches at midfield against Magherafelt in last years championship were just a memory. Conor McAtamney put in an exhibition of fielding at Glenullin a few years back. Holly is injured and Macca hasnt featured in the league. Sean Dornans catch on Saturday night got the loudest roar of the night in Paacuteirc Esler. “Good man Pat,” roared Down stats man Kevin McGuigan into his ear-piece in the press box when Pat Havern earlier plucked one from the clouds. Rory Burns got most of his kicks away cheaply early in the first half as Derry pulled the line back to midfield. As the half wore on and the Down keeper began to kick with more venom, the Oakleafers hoovered up enough breaking ball to leave them in control. Late on, despite seven wides, Derry looked like they would pull through. Then when Conor Poland scythed down Padraig Cassidy in full flight and got sent to the sin-bin, Rory Burns had only one option. And that was to enter the Neil Collins, Damien McCusker drive er as far as you can mode from the clashes of the s. Along with John OLeary, they were the best in the business. Derry didnt have anyone tograb hold of a game that was ebbing away without them really knowing it. I always remember Mickey C Conlan speaking of his get out clause. If he lost a pre-defined number of kick-outs in a row, Enda Muldoon was the next target. “Big Enda will always get it,” he told me. Slaughtneils Antoacutein McMullan was always able to play the Patsy Bradley card. In the Ulster final win over Kilcoo the Emmets retained  kick-outs out of . All strategic. One year on, against Cavan Gaels press, Patsy – almost licking his lips - was back in the ball game, plucking bullets from the sky as the route one was called again for. Callum Mullan-Young got lambasted in certain quarters after last years county final but when the game was in the mixer. He was left to crash and burn as Glen didnt have an out ball when Magherafelt closed the door on their plan A. In a few weeks when I pen my letter looking for midfielders, it is a long-term project, not a one-dimensional one. More like, bringing back the forgotten skill. Lets face it, we need it. Last week, one player with the desired leap, Conor Glass, was in Tasmania for Hawthorns pre-season training. With us haemorrhaging his like to the AFL, we need to build a wider base. We need toto square one and make sure we tick box number one. Adrian McGuckins recipe for MacRory Cup success, apart from the tough training and his before his time sport psychology, was simple two facing three. Across the pitch, the ball started at the side with three. The ball was delivered from wing to wing. Every two minutes the directive changed. Balls to the chest, one bounce ballsthe pitch was in decent shape and high balls. It covered all eventualities. “Get your arms up like the number ,”hed bellow, in reference to the need for outstretched arms. “Time your run, get your leading knee up and catch the ball at the highest point,”hed insist. Then it would y. Two facing two with a man in the middle for a minute of hell. Fielding high ball after high ball. Simple but unbelievably brilliant. How many coaches are doing it any more  Most people will wrongly say it is outdated but when the game is all about possession, you can never hone this skill enough. First touch is everything. What Derry wouldnt have done for an Enda Muldoon, a Patsy Bradley or a Fergal Doherty in the last ten minutes on Saturday night. Rory Burns would have to scratch his head a bit more and Odhraacuten Lynch wouldve been able to exploit his full repertoire. William Trundles Christmas list will most likely include a reunion with the Christmasaurus. Mine is a long term plan that will provide Derry with a better selection of big, lean, mobile players to play both cards. Peel to the wings for a short and fly through the air to collect a high one above the cluster...in a manner that inspires. Never run away from the basics. ALSO - Players should not have to choose.

Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

We are blessed in team Sinn Feacutein to have depth in leadership, from Vice President Michelle ONeill and our new chief whip, John ODowd.Since Stormont was reinstated, lots of things are learning curves for myself, but the mix of enthusiastic newbies and more experienced older heads in our group means that help with issues is never far away.Over the next two years, I am determined to see delivery for this area coming out of Stormont, and membership of these committees, Communities and The Executive Office in particular, will aid with this.

However, the persuasive powers of the members and their supporters eventually began to make progress, additional money was found, designs were modied and planning approval was eventually granted.He continued: Without the passion and determination of this board of governors my work and that of others wouldnot have achieved the success it did and now Limavady can look forward to having a state-of-the-art school which meets the capacity and needs of wonderful children that are entitled to equality of opportunity to address their educational needs. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Today, Derry Credit Union – whose motto is “For people, not for profit” - has a staff of , over , members with shares totalling almost pound million. Last year,  new members joined Derry Credit Union, bringing its membership to , adults and , minors. At the end of the last financial year, members’ sharestotalled pound,,. As at September , the loan book was valued at pound,,. This is an increase of pound, in the year and brought the total of loans issue since the Credit Unions inception to pound million. googletag.cmd.push At its annual general meeting in November last, the credit committee reported that in the period from October , , to September , last year, , loanswere issued to the value of pound,,.. This was an increase of pound, compared to the previous year and brought the loan book to pound,,. The Abbey Street financial institution has a number of events lined up to mark its th anniversary.  Civic reception One of the first was held on Tuesday night last when management, committee members, staff and members attended a civic reception held by Derry City and Strabane District Council. googletag.cmd.push At the event in the Guildhall, hosted by Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, tributes were paid to the “Derry Six” - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume – for their “forward-thinking” decision to set up the non-profit-making organisation which, since its inception, has loaned out pound million to its members. Cllr Hunter said it was a “delight” to host the civic reception for the Credit Union. She added: “The Credit Union has enabled so many families and people to be on their feet over the past  years. It has been the backbone of the development of Derry. “Through the loyalty and dedication of its members, Derry Credit Union has flourished to become the success that it is today. I hope its success will continue long into the future.” Speaking to the Derry News, Joan Gallagher, Derry Credit Union general manager, said she was “absolutely delighted” at the honour bestowed by the Council. She added: “Derry Credit Union has been a very important institution for Derry and it is appropriate the council mark it with a civic reception. “This kicks off the start of the celebrations for the th anniversary.” Mrs Gallagher described the founders of Northern Irelands first and Irelands third credit union as “absolutely amazing.” She added: “I only recently realised how young they all were – Paddy Joe Doherty passed away recently at the age of , so  years ago he was only  when they started out on the road to developing the Credit Union. “I think Paddy Joe was one of the younger ones and having had a look at the ages of the others, there was none of them over  and I think Paddy Bogside was the oldest.” Looking to the future, Mrs Gallagher said Derry Credit Union would “still be here” in another  years and Brexit would have very little impact on it. She said: “Those guysgave us a gt and for those of us who are still involved, it is our responsibility to protect that and we leave it in a suitable position to hand on. I do believe Derry Credit Union will be here in another  years – for it is part of the city. “Brexit will have very little impact on us – the members have their shares, have their savings – we will still be able to provie the services we have. “We have invested a lot over the past number of years modernising the Credit Union. “At Derry Credit Union, you can come in to the office and do all you business or you can do all your business online.”Mrs Gallagher revealed membership at the Abbey Street office stretched far beyond the citys boundaries. She said: “Our members are not just in Derry – we have members in America, Australia and a number of other countries – we are a sort of worldwide organisation now. We have an e-banking  on which you can apply for your loan at night, we look at your loan application in the morning, we will send you an SMS text to sign and we will have your money in your account that day.”  Not a bank Mrs Gallagher stressed Derry Credit Union was “not a bank.” She said: “We will never be a bank. What distinguishes us is that we have  operating principles which we very closely adhere to. We are a not-for-profit organisation – the banks are for profit and they look at every opportunity to maximise afor themselves. “We charge an interest rate which is very reasonable and we have a rebate on that – once we cover our costs, we give back what we have left to our members.” Mrs Gallagher said Derry had become a very dferent place thanks to the Credit Union. She said: “Since our inception we have loaned out pound million –you take that out of Dderry, what would it be ” Colm McCauley, treasurer, said it was a “great honour and privilege” to be honoured with a civic reception, the first of a number of events planned to mark the landmark anniversary. He added: “There will be a number of events throughout the year and this is one of the first – it is great it is happening. “Hopefully, the Credit Union will grow. We dont keep our heads buried in the sand, we are always thinking strategically at how we can consolidate – we cannot just standstill and we do have a strategic plan to carry that on.” Mr McCauley pointed to the financial situations many people found themselves in at the time the Derry Credit Union was formed as to why so many in the city – over a third of its population – were members of the local institution. He said: “You need to go back a bit when credit facilicities for a large section of the population in Derry were virtually non-existent. The Credit Union was born out of that and it has grown ever since – it is not a profit-making organisation and any surplus goes back to the members.” Sean Hegarty, president, also paid tribute to the six founding members. He said: “It is virtually unheard of that a credit union established  years ago has achieved the volume of growth that Derry Credit Union has – it is very appropriate and we are delighted to be invited along to this civic reception. “Those peoplewere very young by todays standards and they took the brave step forward and had the vision for the benefit of the community. “It is a very emotional time. There have been a lot of people involved from the absolute origins, right through the decades to this very day. “We currently have a board of directors who volunteer and give up their time freely and willingly. “The world has changed greatly and the Credit Union has had to move to stay up with those changes.” Mr Hegarty said there would be a “lot of families” who would find it much dferent without the Credit Union. He added: “They would find it very dficult when it comes to key things in their lives, from simple things from birthdays to Christmas, to the education of their children, needing a bit of work done to their house, needing a new car. “I am not talking necessarily needing a big help but when they do need a bit of help, there is an organisation there for them.” Helen Kivlehan was one of the Credit Unions members in attendance. She said she has a member almost since its inception and revealed what her first loan was for. She said: “My father enrolled us as children and I went on to become an adult member. My first loan was for my wedding. My husband now and I were both members and we both saved in the Credit Union towards our wedding because in our day our parents couldnt really afford it. “We saved up and borrowed the money against our savings and then paid it off.” Mrs Kivlehan said Derry “wouldnt be the place it is now without the Credit Union.” She added: “It is a lesaver for people like my mother and father, who was a docker. “The Credit Union has been very good to me. I have been able to provide education for my children and my grandchildren are all now in the Credit Union and it should be something that is passed on.” Orla ODoherty, a member of the youth committee, encouraged young people to get involved in the Credit Union. She said: “It is a good experience and helps build confidence and to learn new skills.”  How it all began The Credit Union Movement was introduced in Ireland in  by Nora Herlihy with the support of a number of other dedicated pioneers. The experience of most people in Derry in the s and early s was that of high unemployment. Banks and other financial institutions did not advance credit without substantial collateral or guarantees - you had to be a homeowner in order to get a loan and very few people owned their own homes in the late s. Money lenders charged exorbitant rates of interest perpetuating the cycle of hardship. Consequently, the ordinary working class people in the city had only very costly sources of credit available to them. Derry Credit Union was founded by six iniduals whose commitment to their community is beyond refute. Six locals - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume - believed the credit union could be a source of fair and reasonable credit for the ordinary man and woman. They met in a house in the Bogside on October ,  to combine their total savings of eight pounds ten shillings to establish the first credit union in Northern Ireland - and only third on the island of Ireland – a move that changed the fortunes and futures of generations in Derry people for the better.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10967257.jpg","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The -year-old grandmother has seen her fair share of long, hot dry spells and torrential rains, but recently, like so many farmers, Justine has watched helplessly as her crops have been decimated, in turns, by floods and drought. It’s been bad before, but not this bad. ‘‘This year the biggest challenge has been weather. We have experienced here many extremes, heavy rainfall or excessive heat, but now the dry spells are longer, the rains heavier,’’ said Justine..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button ‘‘These challenges mean we are not able to feed well. I now survive on one meal a day, but previously I could afford three meals a day.’’Justine is part of the Ojama Ageing Farmers Group, a collective which received vital support from local charity, Self Help Africa.‘‘Before the project I used to toil like any other old helpless woman in the village. We were people begging from people. I didn’t have access to financial services, but when the group set up, old as I am, I got sunflower seeds which I planted. When I sold my harvest I was able to buy a heer.’’Self Help Africa is doing amazing work in Uganda, helping people get back on their feet after years of displacement and hardship, but where one battle is beingwon, it seems another is looming large, threatening to scupper all the good work.Behind Uganda’s verdant beauty, climate change looks like dulling the shine off the so-called ‘pearl of Africa.’ Prolonged dry seasons and more intense rainfalls have become the new normal. The resulting floods damage homes, crops and businesses, and thus household incomes, They also, of course, pose a serious risk to health due to water-borne disease. Environmental change is a common refrain among the Ojama Ageing Farmers group, which was formed in  and now has  members, made up of women and men. The group’s chairman, John, reflects on Self Help Africa’s assistance. ‘‘Before, feeding ourselves was dficult, but Self Help Africa gave us  bulls for ploughing. They also gave us some groundnut seeds and cassava cuttings, which we have been planting, except for this year - we lack those things due to last year’s heavy rains. Most of our seeds were rotten because there was too much rain, so there was no good harvest. People are not feeding properly now.‘‘There is not any other crop apart from sweet potatoes. We cut them in pieces and then they dry for future eating in February, March, April - that’s what we will use.’’It is a terribly sad story and one echoed by other members of the group.

These protestors against Irish language legislation gathered at Stormont last month as talks including such laws approached their conclusionCurrently, the policy requires a third of the eligible electorate in a Belfast street to sign a petition to begin the process. A letter is then sent to everyone in that street on the electoral register asking for consent to bilingual signage.The resident has three options, ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Don’t Care’. At least two thirdsof the people surveyed must be in favour of the proposal to erect a second street sign in a language other than English..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button If the resident gives a ‘Don’t Care’ reply, ora letter is not ed, it is considered a negative response by the council. Sinn Fein are proposing the council continues with the policy of a third of the eligible electorate in the street initiating the process, but amends the policy so that % plus one of respondents would determinethe petition is successful. The party also proposes non-respondents and ‘Don’t Care’ responses to be treated as void votes, and not to be considered negative responses, as with current practice.DUP group leader George Dorrian said the system “for introducing such street signs has been in operation for some time and there is little rationale for any change to it”.He added: “The focus of the council should be on areas where we can deliver for everyone who lives in Belfast rather than on potential areas of ision.”The Sinn Fein motion said that the council “has one of the most restrictive policies of any council in the North in regards to Irish Language Street Signage Policy”.It adds: “If we, as Elected Members were held to the same standard as this policy in the Local Government elections, not one Member would have been ed to serve on this Council, as we would not have met those restrictive parameters.”Ronan McLaughlin, SF councillor for Black Mountain, said the proposal “would bring us in line with the vast majority of other councils, including Lisburn and Castlereagh. We’re not trying to change the parameters in which the petition for an Irish street sign is triggered”.Members of the People and Communities Committee agreed to defer a decision on the motion until next month.l Morning View, page ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"win a luxury visit to galgorm spa and golf resort  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

election","story":"Michael D Higgins was accompanied by his we Sabina Higgins to vote at a polling station in St Maryrsquos Hospital in Dublin.The president greeted the assembled count staff and press and said he was glad the weather had remained sunny, despite reports of a storm.In Cork, Micheal Martin, the leader of main opposition party Fianna Fail, voted at his local polling station in Ballinlough with his we, daughter and two sons early on Saturday morning.Voting began at am in what is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable elections in years.On a day when Storm Ciara threatens to dampen turnout, the country is having its first Saturday General Election for more than a century.If opinion polls prove correct, Sinn Fein is on course to challenge the -year duopoly of the statersquos two main parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is facing a dficult battle to hang on to power, with recent polls putting his party in third place.In the last major survey of the electorate before polling day, Sinn Fein was leading the popularity stakes on %, with Fianna Fail second on % and Mr Varadkarrsquos party on %.If those levels of support are borne out when the counting of votes begins on Sunday, it would herald a major breakthrough for Sinn Fein south of the border.However, the odds would still be stacked against party leader Mary Lou McDonald leading the next government as Taoiseach.Its polling performance has far surpassed the expectations of party strategists who, coming off the back of several disappointing elections, only fielded  candidates in the race for the Dail parliamentrsquos  seats. vw,vw,px, px\"Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin and family leave after voting at St Anthonyrsquos Boys National School in Ballinlough, Cork That means evenSinn Fein had a perfect day and won all  seats ndash an extremely unlikely outcome in itself ndash it would still end up well short of a majority.No party is expected to reach the -seat threshold to enable it to govern on its own, and a coalition administration of some complexion is almost inevitable.But Sinn Fein is in a slightly dferent position to its two main rivals, as it may be unable to find enough like-minded left-leaning allies to form a workable government.Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, both centre-right in outlook, have unequivocally ruled out any partnership with Sinn Fein, and for either to change position would represent a major U-turn.If it is unable to strike an alliance with either of the other two main parties, Sinn Fein would be unlikely to secure a place in the next government. vw,vw,px, px\"Voting is under way across Ireland Fianna Fail topped the opinion polls early in the campaign, and leader Mr Martin could yet emerge as Irelandrsquos next Taoiseach.Mr Varadkar, meanwhile, will be hoping his administrationrsquos economic record and handling of the Brexit process will convince enough voters to renew his tenure in Government Buildings in Dublin.However, Brexit did not feature prominently in a campaign that was instead dominated by domestic issues such as spiralling rental prices, record-breaking homeless numbers, controversy over the state pension age and a struggling health service.There appears to be a mood for change and Sinn Fein could attract support from younger voters who want to end Fine Gaelrsquos nine years in power but are unwilling to trust Fianna Fail again after the financial crash that marked its last term of office. vw,vw,px, px\"Leo Varadkar faces a tough battle to hang onto power Faced with the Sinn Fein surge, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have been keen to remind the electorate of the partyrsquos historic IRA links and, as the campaign entered its latter stages, the past crimes of the provisional movement drew increasing focus.Mr Varadkarrsquos last government ndash a minority administration that included several independent TDs ndash was sustained in power through a historic confidence and supply arrangement with Fianna Fail.That landmark pact between two parties founded from opposing sides of Irelandrsquos civil war of the s took  days to negotiate following the inconclusive  General Election.Ireland could be in for more protracted government-formation talksthis election produces another fractured result.The willingness of smaller parties such as Labour and the Greens to become a junior coalition partner could prove critical.A new confidence and supply deal cannot be ruled out ndash potentially a reverse of the last one, with Fine Gael supporting a Fianna Fail led-minority.A strong result for Sinn Fein could even force Irelandrsquos two traditional political superpowers to contemplate the once unthinkable ndash a grand coalition in government

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce.

That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
